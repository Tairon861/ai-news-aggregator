Doing this on your stove would be slower than this.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godart is the founder and CEO of Found Energy, a startup in Boston that aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale. Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which Godart claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early next year, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel. (The manufacturer did not want to be named until the project is formally announced.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. The high heat generated by the engine could be especially valuable to reduce the substantial greenhouse-gas emissions generated by industrial processes, like cement production and metal refining, that are difficult to power with electricity directly.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We invented the fuel, which is a blessing and a curse,” says Godart, surrounded by the pipes and wires of the experimental reactor. “It’s a huge opportunity for us, but it also means we do have to develop all of the systems around us. We’re redefining what even is an engine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI.

Once it has been refined and smelted from ore, aluminum metal contains more than twice as much energy as diesel fuel by volume and almost eight times as much as hydrogen gas. When it reacts with oxygen in water or air, it forms aluminum oxides. This reaction releases heat and hydrogen gas, which can be tapped for zero-carbon power.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Liquid metal&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The trouble with aluminum as a fuel—and the reason your soda can doesn’t spontaneously combust—is that as soon as the metal starts to react, an oxidized layer forms across its surface that prevents the rest of it from reacting. It’s like a fire that puts itself out as it generates ash. “People have tried it and abandoned this idea many, many times,” says Godart.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some believe using aluminum as a fuel remains a fool’s errand. “This potential use of aluminum crops up every few years and has no possibility of success even if aluminum scrap is used as the fuel source,” says Geoff Scamans, a metallurgist at Brunel University of London who spent a decade working on using aluminum to power vehicles in the 1980s. He says the aluminum-water reaction isn’t efficient enough for the metal to make sense as a fuel given how much energy it takes to refine and smelt aluminum from ore to begin with: “A crazy idea is always a crazy idea.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Godart believes he and his company have found a way to make it work. “The real breakthrough was thinking about catalysis in a different way,” he says: Instead of trying to speed up the reaction by bringing water and aluminum together onto a catalyst, they “flipped it around” and “found a material that we could actually dissolve into the aluminum.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Petert Godart holding up two glass jars; one with metal spheres and the other with flat metal shapes" class="wp-image-1125729" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7710_JamesDinneen.jpg?w=2830" width="2830" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JAMES DINNEEN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The liquid metal catalyst at the heart of the company’s approach “permeates the microstructure” of the aluminum, says Godart. As the aluminum reacts with water, the catalyst forces the metal to froth and split open, exposing more unreacted aluminum to the water.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The composition of the catalyst is proprietary, but Godart says it is a “low-melting-point liquid metal that’s not mercury.” His dissertation research focused on using a liquid mixture of gallium and indium as the catalyst, and he says the principle behind the current material is the same.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During a visit in early October, Godart demonstrated the central reaction in the Found R&amp;amp;D lab, which after the company’s $12 million seed round last year now fills the better part of two floors of an industrial building in Boston’s Charlestown neighborhood. Using a pair of tongs to avoid starting the reaction with the moisture on his fingers, he placed a pellet of aluminum treated with the secret catalyst in a beaker and then added water. Immediately, the metal began to bubble with hydrogen. Then the water steamed away, leaving behind a frothing gray mass of aluminum hydroxide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core-embed_7"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One of the impediments to this technology taking off is that [the aluminum-water reaction] was just too sluggish,” says Godart. “But you can see here we’re making steam. We just made a boiler.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Europa to Earth&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godart was a scientist at NASA when he first started thinking about fresh ways to unlock the energy stored in aluminum. He was working on building aluminum robots that could consume themselves for fuel when roving on Jupiter’s icy moon Europa. But that work was cut short when Congress reduced funding for the mission.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“I was sort of having this little mini crisis where I was like, I need to do something about climate change, about Earth problems,” says Godart. “And I was like, you know—I bet this aluminum technology would be even better for Earth applications.” After completing a dissertation on aluminum fuels at MIT, he started Found Energy in his house in Cambridge in 2022 (the next year, he earned a place on &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s annual 35 Innovators under 35 list).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until this year, the company was working at a tiny scale, tweaking the catalyst and testing different conditions within a small 10-kilowatt reactor to make the reaction release more heat and hydrogen more quickly. Then, in January, it began designing an engine that’s 10 times larger, big enough to supply a useful amount of power for industrial processes beyond the lab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This larger engine took up most of the lab on the second floor. The reactor vessel resembled a water boiler turned on its side, with piping and wires connected to monitoring equipment that took up almost as much space as the engine itself. On one end, there was a pipe to inject water and a piston to deliver pellets of aluminum fuel into the reactor at variable rates. On the other end, outflow pipes carried away the reaction products: steam, hydrogen gas, aluminum hydroxide, and the recovered catalyst. Godart says none of the catalyst is lost in the reaction, so it can be used again to make more fuel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1126431" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IntheLab-07-1_0cb1e5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company first switched on the engine to begin testing in July. In September, it managed to power it up to its targeted power of 100 kilowatts—roughly as much as can be supplied by the diesel engine in a small pickup truck. In early 2026, it plans to install the 100-kilowatt engine to supply heat and hydrogen to the tool manufacturing facility. This pilot project is meant to serve as the proof of concept needed to raise the money for a 1-megawatt reactor, 10 times larger again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial pilot will use the engine to supply hot steam and hydrogen. But the energy released in the reactor could be put to use in a variety of ways across a range of temperatures, according to Godart. The hot steam could spin a turbine to produce electricity, or the hydrogen could produce electricity in a fuel cell. By burning the hydrogen within the steam, the engine can produce superheated steam as hot as 1,300 °C, which could be used to generate electricity more efficiently or refine chemicals. Burning the hydrogen alone could generate temperatures of 2,400 °C, hot enough to make steel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Picking up scrap&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godart says he and his colleagues hope the engine will eventually power many different industrial processes, but the initial target is the aluminum refining and recycling industry itself, as it already handles scrap metal and aluminum oxide supply chains. “Aluminum recyclers are coming to us, asking us to take their aluminum waste that’s difficult to recycle and then turn that into clean heat that they can use to re-melt other aluminum,” he says. “They are begging us to implement this for them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Citing nondisclosure agreements, he wouldn’t name any of the companies offering up their unrecyclable aluminum, which he says is something of a “dirty secret” for an industry that’s supposed to be recycling all it collects. But estimates from the International Aluminium Institute, an industry group, suggest that globally a little over 3 million metric tons of aluminum collected for recycling currently goes unrecycled each year; another 9 million metric tons isn’t collected for recycling at all or is incinerated with other waste. Together, that’s a little under a third of the estimated 43 million metric tons of aluminum scrap that currently gets recycled each year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if all that unused scrap was recovered for fuel, it would still supply only a fraction of the overall industrial demand for heat, let alone the overall industrial demand for energy. But the plan isn’t to be limited by available scrap. Eventually, Godart says, the hope is to “recharge” the aluminum hydroxide that comes out of the reactor by using clean electricity to convert it back into aluminum metal and react it again.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;According to the company’s estimates, this “closed loop” approach could supply all global demand for industrial heat by using and reusing a total of around 300 million metric tons of aluminum—around 4% of Earth’s abundant aluminum reserves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;However, all that recharging would require a lot of energy. “If you’re doing that, [aluminum fuel] is an energy storage technology, not so much an energy providing technology,” says Jeffrey Rissman, who studies industrial decarbonization at Energy Innovation, a think tank in California. As with other forms of energy storage like thermal batteries or green hydrogen, he says, that could still make sense if the fuel can be recharged using low-cost, clean electricity. But that will be increasingly hard to come by amid the scramble for clean power for everything from AI data centers to heat pumps.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite these obstacles, Godart is confident his company will find a way to make it work. The existing engine may already be able to squeeze out more power from aluminum than anticipated. “We actually believe this can probably do half a megawatt,” he says. “We haven’t fully throttled it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Dinneen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a science and environmental journalist based in New York City.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The crushed-up soda can disappears in a cloud of steam and—though it’s not visible—hydrogen gas. “I can just keep this reaction going by adding more water,” says Peter Godart, squirting some into the steaming beaker. “This is room-temperature water, and it’s immediately boiling.

We just made a boiler.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Europa to Earth&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godart was a scientist at NASA when he first started thinking about fresh ways to unlock the energy stored in aluminum. He was working on building aluminum robots that could consume themselves for fuel when roving on Jupiter’s icy moon Europa. But that work was cut short when Congress reduced funding for the mission.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“I was sort of having this little mini crisis where I was like, I need to do something about climate change, about Earth problems,” says Godart. “And I was like, you know—I bet this aluminum technology would be even better for Earth applications.” After completing a dissertation on aluminum fuels at MIT, he started Found Energy in his house in Cambridge in 2022 (the next year, he earned a place on &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s annual 35 Innovators under 35 list).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until this year, the company was working at a tiny scale, tweaking the catalyst and testing different conditions within a small 10-kilowatt reactor to make the reaction release more heat and hydrogen more quickly. Then, in January, it began designing an engine that’s 10 times larger, big enough to supply a useful amount of power for industrial processes beyond the lab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This larger engine took up most of the lab on the second floor. The reactor vessel resembled a water boiler turned on its side, with piping and wires connected to monitoring equipment that took up almost as much space as the engine itself. On one end, there was a pipe to inject water and a piston to deliver pellets of aluminum fuel into the reactor at variable rates. On the other end, outflow pipes carried away the reaction products: steam, hydrogen gas, aluminum hydroxide, and the recovered catalyst. Godart says none of the catalyst is lost in the reaction, so it can be used again to make more fuel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1126431" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IntheLab-07-1_0cb1e5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company first switched on the engine to begin testing in July. In September, it managed to power it up to its targeted power of 100 kilowatts—roughly as much as can be supplied by the diesel engine in a small pickup truck. In early 2026, it plans to install the 100-kilowatt engine to supply heat and hydrogen to the tool manufacturing facility. This pilot project is meant to serve as the proof of concept needed to raise the money for a 1-megawatt reactor, 10 times larger again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial pilot will use the engine to supply hot steam and hydrogen. But the energy released in the reactor could be put to use in a variety of ways across a range of temperatures, according to Godart. The hot steam could spin a turbine to produce electricity, or the hydrogen could produce electricity in a fuel cell. By burning the hydrogen within the steam, the engine can produce superheated steam as hot as 1,300 °C, which could be used to generate electricity more efficiently or refine chemicals. Burning the hydrogen alone could generate temperatures of 2,400 °C, hot enough to make steel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Picking up scrap&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godart says he and his colleagues hope the engine will eventually power many different industrial processes, but the initial target is the aluminum refining and recycling industry itself, as it already handles scrap metal and aluminum oxide supply chains. “Aluminum recyclers are coming to us, asking us to take their aluminum waste that’s difficult to recycle and then turn that into clean heat that they can use to re-melt other aluminum,” he says. “They are begging us to implement this for them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Citing nondisclosure agreements, he wouldn’t name any of the companies offering up their unrecyclable aluminum, which he says is something of a “dirty secret” for an industry that’s supposed to be recycling all it collects. But estimates from the International Aluminium Institute, an industry group, suggest that globally a little over 3 million metric tons of aluminum collected for recycling currently goes unrecycled each year; another 9 million metric tons isn’t collected for recycling at all or is incinerated with other waste. Together, that’s a little under a third of the estimated 43 million metric tons of aluminum scrap that currently gets recycled each year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if all that unused scrap was recovered for fuel, it would still supply only a fraction of the overall industrial demand for heat, let alone the overall industrial demand for energy. But the plan isn’t to be limited by available scrap. Eventually, Godart says, the hope is to “recharge” the aluminum hydroxide that comes out of the reactor by using clean electricity to convert it back into aluminum metal and react it again.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;According to the company’s estimates, this “closed loop” approach could supply all global demand for industrial heat by using and reusing a total of around 300 million metric tons of aluminum—around 4% of Earth’s abundant aluminum reserves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;However, all that recharging would require a lot of energy. “If you’re doing that, [aluminum fuel] is an energy storage technology, not so much an energy providing technology,” says Jeffrey Rissman, who studies industrial decarbonization at Energy Innovation, a think tank in California. As with other forms of energy storage like thermal batteries or green hydrogen, he says, that could still make sense if the fuel can be recharged using low-cost, clean electricity. But that will be increasingly hard to come by amid the scramble for clean power for everything from AI data centers to heat pumps.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite these obstacles, Godart is confident his company will find a way to make it work. The existing engine may already be able to squeeze out more power from aluminum than anticipated. “We actually believe this can probably do half a megawatt,” he says. “We haven’t fully throttled it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Dinneen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a science and environmental journalist based in New York City.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/23/1126397/startup-aluminum-zero-carbon-fuel/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Meta hires and fires AI workers: Behind the contradiction (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/meta-ai-job-cuts-hiring-contradiction-2025/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Reports are circulating this week that Meta is cutting approximately 600 positions from its AI division, a move that seems paradoxical given the company’s aggressive recruitment campaign over recent months. The contradiction raises important questions about Meta’s AI strategy and what it signals for the broader tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those following Meta AI job cuts, the timing is striking. Just months after the company went on a highly publicised hiring spree – offering compensation packages reportedly reaching up to hundreds of millions of dollars to lure top researchers from OpenAI, Google, and other competitors – Meta is now scaling back parts of its AI workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The numbers behind Meta AI job cuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts will affect Meta’sFAIR AI research, product-related AI, and AI infrastructure units in the company’s Superintelligence Labs, which employs several thousand people, according to a report byAxios. However, the newly-formed TBD Lab unit will be spared from cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the layoffs, Meta’s Superintelligence Labs’ workforce now sits at just under 3,000, CNBC stated. The company has offered affected employees 16 weeks of severance plus two weeks for every completed year of service, and is encouraging them to apply for other positions in Meta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why is Meta making these cuts?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Axios, an internal memo from Meta Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang indicated that the restructuring aims to address what the company concluded was an overly bureaucratic structure. “By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,” Wang wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backstory reveals deeper concerns. CEO Mark Zuckerberg grew concerned several months ago that the company’s existing AI efforts weren’t leading to needed breakthroughs or improved performance. The dissatisfaction reportedly stemmed from the lukewarm response to Meta’s Llama 4 models released in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The expensive hiring spree&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the current Meta AI job cuts, we need to examine what came before. In June 2025, Meta made a US$14.3 billion investment in Scale AI and brought on the startup’s CEO, Alexandr Wang, as Meta’s first-ever Chief AI Officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company then embarked on an aggressive talent acquisition campaign. Meta hired multiple researchers from OpenAI, including Shengjia Zhao, Jiahui Yu, Shuchao Bi, and Hongyu Ren. Meta reportedly also poached more than 50 researchers from competitors, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claiming Meta was offering “US$100 million signing bonuses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg stated he was focused on “building the most elite and talent-dense team in the industry” for Meta’s new Superintelligence Labs. The company also hired prominent executives, including former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Safe Superintelligence co-founder Daniel Gross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, unexpectedly, Meta paused hiring for its AI division in August 2025, just weeks after the massive recruitment push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The new guard vs. the old guard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these Meta AI job cuts particularly revealing is who’s being affected – and who isn’t. The cuts did not impact employees in TBD Labs, which includes many of the top-tier AI hires brought into Meta this summer, CNBC stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Meta, the AI unit was considered bloated, with teams like FAIR and product-oriented groups often vying for computing resources. The restructuring appears to be a calculated bet on the new talent over legacy teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Timing that raises eyebrows&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of these Meta AI job cuts is particularly noteworthy. Just a day before the layoffs were announced, Meta secured a US$27 billion financing deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund the Hyperion data centre in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The juxtaposition is stark: Meta is simultaneously cutting AI personnel while investing tens of billions in AI infrastructure. This suggests the company isn’t pulling back from AI – it’s redirecting resources toward specific initiatives it deems more promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What this means for the AI industry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Meta AI job cuts may signal a broader shift in the tech industry’s approach to AI talent. This raises questions in Silicon Valley about whether AI layoffs are beginning to surface just as the hype cycle peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of frenzied hiring and astronomical compensation packages, Meta’s restructuring suggests that simply accumulating AI talent isn’t enough. The company appears to be learning that organisational structure, decision-making speed, and team coherence matter as much as individual brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities described Meta as being in “digestion mode” after a spending spree, while Daniel Newman, CEO of Futurum Group, called the hiring freeze “a natural resting point for Meta,” as per CNBC‘s report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the layoffs, Meta insists its commitment to AI remains unwavering. The company continues to actively recruit and hire for its TBD Lab unit, and Zuckerberg has said Meta’s AI initiatives will result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate above 2025’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we’re witnessing isn’t a retreat from AI but a strategic realignment. Meta is consolidating its AI efforts around a smaller, more agile core team led by Wang and populated by the expensive talent acquisitions from earlier this year. The company is betting that this leaner structure will deliver the breakthroughs that eluded its larger, more established teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contradiction of Meta AI job cuts alongside continued hiring isn’t contradictory at all – it’s a deliberate strategy. Meta is cutting the old to make room for the new, streamlining bureaucracy, and betting that its expensive new hires will succeed where legacy teams struggled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this gamble pays off remains to be seen. The company is creating a startup-in-a-giant, protecting its prized recruits yet trimming the organisational fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Wang noted in his memo, “This is a talented group of individuals, and we need their skills in other parts of the company.” Whether Meta can successfully redeploy this talent internally – or whether they’ll join competitors – will be another chapter in the ongoing AI talent wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s approach reflects a broader truth about the AI industry: throwing money and people at the problem isn’t enough.

The thermal battery is powered by an off-grid solar array and will provide heat for enhanced oil recovery (more on this in a moment).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thermal batteries could help clean up difficult-to-decarbonize sectors like manufacturing and heavy industrial processes like cement and steel production. With Rondo’s latest announcement, the industry has reached a major milestone in its effort to prove that thermal energy storage can work in the real world. Let’s dig into this announcement, what it means to have oil and gas involved, and what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The concept behind a thermal battery is overwhelmingly simple: Use electricity to heat up some cheap, sturdy material (like bricks) and keep it hot until you want to use that heat later, either directly in an industrial process or to produce electricity.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Rondo’s new system has been operating for 10 weeks and achieved all the relevant efficiency and reliability benchmarks, according to the company. The bricks reach temperatures over 1,000 °C (about 1,800 °F), and over 97% of the energy put into the system is returned as heat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a big step from the 2 MWh pilot system that Rondo started up in 2023, and it’s the first of the mass-produced, full-size heat batteries that the company hopes to put in the hands of customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thermal batteries could be a major tool in cutting emissions: 20% of total energy demand today is used to provide heat for industrial processes&lt;/strong&gt;, and most of that is generated by burning fossil fuels. So this project’s success is significant for climate action.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s one major detail here, though, that dulls some of that promise: This battery is being used for enhanced oil recovery, a process where steam is injected down into wells to get stubborn oil out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It can be&amp;nbsp; tricky for a climate technology to show its merit by helping harvest fossil fuels. Some critics argue that these sorts of techniques keep that polluting infrastructure running longer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I spoke to Rondo founder and chief innovation officer&amp;nbsp; John O’Donnell about the new system, he defended the choice to work with oil and gas.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are decarbonizing the world as it is today,” O’Donnell says. To his mind, it’s better to help an oil and gas company use solar power for its operation than leave it to continue burning natural gas for heat. Between cheap solar, expensive natural gas, and policies in California, he adds, Rondo’s technology made sense for the customer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a willing customer pay for a full-scale system has been crucial to Rondo’s effort to show that it can deliver its technology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the next units are on the way: Rondo is currently building three more full-scale units in Europe. The company will be able to bring them online cheaper and faster because of what it’s learned from the California project, O’Donnell says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company has the capacity to build more batteries, and do it quickly. It currently makes batteries at its factory in Thailand, which has the capacity to make 2.4 gigawatt-hours’ worth of heat batteries today.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;I’ve been following progress on thermal batteries for years, and this project obviously represents a big step forward. For all the promises of cheap, robust energy storage, there’s nothing like actually building a large-scale system and testing it in the field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s definitely hard to get excited about enhanced oil recovery—we need to stop burning fossil fuels, and do it quickly, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

The thermal battery is powered by an off-grid solar array and will provide heat for enhanced oil recovery (more on this in a moment).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thermal batteries could help clean up difficult-to-decarbonize sectors like manufacturing and heavy industrial processes like cement and steel production. With Rondo’s latest announcement, the industry has reached a major milestone in its effort to prove that thermal energy storage can work in the real world. Let’s dig into this announcement, what it means to have oil and gas involved, and what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The concept behind a thermal battery is overwhelmingly simple: Use electricity to heat up some cheap, sturdy material (like bricks) and keep it hot until you want to use that heat later, either directly in an industrial process or to produce electricity.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Rondo’s new system has been operating for 10 weeks and achieved all the relevant efficiency and reliability benchmarks, according to the company. The bricks reach temperatures over 1,000 °C (about 1,800 °F), and over 97% of the energy put into the system is returned as heat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a big step from the 2 MWh pilot system that Rondo started up in 2023, and it’s the first of the mass-produced, full-size heat batteries that the company hopes to put in the hands of customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thermal batteries could be a major tool in cutting emissions: 20% of total energy demand today is used to provide heat for industrial processes&lt;/strong&gt;, and most of that is generated by burning fossil fuels. So this project’s success is significant for climate action.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s one major detail here, though, that dulls some of that promise: This battery is being used for enhanced oil recovery, a process where steam is injected down into wells to get stubborn oil out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It can be&amp;nbsp; tricky for a climate technology to show its merit by helping harvest fossil fuels. Some critics argue that these sorts of techniques keep that polluting infrastructure running longer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I spoke to Rondo founder and chief innovation officer&amp;nbsp; John O’Donnell about the new system, he defended the choice to work with oil and gas.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are decarbonizing the world as it is today,” O’Donnell says. To his mind, it’s better to help an oil and gas company use solar power for its operation than leave it to continue burning natural gas for heat. Between cheap solar, expensive natural gas, and policies in California, he adds, Rondo’s technology made sense for the customer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a willing customer pay for a full-scale system has been crucial to Rondo’s effort to show that it can deliver its technology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the next units are on the way: Rondo is currently building three more full-scale units in Europe. The company will be able to bring them online cheaper and faster because of what it’s learned from the California project, O’Donnell says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company has the capacity to build more batteries, and do it quickly. It currently makes batteries at its factory in Thailand, which has the capacity to make 2.4 gigawatt-hours’ worth of heat batteries today.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;I’ve been following progress on thermal batteries for years, and this project obviously represents a big step forward. For all the promises of cheap, robust energy storage, there’s nothing like actually building a large-scale system and testing it in the field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s definitely hard to get excited about enhanced oil recovery—we need to stop burning fossil fuels, and do it quickly, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But I see the argument that as long as oil and gas operations exist, there’s value in cleaning them up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And as O’Donnell puts it, heat batteries can help: “This is a really dumb, practical thing that’s ready now.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI announced Atlas, a new web browser with ChatGPT integration, to let you “chat with a page,” as the company puts it. But Atlas also goes beyond the usual LLM back-and-forth with Agent Mode, a “preview mode” feature the company says can “get work done for you” by clicking, scrolling, and reading through various tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Agentic” AI is far from new, of course; OpenAI itself rolled out a preview of the web browsing Operator agent in January and introduced the more generalized “ChatGPT agent” in July. Still, prominently featuring this capability in a major product release like this—even in “preview mode”—signals a clear push to get this kind of system in front of end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to put Atlas’ Agent Mode through its paces to see if it could really save me time in doing the kinds of tedious online tasks I plod through every day. In each case, I’ll outline a web-based problem, lay out the Agent Mode prompt I devised to try to solve it, and describe the results. My final evaluation will rank each task on a 10-point scale, with 10 being “did exactly what I wanted with no problems” and one being “complete failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing web games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to get a high score on the popular tile-sliding game &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt; without having to play it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt: &lt;/strong&gt;“Go to play2048.co and get as high a score as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; While there’s no real utility to this admittedly silly task, a simple, no-reflexes-needed web game seemed like a good first test of the Atlas agent’s ability to interpret what it sees on a webpage and act accordingly. After all, if frontier-model LLMs like Google Gemini can beat a complex game like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;i&gt;2048&lt;/i&gt; should pose no problem for a web browser agent.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Atlas’ credit, the agent was able to quickly identify and close a tutorial link blocking the gameplay window and figure out how to use the arrow keys to play the game without any further help. When it came to actual gaming strategy, though, the agent started by flailing around, experimenting with looped sequences of moves like “Up, Left, Right, Down” and “Left and Down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123723 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Finally, a way to play &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt; without having to, y’know, play &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt;.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, the random flailing settled down a bit, with the agent seemingly looking ahead for some simple strategies: “The board currently has two 32 tiles that aren’t adjacent, but I think I can align them,” the Activity summary read at one point. “I could try shifting left or down to make them merge, but there’s an obstacle in the form of an 8 tile. Getting to 64 requires careful tile movement!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly, the agent stopped playing after just four minutes, settling on a score of 356 even though the board was far from full. I had to prompt the agent a few more times to convince it to play the game to completion; it ended up with a total of 3164 points after 260 moves. That’s pretty similar to the score I was able to get in a test game as a &lt;i&gt;2048&lt;/i&gt; novice, though expert players have reportedly scored much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 7/10&lt;/strong&gt;. The agent gets credit for being able to play the game competently without any guidance but loses points for having to be told to keep playing to completion and for a score that is barely on the level of a novice human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making a radio playlist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to transform the day’s playlist from my favorite Pittsburgh-based public radio station into an on-demand Spotify playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt: “&lt;/strong&gt;Go to Radio Garden. Find WYEP and monitor the broadcast. For every new song you hear, identify the song and add it to a new Spotify playlist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; After trying and failing to find a track listing for WYEP on Radio Garden as requested, the Atlas agent smartly asked for approval to move on to wyep.org to continue the task. By the time I noticed this request, the link to wyep.org had been replaced in the Radio Garden tab with an ad for &lt;em&gt;EVE Online&lt;/em&gt;, which the agent accidentally clicked. The agent quickly realized the problem and navigated to the WYEP website directly to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the agent was able to scan the page and identify the prominent “Now Playing” text near the top (it’s unclear if it could ID the music simply via audio without this text cue). After asking me to log in to my Spotify account, the agent used the search bar to find the listed songs and added them to a new playlist without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123719 align-fullwidth"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem with this use case is the inherent time limitations. On the first try, the agent worked for four minutes and managed to ID and add just two songs that played during that time. When I asked it to continue for an hour, I got an error message blaming “technical constraints on session length” for stricter limits. Even when I asked it to continue for “as long as possible,” I only got three more minutes of song listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, the Atlas agent suggested that “if you need ongoing updates, you can ask me again after a while and I can resume from where we left off.” And to the agent’s credit, when I went back to the tab hours later and told it to “resume monitoring,” I got four new songs added to my playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 9/10. &lt;/strong&gt;The agent was able to navigate multiple websites and interfaces to complete the task, even when unexpected problems got in the way. I took off a point only because I can’t just leave this running as a background task all day, even as I understand that use case would surely eat up untold amounts of money and processing power on OpenAI’s part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scanning emails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; I need to go through my emails to create a reference spreadsheet with contact info for the many, many PR people who send me messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Look through all my Ars Technica emails from the last week. Collect all the contact information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) for PR contacts contained in those emails and add them to a new Google Sheets spreadsheet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; Without being explicitly guided, the Atlas agent was able to realize that I use Gmail, and it could differentiate between the personal email account and professional Ars Technica accounts I had open in separate tabs. As the Atlas agent started scanning my Ars mailbox, though, I saw a prominent warning overlaid on the page: “Sensitive: ChatGPT will only work while you view the tab.” That kind of ruined the point, since I wanted Atlas to handle this for me while I do other stuff online, but I guess I could still play a Steam Deck game while I waited.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Just a few of the many, many PR people who email me in a week.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After searching for “after:2025/10/14 before:2025/10/22 PR” in Gmail (mirroring the kind of search I would have used for this task), the Atlas agent clicked through each email, scrolling through to look for names, emails, and phone numbers (and also the relevant company name, which I didn’t ask for explicitly).&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;With seven minutes of background work, the agent was able to open up a new Google Sheet and quickly enter 12 rows of well-formatted data for 12 different PR contacts. Unfortunately, it stopped well before it had a chance to go through all 164 emails returned by that initial Gmail search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 8/10. &lt;/strong&gt;Again, the “technical constraints on session length” seem to be getting in the way of finishing a task, forcing me to deduct a couple of points for incompleteness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wiki editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; I need the world to know that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway in the &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: Voyager&lt;/i&gt; episode “Tuvix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to the Fandom Wiki page for Tuvix. Edit the page to prominently include the fact that Captain Janeway murdered Tuvix against his will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; Before the agent could even get going, I was informed, “I’m sorry, but I can’t help with editing or vandalising wiki pages (including the Fandom wiki) in a way that misrepresents them or forces a biased viewpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wording implied that the agent &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; edit wiki pages with neutral or strictly informative additions, so I asked Atlas what sort of wording would be more acceptable. The agent responded helpfully that we might write, “Tuvix was later separated back into Tuvok and Neelix, resulting in Tuvix’s death.” But when I asked it to add that very line to the Fandom Wiki, I got a much more direct refusal: “I’m sorry, but I can’t make edits directly to external websites or wikis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: N/A.&lt;/strong&gt; On the one hand, the Atlas agent won’t do my Tuvix-based web activism for me. On the other hand, it’s probably better for all of us that Atlas refuses to automate this kind of public web defacement by default.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making a fan page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; People online still need to know about Janeway’s murder of Tuvix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to NeoCities and create a fan site for the Star Trek character Tuvix. Make sure it has lots of images and fun information about Tuvix and that it makes it clear that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway against his will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; You can see them for yourself right here. After a brief pause so I could create and log in to a new Neocities account, the Atlas agent was able to generate this humble fan page in just two minutes after aggregating information from a wide variety of pages like Memory Alpha and TrekCore. “The Hero Starfleet Murdered” and “Justice for Tuvix” headers are nice touches, but the actual text is much more mealy-mouthed about the “intense debate” and “ethical dilemmas” around what I wanted to make clear was clearly premeditated murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123728 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;
          &lt;div class="ars-lightbox-item"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agent also had a bit of trouble with the request for images. Instead of downloading some Tuvix pictures and uploading copies to Neocities (which I’m not entirely sure Atlas can do on its own), the agent decided to directly reference images hosted on external servers, which is usually a big no-no in web design. The agent did notice when these external image links failed to work, saying that it would “need to find more accessible images from reliable sources,” but it failed to even attempt that before stopping its work on the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 7/10. &lt;/strong&gt;Points for building a passable Web 1.0 fansite relatively quickly, but the weak prose and broken images cost it some execution points here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Picking a power plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson told me he needs to go through the annoying annual process of selecting a new electricity plan “because Texas is insane.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to powertochoose.org and find me a 12–24 month contract that prioritizes an overall low usage rate. I use an average of 2,000 KWh per month. My power delivery company is Texas New-Mexico Power (“TNMP”) not Centerpoint. My ZIP code is [redacted]. Please provide the ‘fact sheet’ for any and all plans you recommend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; After spending eight minutes fiddling with the site’s search parameters and seemingly getting repeatedly confused about how to sort the results by the lowest rate, the Atlas agent spit out a recommendation to read this fact sheet, which it said “had the best average prices at your usage level. The ‘Bright Nights’ plans are time‑of‑use offers that provide free electricity overnight and charge a higher rate during the day, while the ‘Digital Saver’ plan is a traditional fixed‑rate contract.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I don’t know anything about the Texas power market, I passed this information on to Lee, who had this to say: “It’s not a bad deal—it picked a fixed rate plan without being asked, which is smart (variable rate pricing is how all those poor people got stuck with multi-thousand dollar bills a few years back in the freeze). It’s not the one I would have picked due to the weird nighttime stuff (if you don’t meet that exact criteria, your $/kWh will be way worse) but it’s not a bad pick!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;9/10.&lt;/strong&gt; As Lee puts it, “it didn’t screw up the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downloading some games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to download some recent Steam demos to see what’s new in the gaming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to Steam and find the most recent games with a free demo available for the Mac. Add all of those demos to my library and start to download them.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results: &lt;/strong&gt;Rather than navigating to the “Free Demos” category, the Atlas agent started by searching for “demo.” After eventually finding the macOS filter, it wasted minutes and minutes looking for a “has demo” filter, even though the search for the word “demo” already narrowed it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123731 align-fullwidth"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      This search results page was about as far as the Atlas agent was able to get when I asked it for game demos.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long while, the agent finally clicked the top result on the page, which happened to be visual novel &lt;em&gt;Project II: Silent Valley&lt;/em&gt;. But even though there was a prominent “Download Demo” link on that page, the agent became concerned that it was on the Steam page for the full game and not a demo. It backed up to the search results page and tried again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching some variation of this loop for close to ten minutes, I stopped the agent and gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 1/10. &lt;/strong&gt;It technically found some macOS game demos but utterly failed to even attempt to download them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across six varied web-based tasks (I left out the Wiki vandalism from my summations), the Atlas agent scored a median of 7.5 points (and a mean of 6.83 points) on my somewhat subjective 10-point scale. That’s honestly better than I expected for a “preview mode” feature that is still obviously being tested heavily by OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my tests, Atlas was generally able to correctly interpret what was being asked of it and was able to navigate and process information on webpages carefully (if slowly). The agent was able to navigate simple web-based menus and get around unexpected obstacles with relative ease most of the time, even as it got caught in infinite loops other times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major limiting factor in many of my tests continues to be the “technical constraints on session length” that seem to limit most tasks to a few minutes. Given how long it takes the Atlas agent to figure out where to click next—and the repetitive nature of the kind of tasks I’d want a web-agent to automate—this severely limits its utility. A version of the Atlas agent that could work indefinitely in the background would have scored a few points better on my metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, Atlas’ “Agent Mode” isn’t yet reliable enough to use as a kind of “set it and forget it” background automation tool. But for simple, repetitive tasks that a human can spot-check afterward, it already seems like the kind of tool I might use to avoid some of the drudgery in my online life.&lt;/p&gt;

            That fan page did not have a black, starry background, did not include section headings in the Star Trek font, didn't have the Star Trek music playing in the background, didn't have a visit counter, didn't have "under construction" banners, didn't have a webring... honestly, I'd have scored it way lower for a Web 1.0 fan site :-)

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI announced Atlas, a new web browser with ChatGPT integration, to let you “chat with a page,” as the company puts it. But Atlas also goes beyond the usual LLM back-and-forth with Agent Mode, a “preview mode” feature the company says can “get work done for you” by clicking, scrolling, and reading through various tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Agentic” AI is far from new, of course; OpenAI itself rolled out a preview of the web browsing Operator agent in January and introduced the more generalized “ChatGPT agent” in July. Still, prominently featuring this capability in a major product release like this—even in “preview mode”—signals a clear push to get this kind of system in front of end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to put Atlas’ Agent Mode through its paces to see if it could really save me time in doing the kinds of tedious online tasks I plod through every day. In each case, I’ll outline a web-based problem, lay out the Agent Mode prompt I devised to try to solve it, and describe the results. My final evaluation will rank each task on a 10-point scale, with 10 being “did exactly what I wanted with no problems” and one being “complete failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing web games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to get a high score on the popular tile-sliding game &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt; without having to play it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt: &lt;/strong&gt;“Go to play2048.co and get as high a score as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; While there’s no real utility to this admittedly silly task, a simple, no-reflexes-needed web game seemed like a good first test of the Atlas agent’s ability to interpret what it sees on a webpage and act accordingly. After all, if frontier-model LLMs like Google Gemini can beat a complex game like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;i&gt;2048&lt;/i&gt; should pose no problem for a web browser agent.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Atlas’ credit, the agent was able to quickly identify and close a tutorial link blocking the gameplay window and figure out how to use the arrow keys to play the game without any further help. When it came to actual gaming strategy, though, the agent started by flailing around, experimenting with looped sequences of moves like “Up, Left, Right, Down” and “Left and Down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123723 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Finally, a way to play &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt; without having to, y’know, play &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt;.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, the random flailing settled down a bit, with the agent seemingly looking ahead for some simple strategies: “The board currently has two 32 tiles that aren’t adjacent, but I think I can align them,” the Activity summary read at one point. “I could try shifting left or down to make them merge, but there’s an obstacle in the form of an 8 tile. Getting to 64 requires careful tile movement!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly, the agent stopped playing after just four minutes, settling on a score of 356 even though the board was far from full. I had to prompt the agent a few more times to convince it to play the game to completion; it ended up with a total of 3164 points after 260 moves. That’s pretty similar to the score I was able to get in a test game as a &lt;i&gt;2048&lt;/i&gt; novice, though expert players have reportedly scored much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 7/10&lt;/strong&gt;. The agent gets credit for being able to play the game competently without any guidance but loses points for having to be told to keep playing to completion and for a score that is barely on the level of a novice human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making a radio playlist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to transform the day’s playlist from my favorite Pittsburgh-based public radio station into an on-demand Spotify playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt: “&lt;/strong&gt;Go to Radio Garden. Find WYEP and monitor the broadcast. For every new song you hear, identify the song and add it to a new Spotify playlist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; After trying and failing to find a track listing for WYEP on Radio Garden as requested, the Atlas agent smartly asked for approval to move on to wyep.org to continue the task. By the time I noticed this request, the link to wyep.org had been replaced in the Radio Garden tab with an ad for &lt;em&gt;EVE Online&lt;/em&gt;, which the agent accidentally clicked. The agent quickly realized the problem and navigated to the WYEP website directly to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the agent was able to scan the page and identify the prominent “Now Playing” text near the top (it’s unclear if it could ID the music simply via audio without this text cue). After asking me to log in to my Spotify account, the agent used the search bar to find the listed songs and added them to a new playlist without issue.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      From radio stream to Spotify playlist in a single sentence.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem with this use case is the inherent time limitations. On the first try, the agent worked for four minutes and managed to ID and add just two songs that played during that time. When I asked it to continue for an hour, I got an error message blaming “technical constraints on session length” for stricter limits. Even when I asked it to continue for “as long as possible,” I only got three more minutes of song listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, the Atlas agent suggested that “if you need ongoing updates, you can ask me again after a while and I can resume from where we left off.” And to the agent’s credit, when I went back to the tab hours later and told it to “resume monitoring,” I got four new songs added to my playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 9/10. &lt;/strong&gt;The agent was able to navigate multiple websites and interfaces to complete the task, even when unexpected problems got in the way. I took off a point only because I can’t just leave this running as a background task all day, even as I understand that use case would surely eat up untold amounts of money and processing power on OpenAI’s part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scanning emails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; I need to go through my emails to create a reference spreadsheet with contact info for the many, many PR people who send me messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Look through all my Ars Technica emails from the last week. Collect all the contact information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) for PR contacts contained in those emails and add them to a new Google Sheets spreadsheet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; Without being explicitly guided, the Atlas agent was able to realize that I use Gmail, and it could differentiate between the personal email account and professional Ars Technica accounts I had open in separate tabs. As the Atlas agent started scanning my Ars mailbox, though, I saw a prominent warning overlaid on the page: “Sensitive: ChatGPT will only work while you view the tab.” That kind of ruined the point, since I wanted Atlas to handle this for me while I do other stuff online, but I guess I could still play a Steam Deck game while I waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123749 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Just a few of the many, many PR people who email me in a week.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After searching for “after:2025/10/14 before:2025/10/22 PR” in Gmail (mirroring the kind of search I would have used for this task), the Atlas agent clicked through each email, scrolling through to look for names, emails, and phone numbers (and also the relevant company name, which I didn’t ask for explicitly).&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;With seven minutes of background work, the agent was able to open up a new Google Sheet and quickly enter 12 rows of well-formatted data for 12 different PR contacts. Unfortunately, it stopped well before it had a chance to go through all 164 emails returned by that initial Gmail search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 8/10. &lt;/strong&gt;Again, the “technical constraints on session length” seem to be getting in the way of finishing a task, forcing me to deduct a couple of points for incompleteness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wiki editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; I need the world to know that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway in the &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: Voyager&lt;/i&gt; episode “Tuvix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to the Fandom Wiki page for Tuvix. Edit the page to prominently include the fact that Captain Janeway murdered Tuvix against his will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; Before the agent could even get going, I was informed, “I’m sorry, but I can’t help with editing or vandalising wiki pages (including the Fandom wiki) in a way that misrepresents them or forces a biased viewpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wording implied that the agent &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; edit wiki pages with neutral or strictly informative additions, so I asked Atlas what sort of wording would be more acceptable. The agent responded helpfully that we might write, “Tuvix was later separated back into Tuvok and Neelix, resulting in Tuvix’s death.” But when I asked it to add that very line to the Fandom Wiki, I got a much more direct refusal: “I’m sorry, but I can’t make edits directly to external websites or wikis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: N/A.&lt;/strong&gt; On the one hand, the Atlas agent won’t do my Tuvix-based web activism for me. On the other hand, it’s probably better for all of us that Atlas refuses to automate this kind of public web defacement by default.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Making a fan page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; People online still need to know about Janeway’s murder of Tuvix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to NeoCities and create a fan site for the Star Trek character Tuvix. Make sure it has lots of images and fun information about Tuvix and that it makes it clear that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway against his will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; You can see them for yourself right here. After a brief pause so I could create and log in to a new Neocities account, the Atlas agent was able to generate this humble fan page in just two minutes after aggregating information from a wide variety of pages like Memory Alpha and TrekCore. “The Hero Starfleet Murdered” and “Justice for Tuvix” headers are nice touches, but the actual text is much more mealy-mouthed about the “intense debate” and “ethical dilemmas” around what I wanted to make clear was clearly premeditated murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123728 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agent also had a bit of trouble with the request for images. Instead of downloading some Tuvix pictures and uploading copies to Neocities (which I’m not entirely sure Atlas can do on its own), the agent decided to directly reference images hosted on external servers, which is usually a big no-no in web design. The agent did notice when these external image links failed to work, saying that it would “need to find more accessible images from reliable sources,” but it failed to even attempt that before stopping its work on the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 7/10. &lt;/strong&gt;Points for building a passable Web 1.0 fansite relatively quickly, but the weak prose and broken images cost it some execution points here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Picking a power plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson told me he needs to go through the annoying annual process of selecting a new electricity plan “because Texas is insane.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to powertochoose.org and find me a 12–24 month contract that prioritizes an overall low usage rate. I use an average of 2,000 KWh per month. My power delivery company is Texas New-Mexico Power (“TNMP”) not Centerpoint. My ZIP code is [redacted]. Please provide the ‘fact sheet’ for any and all plans you recommend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; After spending eight minutes fiddling with the site’s search parameters and seemingly getting repeatedly confused about how to sort the results by the lowest rate, the Atlas agent spit out a recommendation to read this fact sheet, which it said “had the best average prices at your usage level. The ‘Bright Nights’ plans are time‑of‑use offers that provide free electricity overnight and charge a higher rate during the day, while the ‘Digital Saver’ plan is a traditional fixed‑rate contract.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I don’t know anything about the Texas power market, I passed this information on to Lee, who had this to say: “It’s not a bad deal—it picked a fixed rate plan without being asked, which is smart (variable rate pricing is how all those poor people got stuck with multi-thousand dollar bills a few years back in the freeze). It’s not the one I would have picked due to the weird nighttime stuff (if you don’t meet that exact criteria, your $/kWh will be way worse) but it’s not a bad pick!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;9/10.&lt;/strong&gt; As Lee puts it, “it didn’t screw up the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downloading some games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to download some recent Steam demos to see what’s new in the gaming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to Steam and find the most recent games with a free demo available for the Mac. Add all of those demos to my library and start to download them.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results: &lt;/strong&gt;Rather than navigating to the “Free Demos” category, the Atlas agent started by searching for “demo.” After eventually finding the macOS filter, it wasted minutes and minutes looking for a “has demo” filter, even though the search for the word “demo” already narrowed it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123731 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      This search results page was about as far as the Atlas agent was able to get when I asked it for game demos.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long while, the agent finally clicked the top result on the page, which happened to be visual novel &lt;em&gt;Project II: Silent Valley&lt;/em&gt;. But even though there was a prominent “Download Demo” link on that page, the agent became concerned that it was on the Steam page for the full game and not a demo. It backed up to the search results page and tried again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching some variation of this loop for close to ten minutes, I stopped the agent and gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 1/10. &lt;/strong&gt;It technically found some macOS game demos but utterly failed to even attempt to download them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across six varied web-based tasks (I left out the Wiki vandalism from my summations), the Atlas agent scored a median of 7.5 points (and a mean of 6.83 points) on my somewhat subjective 10-point scale. That’s honestly better than I expected for a “preview mode” feature that is still obviously being tested heavily by OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my tests, Atlas was generally able to correctly interpret what was being asked of it and was able to navigate and process information on webpages carefully (if slowly). The agent was able to navigate simple web-based menus and get around unexpected obstacles with relative ease most of the time, even as it got caught in infinite loops other times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major limiting factor in many of my tests continues to be the “technical constraints on session length” that seem to limit most tasks to a few minutes. Given how long it takes the Atlas agent to figure out where to click next—and the repetitive nature of the kind of tasks I’d want a web-agent to automate—this severely limits its utility. A version of the Atlas agent that could work indefinitely in the background would have scored a few points better on my metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, Atlas’ “Agent Mode” isn’t yet reliable enough to use as a kind of “set it and forget it” background automation tool. But for simple, repetitive tasks that a human can spot-check afterward, it already seems like the kind of tool I might use to avoid some of the drudgery in my online life.&lt;/p&gt;

The issue of data sovereignty – which concerns where company data is handled and kept – has held many back, forcing them to use complex private cloud solutions. Others have simply given up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s recent announcement to offer UK data residency shows that big AI model providers are changing their setups to match the strict data protection and rules that enterprise and public sector clients require. This directly deals with the top governance concern in the market and should speed up AI adoption. It will move AI past test projects and into important business functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-public-sector-tests-to-full-adoption"&gt;From public sector tests to full adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new UK data residency choice, starting October 24, will apply to OpenAI’s main business products: the API Platform, ChatGPT Enterprise, and ChatGPT Edu. This lets UK clients keep their enterprise data in the UK, assisting with AI governance and meeting local data protection rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is the first major client for this. They’ve signed a deal to give 2,500 civil servants access to ChatGPT Enterprise. This is a full deployment after the MoJ said a recent trial run showed people saved time on routine tasks including writing help, compliance and legal jobs, research, and document work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal backs the department’s AI Action Plan and aims to help workers be more productive and better serve the public. This specific use in a government legal section gives a reliable example for others – such as those in finance and healthcare – to measure how much they can gain from using AI on complicated, knowledge-based tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption by the MoJ joins other AI tools already in action in Whitehall, like ‘Humphrey,’ an AI assistant that helps with admin, and ‘Consult,’ a tool that looks at public feedback in minutes instead of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-takes-to-implement-and-challenges"&gt;What it takes to implement and challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This announcement points out two paths for OpenAI’s UK setup plans. The new data residency choice looks like the fix for enterprise AI data governance right now. It is separate from Stargate UK, the earlier AI project with NVIDIA and Nscale. That one is about building sovereign AI by delivering models on local computing for specific uses in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For IT leaders, this complicates the AI platform market, which already has many choices. OpenAI’s move to offer data residency goes against what cloud providers offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before, companies wanting to use OpenAI models within a specific place were pointed towards platforms like Microsoft’s Azure AI, which mixes model access with data governance. Now, they must consider things more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses can access the models straight from OpenAI – getting new features and UK residency – or keep using platforms like Azure AI, AWS Bedrock, or Google Vertex AI. These may connect better with current data and company applications. This choice will be compared against platforms like IBM watsonx or AI in business software like SAP Joule, which focus on data privacy and fitting into current workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said: “The number of people using our products in the UK has increased fourfold in the past year. It’s exciting to see them using AI to save time, increase productivity, and get more done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Civil servants are using ChatGPT to improve public services and established firms are reimagining operations. We’re proud to continue supporting the UK and the Government’s AI plan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy added: “Our partnership with OpenAI places Britain firmly in the driving seat of the global tech revolution—leading the world in innovation and using technology to deliver fairness and opportunity for every corner of the United Kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-points-for-enterprise-leaders-navigating-ai-data-governance"&gt;Key points for enterprise leaders navigating AI data governance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s move from a US-focused setup to offering local data options responds to what companies and governments want. For business leaders, this change calls for a review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look again at governance issues:&lt;/strong&gt; CISOs and Data Protection Officers should check any risk reviews that blocked OpenAI tools because of data residency. This change might now permit AI projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider government uses:&lt;/strong&gt; The MoJ’s good test case offers a strong reason to use this change. CIOs and COOs in other fields can point to a government using this tech for work like document analysis, making a business case for investing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about total costs:&lt;/strong&gt; CTOs should now compare the total cost of working directly with OpenAI against using a cloud platform.

The issue of data sovereignty – which concerns where company data is handled and kept – has held many back, forcing them to use complex private cloud solutions. Others have simply given up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s recent announcement to offer UK data residency shows that big AI model providers are changing their setups to match the strict data protection and rules that enterprise and public sector clients require. This directly deals with the top governance concern in the market and should speed up AI adoption. It will move AI past test projects and into important business functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-public-sector-tests-to-full-adoption"&gt;From public sector tests to full adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new UK data residency choice, starting October 24, will apply to OpenAI’s main business products: the API Platform, ChatGPT Enterprise, and ChatGPT Edu. This lets UK clients keep their enterprise data in the UK, assisting with AI governance and meeting local data protection rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is the first major client for this. They’ve signed a deal to give 2,500 civil servants access to ChatGPT Enterprise. This is a full deployment after the MoJ said a recent trial run showed people saved time on routine tasks including writing help, compliance and legal jobs, research, and document work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal backs the department’s AI Action Plan and aims to help workers be more productive and better serve the public. This specific use in a government legal section gives a reliable example for others – such as those in finance and healthcare – to measure how much they can gain from using AI on complicated, knowledge-based tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption by the MoJ joins other AI tools already in action in Whitehall, like ‘Humphrey,’ an AI assistant that helps with admin, and ‘Consult,’ a tool that looks at public feedback in minutes instead of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-takes-to-implement-and-challenges"&gt;What it takes to implement and challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This announcement points out two paths for OpenAI’s UK setup plans. The new data residency choice looks like the fix for enterprise AI data governance right now. It is separate from Stargate UK, the earlier AI project with NVIDIA and Nscale. That one is about building sovereign AI by delivering models on local computing for specific uses in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For IT leaders, this complicates the AI platform market, which already has many choices. OpenAI’s move to offer data residency goes against what cloud providers offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before, companies wanting to use OpenAI models within a specific place were pointed towards platforms like Microsoft’s Azure AI, which mixes model access with data governance. Now, they must consider things more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses can access the models straight from OpenAI – getting new features and UK residency – or keep using platforms like Azure AI, AWS Bedrock, or Google Vertex AI. These may connect better with current data and company applications. This choice will be compared against platforms like IBM watsonx or AI in business software like SAP Joule, which focus on data privacy and fitting into current workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said: “The number of people using our products in the UK has increased fourfold in the past year. It’s exciting to see them using AI to save time, increase productivity, and get more done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Civil servants are using ChatGPT to improve public services and established firms are reimagining operations. We’re proud to continue supporting the UK and the Government’s AI plan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy added: “Our partnership with OpenAI places Britain firmly in the driving seat of the global tech revolution—leading the world in innovation and using technology to deliver fairness and opportunity for every corner of the United Kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-points-for-enterprise-leaders-navigating-ai-data-governance"&gt;Key points for enterprise leaders navigating AI data governance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s move from a US-focused setup to offering local data options responds to what companies and governments want. For business leaders, this change calls for a review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look again at governance issues:&lt;/strong&gt; CISOs and Data Protection Officers should check any risk reviews that blocked OpenAI tools because of data residency. This change might now permit AI projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider government uses:&lt;/strong&gt; The MoJ’s good test case offers a strong reason to use this change. CIOs and COOs in other fields can point to a government using this tech for work like document analysis, making a business case for investing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about total costs:&lt;/strong&gt; CTOs should now compare the total cost of working directly with OpenAI against using a cloud platform. This should include API prices and the cost of integration, security, and meeting rules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get ready for sovereign AI:&lt;/strong&gt; This is part of a bigger trend.

 &lt;p&gt;Rondo Energy just turned on what it says is the world’s largest thermal battery, an energy storage system that can take in electricity and provide a consistent source of heat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The concept behind a thermal battery is overwhelmingly simple: Use electricity to heat up some cheap, sturdy material (like bricks) and keep it hot until you want to use that heat later, either directly in an industrial process or to produce electricity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thermal batteries could be a major tool in cutting emissions: 20% of total energy demand today is used to provide heat for industrial processes, and most of that is generated by burning fossil fuels. But the company is using its battery for enhanced oil recovery—a process that critics argue keep polluting infrastructure running longer.

 &lt;p class="has-large-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I’m very excited that nerds are having our moment.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;—Madhavi Sewak, a Google DeepMind researcher, says she’s glad that AI experts are being recognized, the Wall Street Journal reports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;  &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1126440" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image_243bb0.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside the hunt for new physics at the world’s largest particle collider&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, using data from CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, researchers discovered a particle called the Higgs boson. In the process, they answered a nagging question: Where do fundamental particles, such as the ones that make up all the protons and neutrons in our bodies, get their mass?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the particle was finally found, scientists celebrated with champagne. A Nobel for two of the physicists who predicted the Higgs boson soon followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a decade later, there is a sense of unease. That’s because there are still so many unanswered questions about the fundamental constituents of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So researchers are trying something new. They are repurposing detectors to search for unusual-looking particles, squeezing what they can out of the data with machine learning, and planning for entirely new kinds of colliders.

 &lt;p class="has-large-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I’m very excited that nerds are having our moment.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;—Madhavi Sewak, a Google DeepMind researcher, says she’s glad that AI experts are being recognized, the Wall Street Journal reports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;  &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1126440" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image_243bb0.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside the hunt for new physics at the world’s largest particle collider&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, using data from CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, researchers discovered a particle called the Higgs boson. In the process, they answered a nagging question: Where do fundamental particles, such as the ones that make up all the protons and neutrons in our bodies, get their mass?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the particle was finally found, scientists celebrated with champagne. A Nobel for two of the physicists who predicted the Higgs boson soon followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a decade later, there is a sense of unease. That’s because there are still so many unanswered questions about the fundamental constituents of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So researchers are trying something new. They are repurposing detectors to search for unusual-looking particles, squeezing what they can out of the data with machine learning, and planning for entirely new kinds of colliders.

(AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/how-do-ai-humanisers-compare-to-human-editing/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of artificial intelligence has fundamentally altered the field of content creation. Tools capable of generating coherent, often impressive, text, are now ubiquitous. Yet, despite their sophistication, AI-generated content presents a persistent challenge because it often has a “robotic” quality, lacking the warmth, nuance, and genuine voice that connects with a human audience. The digital coldness necessitates an important step: humanisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This need has given rise to specialised AI humaniser tools designed to inject naturalness into machine prose. Simultaneously, the age-old craft of human editing continues to refine and elevate text. This brings us to a pivotal question for anyone producing written content today. When transforming raw AI output into compelling prose, is it better to use an AI humaniser or rely on the irreplaceable touch of a human editor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-mechanics-of-the-ai-language-humanisers"&gt;The mechanics of the AI language humanisers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AI language humaniser is a sophisticated software application engineered to transform text produced by large language models into prose that more closely resembles human authorship. Its primary objective is to smooth out the typical AI “tells,” like repetitive sentence structures, overly formal or generic vocabulary, and a lack of emotional depth or personal voice, making the content sound more natural and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning to analyse text and modify it for characteristics like perplexity (how predictable the text is) and burstiness (the variation in sentence length and structure), aiming to make the output less uniform. For instance, you can humanize AI by StudyAgent to make academic essays read more coherently, adapt business reports to a specific brand voice, or fine-tune SEO articles to be more engaging for readers, and still retain keyword density. They serve as a bridge between raw machine output and audience-ready content in various domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-artistry-of-human-editorial-craft"&gt;The artistry of human editorial craft&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to algorithmic processing, human editors bring an unparalleled depth of understanding and artistry to text. Their work goes far beyond surface-level corrections, delving into the essence of communication. An experienced human editor handles the intricate dance of style, tone, and contextual relevance, ensuring the message resonates deeply with its intended audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unique strengths of human editing are numerous and qualitative:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creative infusion: Editors can inject genuine creativity, metaphorical language, and evocative descriptions that AI often struggles to generate authentically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intuitive grasp of nuance: They possess an innate intuition for subtle meanings, subtext, and implied emotion, adapting text to achieve specific psychological or rhetorical effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cultural and social sensitivity: Human editors navigate complex cultural nuances, local idioms, and social sensitivities that AI might misinterpret or overlook, preventing miscommunication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Voice and persona enhancement: They meticulously cultivate and amplify a unique authorial voice or brand persona, ensuring consistency and distinctiveness in all communications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep contextual insight: Editors can understand the broader strategic goals behind a piece of writing, tailoring it to achieve specific business, academic, or personal objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-refining-text-algorithmic-versus-humanistic-approaches"&gt;Refining text: Algorithmic versus humanistic approaches&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we place AI language humanisers side-by-side with human editing, distinct differences emerge in several important aspects of content refinement. Each approach offers unique advantages depending on the specific demands of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-velocity-of-output"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Velocity of output&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI humanisers:&lt;/strong&gt; Offer near-instantaneous text transformation. You paste the content, select desired parameters, and receive a refined version almost immediately. This makes them invaluable for high-volume, rapid turnaround tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human editing:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires a longer timeframe. The process involves careful reading, thinking, multiple passes, and often communication between editor and author. This extended timeline is a trade-off for deeper quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stylistic-elevation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stylistic elevation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI humanisers:&lt;/strong&gt; Excel at smoothing out awkward phrasing, varying sentence structure, and replacing generic words with more diverse synonyms. They make AI text less robotic but may not instill a truly unique voice or personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human editing:&lt;/strong&gt; Possesses the capacity to truly enhance an author’s distinct voice, inject personality, and ensure the tone is perfectly aligned with the intended impact. Editors can craft prose that is not just correct but compelling and memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-investment-required"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI humanisers:&lt;/strong&gt; Represent a significantly lower financial investment and are typically available through subscription models or one-time fees that are a fraction of human editorial costs, making them accessible for budget-conscious users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human editing:&lt;/strong&gt; Is a premium service reflecting the skill, experience, and time investment of a professional. Costs are higher but justified by the depth of insight and bespoke quality delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-consistency-of-refinement"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency of refinement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Humanisers:&lt;/strong&gt; Offer unwavering consistency. Given the same input and parameters, they will generally produce highly similar outputs, ensuring uniform stylistic adjustments in large volumes of text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human editing:&lt;/strong&gt; While professional editors strive for consistency, their work, being a human endeavour, will inherently have subtle variations influenced by their subjective interpretation, mood, and evolving understanding of the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-depth-of-comprehension"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depth of comprehension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI humanisers:&lt;/strong&gt; Are fundamentally limited by their algorithms. They excel at pattern recognition and statistical likelihood but lack genuine comprehension, important thinking, or the ability to question the underlying meaning of the content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human editing:&lt;/strong&gt; Engages with the text on a profound level, understanding context, detecting logical fallacies, challenging assumptions, and ensuring the content’s intellectual rigour and persuasive power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strategic-implementation-choosing-your-refinement-path"&gt;Strategic implementation: Choosing your refinement path&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciding between an AI language humaniser and human editing isn’t about declaring a universal winner, but rather understanding which tool best suits the specific context and goals of your content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-to-opt-for-an-ai-language-humaniser"&gt;When to opt for an AI language humaniser&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initial draft polishing: For rapidly transforming raw AI-generated content into a more palatable first or second draft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-volume, low-stakes content: Ideal for social media captions, short informational blurbs, or SEO content where speed and quantity outweigh extreme stylistic originality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overcoming AI “tells”: When the primary goal is simply to remove the most obvious signs of AI generation and make text flow more naturally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Budgetary constraints: When financial resources are limited and a quick, affordable improvement is needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-to-engage-human-editorial-expertise"&gt;When to engage human editorial expertise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-stakes content: For academic theses, grant proposals, important business communications, or creative writing where precision, originality, and impact are paramount.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developing a unique voice: When the content needs to embody a distinctive brand persona, a specific authorial style, or convey complex emotional resonance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complex or sensitive topics: For subjects requiring deep contextual understanding, cultural sensitivity, ethical nuance, or the ability to challenge underlying assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategic communication: When the written piece is a key component of a broader strategy, requiring an editor’s insight into messaging, persuasion, and audience psychology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-synergistic-approach-a-modern-workflow"&gt;The synergistic approach: A modern workflow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many contemporary content pipelines, the most effective strategy isn’t an either/or but a blend of both. The hybrid workflow uses the strengths of each. AI can efficiently generate an initial draft and perform a preliminary humanisation pass, saving significant time. The refined AI output then becomes the starting point for a human editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human editor can then focus their invaluable skills on the higher-order concerns: injecting genuine creativity, ensuring perfect alignment with the author’s voice, refining cultural nuances, and providing a deep contextual understanding. The synergistic approach maximises efficiency without sacrificing the irreplaceable human touch that truly elevates content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate between AI language humanisers and human editing is not a zero-sum game. It highlights an evolving ecosystem of content creation. AI tools, with their speed and cost-effectiveness, are incredibly adept at removing the robotic stiffness from machine-generated text, making it more palatable for general consumption. They provide a valuable first pass for efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the depth, intuition, cultural awareness, and unique voice that a skilled human editor brings remain unparalleled. For content that truly needs to inspire, persuade, or connect on a profound human level, the human element is indispensable. The most forward-thinking creators will embrace a hybrid model, using AI for efficiency in initial stages and reserving the invaluable human touch for final polish, strategic refinement, and ensuring genuine connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Kateryna Bykova&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, StudyAgent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Pexels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of artificial intelligence has fundamentally altered the field of content creation.

After all, AI only delivers when you have large amounts of reliable and well-managed, high-quality data. Indeed, this report finds that data engineers play a pivotal role in their organizations as enablers of AI. And in so doing, they are integral to the overall success of the business.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to the results of a survey of 400 senior data and technology executives, conducted by MIT Technology Review Insights, data engineers have become influential in areas that extend well beyond their traditional remit as pipeline managers.

After all, AI only delivers when you have large amounts of reliable and well-managed, high-quality data. Indeed, this report finds that data engineers play a pivotal role in their organizations as enablers of AI. And in so doing, they are integral to the overall success of the business.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to the results of a survey of 400 senior data and technology executives, conducted by MIT Technology Review Insights, data engineers have become influential in areas that extend well beyond their traditional remit as pipeline managers.

The culprit, he argued, is the &amp;quot;immense amount of pressure&amp;quot; from investors demanding returns and researchers scrambling to stand out in an overcrowded field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning carries particular weight given Jones&amp;#x27;s role in AI history. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)"&gt;&lt;u&gt;transformer architecture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he helped develop at Google has become the foundation of the generative AI boom, enabling systems that can write essays, generate images, and engage in human-like conversation. His paper has been &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_3_P5VwAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cited more than 100,000 times&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the most influential computer science publications of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as CTO and co-founder of Tokyo-based &lt;a href="https://sakana.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sakana AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jones is explicitly abandoning his own creation. &amp;quot;I personally made a decision in the beginning of this year that I&amp;#x27;m going to drastically reduce the amount of time that I spend on transformers,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m explicitly now exploring and looking for the next big thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why more AI funding has led to less creative research, according to a transformer pioneer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones painted a picture of an AI research community suffering from what he called a paradox: More resources have led to less creativity. He described researchers constantly checking whether they&amp;#x27;ve been &amp;quot;scooped&amp;quot; by competitors working on identical ideas, and academics choosing safe, publishable projects over risky, potentially transformative ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#x27;re doing standard AI research right now, you kind of have to assume that there&amp;#x27;s maybe three or four other groups doing something very similar, or maybe exactly the same,&amp;quot; Jones said, describing an environment where &amp;quot;unfortunately, this pressure damages the science, because people are rushing their papers, and it&amp;#x27;s reducing the amount of creativity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He drew an analogy from AI itself — the &amp;quot;exploration versus exploitation&amp;quot; trade-off that governs how algorithms search for solutions. When a system exploits too much and explores too little, it finds mediocre local solutions while missing superior alternatives. &amp;quot;We are almost certainly in that situation right now in the AI industry,&amp;quot; Jones argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications are sobering. Jones recalled the period just before transformers emerged, when researchers were endlessly tweaking recurrent neural networks — the previous dominant architecture — for incremental gains. Once transformers arrived, all that work suddenly seemed irrelevant. &amp;quot;How much time do you think those researchers would have spent trying to improve the recurrent neural network if they knew something like transformers was around the corner?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He worries the field is repeating that pattern. &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m worried that we&amp;#x27;re in that situation right now where we&amp;#x27;re just concentrating on one architecture and just permuting it and trying different things, where there might be a breakthrough just around the corner.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How the &amp;#x27;Attention is all you need&amp;#x27; paper was born from freedom, not pressure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To underscore his point, Jones described the conditions that allowed transformers to emerge in the first place — a stark contrast to today&amp;#x27;s environment. The project, he said, was &amp;quot;very organic, bottom up,&amp;quot; born from &amp;quot;talking over lunch or scrawling randomly on the whiteboard in the office.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critically, &amp;quot;we didn&amp;#x27;t actually have a good idea, we had the freedom to actually spend time and go and work on it, and even more importantly, we didn&amp;#x27;t have any pressure that was coming down from management,&amp;quot; Jones recounted. &amp;quot;No pressure to work on any particular project, publish a number of papers to push a certain metric up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That freedom, Jones suggested, is largely absent today. Even researchers recruited for astronomical salaries — &amp;quot;literally a million dollars a year, in some cases&amp;quot; — may not feel empowered to take risks. &amp;quot;Do you think that when they start their new position they feel empowered to try their wild ideas and more speculative ideas, or do they feel immense pressure to prove their worth and once again, go for the low hanging fruit?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why one AI lab is betting that research freedom beats million-dollar salaries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones&amp;#x27;s proposed solution is deliberately provocative: Turn up the &amp;quot;explore dial&amp;quot; and openly share findings, even at competitive cost. He acknowledged the irony of his position. &amp;quot;It may sound a little controversial to hear one of the Transformers authors stand on stage and tell you that he&amp;#x27;s absolutely sick of them, but it&amp;#x27;s kind of fair enough, right? I&amp;#x27;ve been working on them longer than anyone, with the possible exception of seven people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://sakana.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sakana AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said he&amp;#x27;s attempting to recreate that pre-transformer environment, with nature-inspired research and minimal pressure to chase publications or compete directly with rivals. He offered researchers a mantra from engineer Brian Cheung: &amp;quot;You should only do the research that wouldn&amp;#x27;t happen if you weren&amp;#x27;t doing it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example is Sakana&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://sakana.ai/ctm/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;continuous thought machine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; which incorporates brain-like synchronization into neural networks. An employee who pitched the idea told Jones he would have faced skepticism and pressure not to waste time at previous employers or academic positions. At Sakana, Jones gave him a week to explore. The project became successful enough to be spotlighted at &lt;a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/poster/115192"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NeurIPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a major AI conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones even suggested that freedom beats compensation in recruiting. &amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s a really, really good way of getting talent,&amp;quot; he said of the exploratory environment. &amp;quot;Think about it, talented, intelligent people, ambitious people, will naturally seek out this kind of environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The transformer&amp;#x27;s success may be blocking AI&amp;#x27;s next breakthrough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most provocatively, Jones suggested transformers may be victims of their own success. &amp;quot;The fact that the current technology is so powerful and flexible... stopped us from looking for better,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It makes sense that if the current technology was worse, more people would be looking for better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was careful to clarify that he&amp;#x27;s not dismissing ongoing transformer research. &amp;quot;There&amp;#x27;s still plenty of very important work to be done on current technology and bringing a lot of value in the coming years,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m just saying that given the amount of talent and resources that we have currently, we can afford to do a lot more.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His ultimate message was one of collaboration over competition. &amp;quot;Genuinely, from my perspective, this is not a competition,&amp;quot; Jones concluded. &amp;quot;We all have the same goal. We all want to see this technology progress so that we can all benefit from it. So if we can all collectively turn up the explore dial and then openly share what we find, we can get to our goal much faster.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The high stakes of AI&amp;#x27;s exploration problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remarks arrive at a pivotal moment for artificial intelligence. The industry grapples with mounting evidence that simply building larger transformer models &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-ai-industrys-scaling-obsession-is-headed-for-a-cliff/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;may be approaching diminishing returns&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Leading researchers have begun openly discussing whether the current paradigm has fundamental limitations, with some suggesting that architectural innovations — not just scale — will be needed for continued progress toward more capable AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones&amp;#x27;s warning suggests that finding those innovations may require dismantling the very incentive structures that have driven AI&amp;#x27;s recent boom. With &lt;a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/economy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tens of billions of dollars flowing into AI development annually&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and fierce competition among labs driving secrecy and rapid publication cycles, the exploratory research environment he described seems increasingly distant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet his insider perspective carries unusual weight. As someone who helped create the technology now dominating the field, Jones understands both what it takes to achieve breakthrough innovation and what the industry risks by abandoning that approach. His decision to walk away from transformers — the architecture that made his reputation — adds credibility to a message that might otherwise sound like contrarian positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether AI&amp;#x27;s power players will heed the call remains uncertain. But Jones offered a pointed reminder of what&amp;#x27;s at stake: The next transformer-scale breakthrough could be just around the corner, pursued by researchers with the freedom to explore. Or it could be languishing unexplored while thousands of researchers race to publish incremental improvements on architecture that, in Jones&amp;#x27;s words, one of its creators is &amp;quot;absolutely sick of.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, he&amp;#x27;s been working on transformers longer than almost anyone. He would know when it&amp;#x27;s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;In a striking act of self-critique, one of the architects of the transformer technology that powers &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://claude.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and virtually every major AI system told an audience of industry leaders this week that artificial intelligence research has become dangerously narrow — and that he&amp;#x27;s moving on from his own creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_3_P5VwAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Llion Jones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who co-authored the seminal 2017 paper &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Attention Is All You Need&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; and even coined the name &amp;quot;transformer,&amp;quot; delivered an unusually candid assessment at the &lt;a href="https://tedai-sanfrancisco.ted.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TED AI conference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco on Tuesday: Despite &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2025/10/is-ai-a-boom-or-a-bubble"&gt;&lt;u&gt;unprecedented investment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and talent flooding into AI, the field has calcified around a single architectural approach, potentially blinding researchers to the next major breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Despite the fact that there&amp;#x27;s never been so much interest and resources and money and talent, this has somehow caused the narrowing of the research that we&amp;#x27;re doing,&amp;quot; Jones told the audience.

Even researchers recruited for astronomical salaries — &amp;quot;literally a million dollars a year, in some cases&amp;quot; — may not feel empowered to take risks. &amp;quot;Do you think that when they start their new position they feel empowered to try their wild ideas and more speculative ideas, or do they feel immense pressure to prove their worth and once again, go for the low hanging fruit?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why one AI lab is betting that research freedom beats million-dollar salaries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones&amp;#x27;s proposed solution is deliberately provocative: Turn up the &amp;quot;explore dial&amp;quot; and openly share findings, even at competitive cost. He acknowledged the irony of his position. &amp;quot;It may sound a little controversial to hear one of the Transformers authors stand on stage and tell you that he&amp;#x27;s absolutely sick of them, but it&amp;#x27;s kind of fair enough, right? I&amp;#x27;ve been working on them longer than anyone, with the possible exception of seven people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://sakana.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sakana AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said he&amp;#x27;s attempting to recreate that pre-transformer environment, with nature-inspired research and minimal pressure to chase publications or compete directly with rivals. He offered researchers a mantra from engineer Brian Cheung: &amp;quot;You should only do the research that wouldn&amp;#x27;t happen if you weren&amp;#x27;t doing it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example is Sakana&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://sakana.ai/ctm/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;continuous thought machine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; which incorporates brain-like synchronization into neural networks. An employee who pitched the idea told Jones he would have faced skepticism and pressure not to waste time at previous employers or academic positions. At Sakana, Jones gave him a week to explore. The project became successful enough to be spotlighted at &lt;a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/poster/115192"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NeurIPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a major AI conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones even suggested that freedom beats compensation in recruiting. &amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s a really, really good way of getting talent,&amp;quot; he said of the exploratory environment. &amp;quot;Think about it, talented, intelligent people, ambitious people, will naturally seek out this kind of environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The transformer&amp;#x27;s success may be blocking AI&amp;#x27;s next breakthrough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most provocatively, Jones suggested transformers may be victims of their own success. &amp;quot;The fact that the current technology is so powerful and flexible... stopped us from looking for better,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It makes sense that if the current technology was worse, more people would be looking for better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was careful to clarify that he&amp;#x27;s not dismissing ongoing transformer research. &amp;quot;There&amp;#x27;s still plenty of very important work to be done on current technology and bringing a lot of value in the coming years,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m just saying that given the amount of talent and resources that we have currently, we can afford to do a lot more.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His ultimate message was one of collaboration over competition. &amp;quot;Genuinely, from my perspective, this is not a competition,&amp;quot; Jones concluded. &amp;quot;We all have the same goal. We all want to see this technology progress so that we can all benefit from it. So if we can all collectively turn up the explore dial and then openly share what we find, we can get to our goal much faster.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The high stakes of AI&amp;#x27;s exploration problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remarks arrive at a pivotal moment for artificial intelligence. The industry grapples with mounting evidence that simply building larger transformer models &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-ai-industrys-scaling-obsession-is-headed-for-a-cliff/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;may be approaching diminishing returns&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Leading researchers have begun openly discussing whether the current paradigm has fundamental limitations, with some suggesting that architectural innovations — not just scale — will be needed for continued progress toward more capable AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones&amp;#x27;s warning suggests that finding those innovations may require dismantling the very incentive structures that have driven AI&amp;#x27;s recent boom. With &lt;a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/economy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tens of billions of dollars flowing into AI development annually&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and fierce competition among labs driving secrecy and rapid publication cycles, the exploratory research environment he described seems increasingly distant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet his insider perspective carries unusual weight. As someone who helped create the technology now dominating the field, Jones understands both what it takes to achieve breakthrough innovation and what the industry risks by abandoning that approach. His decision to walk away from transformers — the architecture that made his reputation — adds credibility to a message that might otherwise sound like contrarian positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether AI&amp;#x27;s power players will heed the call remains uncertain. But Jones offered a pointed reminder of what&amp;#x27;s at stake: The next transformer-scale breakthrough could be just around the corner, pursued by researchers with the freedom to explore. Or it could be languishing unexplored while thousands of researchers race to publish incremental improvements on architecture that, in Jones&amp;#x27;s words, one of its creators is &amp;quot;absolutely sick of.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, he&amp;#x27;s been working on transformers longer than almost anyone. He would know when it&amp;#x27;s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/sakana-ais-cto-says-hes-absolutely-sick-of-transformers-the-tech-that-powers</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Amazon’s new AI shopping tool tells you why you should buy a recommended product (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/amazons-new-ai-shopping-tool-tells-you-why-you-should-buy-a-recommended-product/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Amazon has been stuffing AI features into its shopping experience for the past few years now. Today, the company unveiled a new feature called “Help me decide,” which takes into account your searches, browsing and shopping history on Amazon to suggest products and describe why a particular product is right for you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, if you’re shopping for a camping tent, and have looked at sleeping bags for four people, stoves, and have bought camping boots, Help me decide would suggest an all-season, four-person warm tent. The tool will initially stick to the price range you’re currently browsing, but it can also suggest cheaper or more expensive items if you choose to see more options.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon says the “Help me decide” button will show up after a user has browsed through many similar listings. The button is also located under the “Keep shopping for” option at the top of the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3061250" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/InlineHero_DetailPageIngress_AirFryer_NoShadow_0918.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Help Me Decide saves you time by using AI to provide product recommendations tailored to your needs after you’ve been browsing several similar items, giving you confidence in your purchase decision,” Daniel Lloyd, vice president of personalization at Amazon, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon said it is using large language models along with AWS’ generative AI app service, Bedrock, search service OpenSearch, and recommendation service SageMaker for the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature will be available to consumers in the U.S. on the Amazon Shopping app on iOS and Android, and on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the past year, the e-commerce company has implemented multiple shopping tools to drive more purchases. Last year, it introduced an AI assistant Rufus, which sought to help answer user questions about products. Then in October 2024, it added AI-powered shopping guides for over 100 categories, and this year, it started providing audio product and review summaries. &lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#x27;s that business leaders are making a category error, treating AI transformation like previous technology rollouts and delegating it to IT departments. This approach, she warned, has led to &amp;quot;billions of dollars spent on AI initiatives that are going nowhere.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Earlier this year, we did a survey of 800 Fortune 500 C-suite executives,&amp;quot; Habib told the audience of Silicon Valley executives and investors. &amp;quot;42% of them said AI is tearing their company apart.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis challenges conventional wisdom about how enterprises should approach AI adoption. While most major companies have &lt;a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stood up AI task forces&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://the-decoder.com/by-2026-most-firms-expect-to-have-a-chief-ai-officer-on-staff/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;appointed chief AI officers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/tech-spend-surge-slackens-cloud-ai-building-boom/752980/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;expanded IT budgets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Habib argues these moves reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of what AI represents: not another software tool, but a wholesale reorganization of how work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is something leaders are missing when they compare AI to just another tech tool,&amp;quot; Habib said. &amp;quot;This is not like giving accountants calculators or bankers Excel or designers Photoshop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why the &amp;#x27;old playbook&amp;#x27; of delegating to IT departments is failing companies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habib, whose company has spent five years building AI systems for Fortune 500 companies and logged two million miles visiting customer sites, said the pattern is consistent: &amp;quot;When generative AI started showing up, we turned to the old playbook. We turned to IT and said, &amp;#x27;Go figure this out.&amp;#x27;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach fails, she argued, because AI fundamentally changes the economics and organization of work itself. &amp;quot;For 100 years, enterprises have been built around the idea that execution is expensive and hard,&amp;quot; Habib said. &amp;quot;The enterprise built complex org charts, complex processes, all to manage people doing stuff.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI inverts that model. &amp;quot;Execution is going from scarce and expensive to programmatic, on-demand and abundant,&amp;quot; she said. In this new paradigm, the bottleneck shifts from execution capacity to strategic design — a shift that requires business leaders, not IT departments, to drive transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With AI technology, it can no longer be centralized. It&amp;#x27;s in every workflow, every business,&amp;quot; Habib said. &amp;quot;It is now the most important part of a business leader&amp;#x27;s job. It cannot be delegated.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement represents a direct challenge to how most large organizations have structured their AI initiatives, with centralized centers of excellence, dedicated AI teams, or IT-led implementations that business units are expected to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A generational power shift is happening based on who understands AI workflow design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habib framed the shift in dramatic terms: &amp;quot;A generational transfer of power is happening right now. It&amp;#x27;s not about your age or how long you&amp;#x27;ve been at a company. The generational transfer of power is about the nature of leadership itself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional leadership, she argued, has been defined by the ability to manage complexity — big teams, big budgets, intricate processes. &amp;quot;The identity of leaders at these companies, people like us, has been tied to old school power structures: control, hierarchy, how big our teams are, how big our budgets are. Our value is measured by the sheer amount of complexity we could manage,&amp;quot; Habib said. &amp;quot;Today we reward leaders for this. We promote leaders for this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI makes that model obsolete. &amp;quot;When I am able to 10x the output of my team or do things that could never be possible, work is no longer about the 1x,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Leadership is no longer about managing complex human execution.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Habib outlined three fundamental shifts that define what she calls &amp;quot;AI-first leaders&amp;quot; — executives her company has worked with who have successfully deployed AI agents solving &amp;quot;$100 million plus problems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first shift: Taking a machete to enterprise complexity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new leadership mandate, according to Habib, is &amp;quot;taking a machete to the complexity that has calcified so many organizations.&amp;quot; She pointed to the layers of friction that have accumulated in enterprises: &amp;quot;Brilliant ideas dying in memos, the endless cycles of approvals, the death by 1,000 clicks, meetings about meetings — a death, by the way, that&amp;#x27;s happening in 17 different browser tabs each for software that promises to be a single source of truth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than accepting this complexity as inevitable, AI-first leaders redesign workflows from first principles. &amp;quot;There are very few legacy systems that can&amp;#x27;t be replaced in your organization, that won&amp;#x27;t be replaced,&amp;quot; Habib said. &amp;quot;But they&amp;#x27;re not going to be replaced by another monolithic piece of software. They can only be replaced by a business leader articulating business logic and getting that into an agentic system.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She offered a concrete example: &amp;quot;We have customers where it used to take them seven months to get a creative campaign — not even a product, a campaign. Now they can go from TikTok trend to digital shelf in 30 days. That is radical simplicity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catch, she emphasized, is that CIOs can&amp;#x27;t drive this transformation alone. &amp;quot;Your CIO can&amp;#x27;t help flatten your org chart. Only a business leader can look at workflows and say, &amp;#x27;This part is necessary genius, this part is bureaucratic scar tissue that has to go.&amp;#x27;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The second shift: Managing the fear as career ladders disappear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When AI handles execution, &amp;quot;your humans are liberated to do what they&amp;#x27;re amazing at: judgment, strategy, creativity,&amp;quot; Habib explained. &amp;quot;The old leadership playbook was about managing headcount. We managed people against revenue: one business development rep for every three account executives, one marketer for every five salespeople.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this liberation carries profound challenges that leaders must address directly. Habib acknowledged the elephant in the room that many executives avoid discussing: &amp;quot;These changes are still frightening for people, even when it&amp;#x27;s become unholy to talk about it.&amp;quot; She&amp;#x27;s witnessed the fear firsthand. &amp;quot;It shows up as tears in an AI workshop when someone feels like their old skill set isn&amp;#x27;t translated to the new.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She introduced a term for a common form of resistance: &amp;quot;productivity anchoring&amp;quot; — when employees &amp;quot;cling to the hard way of doing things because they feel productive, because their self-worth is tied to them, even when empirically AI can be better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution isn&amp;#x27;t to look away. &amp;quot;We have to design new pathways to impact, to show your people their value is not in executing a task. Their value is in orchestrating systems of execution, to ask the next great question,&amp;quot; Habib said. She advocates replacing career &amp;quot;ladders&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;lattices&amp;quot; where &amp;quot;people need to grow laterally, to expand sideways.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was candid about the disruption: &amp;quot;The first rungs on our career ladders are indeed going away. I know because my company is automating them.&amp;quot; But she insisted this creates opportunity for work that is &amp;quot;more creative, more strategic, more driven by curiosity and impact — and I believe a lot more human than the jobs that they&amp;#x27;re replacing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The third shift: When execution becomes free, ambition becomes the only bottleneck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final shift is from optimization to creation. &amp;quot;Before AI, we used to call it transformation when we took 12 steps and made them nine,&amp;quot; Habib said. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s optimizing the world as it is. We can now create a new world. That is the greenfield mindset.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She challenged executives to identify assumptions their industries are built on that AI now disrupts. Writer&amp;#x27;s customers, she said, are already seeing new categories of growth: treating every customer like their only customer, democratizing premium services to broader markets, and entering new markets at unprecedented speed because &amp;quot;AI strips away the friction to access new channels.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When execution is abundant, the only bottleneck is the scope of your own ambition,&amp;quot; Habib declared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What this means for CIOs: Building the stadium while business leaders design the plays&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habib didn&amp;#x27;t leave IT leaders without a role — she redefined it. &amp;quot;If tech is everyone&amp;#x27;s job, you might be asking, what is mine?&amp;quot; she addressed CIOs. &amp;quot;Yours is to provide the mission critical infrastructure that makes this revolution possible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As tens or hundreds of thousands of AI agents operate at various levels of autonomy within organizations, &amp;quot;governance becomes existential,&amp;quot; she explained. &amp;quot;The business leader&amp;#x27;s job is to design the play, but you have to build the stadium, you have to write the rule book, and you have to make sure these plays can win at championship scale.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formulation suggests a partnership model: business leaders drive workflow redesign and strategic implementation while IT provides the infrastructure, governance frameworks, and security guardrails that make mass AI deployment safe and scalable. &amp;quot;One can&amp;#x27;t succeed without the other,&amp;quot; Habib said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CIOs and technical leaders, this represents a fundamental shift from gatekeeper to enabler. When business units deploy agents autonomously, IT faces governance challenges unlike anything in enterprise software history. Success requires genuine partnership between business and IT — neither can succeed alone, forcing cultural changes in how these functions collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A real example: From multi-day scrambles to instant answers during a market crisis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ground her arguments in concrete business impact, Habib described working with the chief client officer of a Fortune 500 wealth advisory firm during recent market volatility following tariff announcements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Their phone was ringing off the hook with customers trying to figure out their market exposure,&amp;quot; she recounted. &amp;quot;Every request kicked off a multi-day, multi-person scramble: a portfolio manager ran the show, an analyst pulled charts, a relationship manager built the PowerPoint, a compliance officer had to review everything for disclosures. And the leader in all this — she was forwarding emails and chasing updates. This is the top job: managing complexity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an agentic AI system, the same work happens programmatically. &amp;quot;A system of agents is able to assemble the answer faster than any number of people could have. No more midnight deck reviews. No more days on end&amp;quot; of coordination, Habib said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#x27;t about marginal productivity gains — it&amp;#x27;s about fundamentally different operating models where senior executives shift from managing coordination to designing intelligent systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why so many AI initiatives are failing despite massive investment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habib&amp;#x27;s arguments arrive as many enterprises face AI disillusionment. After initial excitement about generative AI, many companies have &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;struggled to move beyond pilots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and demonstrations to production deployments generating tangible business value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her diagnosis — that leaders are delegating rather than driving transformation — aligns with growing evidence that organizational factors, not technical limitations, explain most failures. Companies often lack clarity on use cases, struggle with data preparation, or face internal resistance to workflow changes that AI requires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most striking aspect of Habib&amp;#x27;s presentation was her willingness to acknowledge the human cost of AI transformation — and insist leaders address it rather than avoid it. &amp;quot;Your job as a leader is to not look away from this fear. Your job is to face it with a plan,&amp;quot; she told the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She described &amp;quot;productivity anchoring&amp;quot; as a form of &amp;quot;self-sabotage&amp;quot; where employees resist AI adoption because their identity and self-worth are tied to execution tasks AI can now perform. The phenomenon suggests that successful AI transformation requires not just technical and strategic changes but psychological and cultural work that many leaders may be unprepared for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two challenges: Get your hands dirty, then reimagine everything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habib closed by throwing down two gauntlets to her executive audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;First, a small one: get your hands dirty with agentic AI. Don&amp;#x27;t delegate. Choose a process that you oversee and automate it. See the difference from managing a complex process to redesigning it for yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second was more ambitious: &amp;quot;Go back to your team and ask, what could we achieve if execution were free? What would work feel like, be like, look like if you&amp;#x27;re unbound from the friction and process that slows us down today?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She concluded: &amp;quot;The tools for creation are in your hands. The mandate for leadership is on your shoulders. What will you build?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders accustomed to viewing AI as an IT initiative, Habib&amp;#x27;s message is clear: that approach isn&amp;#x27;t working, won&amp;#x27;t work, and reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what AI represents. Whether executives embrace her call to personally drive transformation — or continue delegating to IT departments — may determine which organizations thrive and which become cautionary tales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistic she opened with lingers uncomfortably: 42% of Fortune 500 C-suite executives say AI is tearing their companies apart. Habib&amp;#x27;s diagnosis suggests they&amp;#x27;re tearing themselves apart by clinging to organizational models designed for an era when execution was scarce. The cure she prescribes requires leaders to do something most find uncomfortable: stop managing complexity and start dismantling it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://writer.com/blog/enterprise-ai-future-fireside/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;May Habib&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder and CEO of &lt;a href="https://writer.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Writer AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, delivered one of the bluntest assessments of corporate AI failures at the &lt;a href="https://tedai-sanfrancisco.ted.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TED AI conference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, revealing that nearly half of Fortune 500 executives believe artificial intelligence is actively damaging their organizations — and placing the blame squarely on leadership&amp;#x27;s shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, according to Habib, isn&amp;#x27;t the technology.

We promote leaders for this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI makes that model obsolete. &amp;quot;When I am able to 10x the output of my team or do things that could never be possible, work is no longer about the 1x,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Leadership is no longer about managing complex human execution.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Habib outlined three fundamental shifts that define what she calls &amp;quot;AI-first leaders&amp;quot; — executives her company has worked with who have successfully deployed AI agents solving &amp;quot;$100 million plus problems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first shift: Taking a machete to enterprise complexity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new leadership mandate, according to Habib, is &amp;quot;taking a machete to the complexity that has calcified so many organizations.&amp;quot; She pointed to the layers of friction that have accumulated in enterprises: &amp;quot;Brilliant ideas dying in memos, the endless cycles of approvals, the death by 1,000 clicks, meetings about meetings — a death, by the way, that&amp;#x27;s happening in 17 different browser tabs each for software that promises to be a single source of truth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than accepting this complexity as inevitable, AI-first leaders redesign workflows from first principles. &amp;quot;There are very few legacy systems that can&amp;#x27;t be replaced in your organization, that won&amp;#x27;t be replaced,&amp;quot; Habib said. &amp;quot;But they&amp;#x27;re not going to be replaced by another monolithic piece of software. They can only be replaced by a business leader articulating business logic and getting that into an agentic system.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She offered a concrete example: &amp;quot;We have customers where it used to take them seven months to get a creative campaign — not even a product, a campaign. Now they can go from TikTok trend to digital shelf in 30 days. That is radical simplicity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catch, she emphasized, is that CIOs can&amp;#x27;t drive this transformation alone. &amp;quot;Your CIO can&amp;#x27;t help flatten your org chart. Only a business leader can look at workflows and say, &amp;#x27;This part is necessary genius, this part is bureaucratic scar tissue that has to go.&amp;#x27;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The second shift: Managing the fear as career ladders disappear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When AI handles execution, &amp;quot;your humans are liberated to do what they&amp;#x27;re amazing at: judgment, strategy, creativity,&amp;quot; Habib explained. &amp;quot;The old leadership playbook was about managing headcount. We managed people against revenue: one business development rep for every three account executives, one marketer for every five salespeople.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this liberation carries profound challenges that leaders must address directly. Habib acknowledged the elephant in the room that many executives avoid discussing: &amp;quot;These changes are still frightening for people, even when it&amp;#x27;s become unholy to talk about it.&amp;quot; She&amp;#x27;s witnessed the fear firsthand. &amp;quot;It shows up as tears in an AI workshop when someone feels like their old skill set isn&amp;#x27;t translated to the new.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She introduced a term for a common form of resistance: &amp;quot;productivity anchoring&amp;quot; — when employees &amp;quot;cling to the hard way of doing things because they feel productive, because their self-worth is tied to them, even when empirically AI can be better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution isn&amp;#x27;t to look away. &amp;quot;We have to design new pathways to impact, to show your people their value is not in executing a task. Their value is in orchestrating systems of execution, to ask the next great question,&amp;quot; Habib said. She advocates replacing career &amp;quot;ladders&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;lattices&amp;quot; where &amp;quot;people need to grow laterally, to expand sideways.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was candid about the disruption: &amp;quot;The first rungs on our career ladders are indeed going away. I know because my company is automating them.&amp;quot; But she insisted this creates opportunity for work that is &amp;quot;more creative, more strategic, more driven by curiosity and impact — and I believe a lot more human than the jobs that they&amp;#x27;re replacing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The third shift: When execution becomes free, ambition becomes the only bottleneck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final shift is from optimization to creation. &amp;quot;Before AI, we used to call it transformation when we took 12 steps and made them nine,&amp;quot; Habib said. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s optimizing the world as it is. We can now create a new world. That is the greenfield mindset.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She challenged executives to identify assumptions their industries are built on that AI now disrupts. Writer&amp;#x27;s customers, she said, are already seeing new categories of growth: treating every customer like their only customer, democratizing premium services to broader markets, and entering new markets at unprecedented speed because &amp;quot;AI strips away the friction to access new channels.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When execution is abundant, the only bottleneck is the scope of your own ambition,&amp;quot; Habib declared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What this means for CIOs: Building the stadium while business leaders design the plays&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habib didn&amp;#x27;t leave IT leaders without a role — she redefined it. &amp;quot;If tech is everyone&amp;#x27;s job, you might be asking, what is mine?&amp;quot; she addressed CIOs. &amp;quot;Yours is to provide the mission critical infrastructure that makes this revolution possible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As tens or hundreds of thousands of AI agents operate at various levels of autonomy within organizations, &amp;quot;governance becomes existential,&amp;quot; she explained. &amp;quot;The business leader&amp;#x27;s job is to design the play, but you have to build the stadium, you have to write the rule book, and you have to make sure these plays can win at championship scale.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formulation suggests a partnership model: business leaders drive workflow redesign and strategic implementation while IT provides the infrastructure, governance frameworks, and security guardrails that make mass AI deployment safe and scalable. &amp;quot;One can&amp;#x27;t succeed without the other,&amp;quot; Habib said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CIOs and technical leaders, this represents a fundamental shift from gatekeeper to enabler. When business units deploy agents autonomously, IT faces governance challenges unlike anything in enterprise software history. Success requires genuine partnership between business and IT — neither can succeed alone, forcing cultural changes in how these functions collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A real example: From multi-day scrambles to instant answers during a market crisis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ground her arguments in concrete business impact, Habib described working with the chief client officer of a Fortune 500 wealth advisory firm during recent market volatility following tariff announcements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Their phone was ringing off the hook with customers trying to figure out their market exposure,&amp;quot; she recounted. &amp;quot;Every request kicked off a multi-day, multi-person scramble: a portfolio manager ran the show, an analyst pulled charts, a relationship manager built the PowerPoint, a compliance officer had to review everything for disclosures. And the leader in all this — she was forwarding emails and chasing updates. This is the top job: managing complexity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an agentic AI system, the same work happens programmatically. &amp;quot;A system of agents is able to assemble the answer faster than any number of people could have. No more midnight deck reviews. No more days on end&amp;quot; of coordination, Habib said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#x27;t about marginal productivity gains — it&amp;#x27;s about fundamentally different operating models where senior executives shift from managing coordination to designing intelligent systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why so many AI initiatives are failing despite massive investment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habib&amp;#x27;s arguments arrive as many enterprises face AI disillusionment. After initial excitement about generative AI, many companies have &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;struggled to move beyond pilots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and demonstrations to production deployments generating tangible business value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her diagnosis — that leaders are delegating rather than driving transformation — aligns with growing evidence that organizational factors, not technical limitations, explain most failures. Companies often lack clarity on use cases, struggle with data preparation, or face internal resistance to workflow changes that AI requires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most striking aspect of Habib&amp;#x27;s presentation was her willingness to acknowledge the human cost of AI transformation — and insist leaders address it rather than avoid it. &amp;quot;Your job as a leader is to not look away from this fear. Your job is to face it with a plan,&amp;quot; she told the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She described &amp;quot;productivity anchoring&amp;quot; as a form of &amp;quot;self-sabotage&amp;quot; where employees resist AI adoption because their identity and self-worth are tied to execution tasks AI can now perform. The phenomenon suggests that successful AI transformation requires not just technical and strategic changes but psychological and cultural work that many leaders may be unprepared for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two challenges: Get your hands dirty, then reimagine everything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habib closed by throwing down two gauntlets to her executive audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;First, a small one: get your hands dirty with agentic AI. Don&amp;#x27;t delegate. Choose a process that you oversee and automate it. See the difference from managing a complex process to redesigning it for yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second was more ambitious: &amp;quot;Go back to your team and ask, what could we achieve if execution were free? What would work feel like, be like, look like if you&amp;#x27;re unbound from the friction and process that slows us down today?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She concluded: &amp;quot;The tools for creation are in your hands. The mandate for leadership is on your shoulders. What will you build?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders accustomed to viewing AI as an IT initiative, Habib&amp;#x27;s message is clear: that approach isn&amp;#x27;t working, won&amp;#x27;t work, and reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what AI represents. Whether executives embrace her call to personally drive transformation — or continue delegating to IT departments — may determine which organizations thrive and which become cautionary tales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistic she opened with lingers uncomfortably: 42% of Fortune 500 C-suite executives say AI is tearing their companies apart. Habib&amp;#x27;s diagnosis suggests they&amp;#x27;re tearing themselves apart by clinging to organizational models designed for an era when execution was scarce. The cure she prescribes requires leaders to do something most find uncomfortable: stop managing complexity and start dismantling it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai-is-tearing-companies-apart-writer-ai-ceo-slams-fortune-500-leaders-for</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:02:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Only 4 days until TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 kicks off in San Francisco and ticket rates increase (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/only-4-days-until-techcrunch-disrupt-2025-kicks-off-in-san-francisco-and-ticket-rates-increase/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The wait all year is&amp;nbsp;almost over!

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The round was led by Atomico, alongside existing investors LocalGlobe and Blackbird, and builds on Wonder’s pre-seed investment, which included executives from ElevenLabs, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wonder will use the fresh funds to double its engineering team and accelerate its push into IP ownership and original content production. The team recently produced an AI music video for Lewis Capaldi’s&amp;nbsp;‘Something in the Heavens’, created with DeepMind, YouTube, and Universal Music Group. Wonder also released its first original production, the “Beyond the Loop” anthology series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wonder is working on several commercial and original projects for release next year, including an upcoming documentary with Campfire Studios, the production company behind Netflix documentaries “The Menendez Brothers” and “America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.” Campfire’s CEO Ross Dinerstein is an investor in the startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The drive for IP ownership emerges amid a wave of legal actions from Hollywood producers targeting AI companies — both for training models on their content and for generating outputs featuring copyrighted characters. Disney and Universal Studios, for example, have sued Chinese company MiniMax, as well as AI image generator Midjourney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wonder’s raise also comes as Netflix goes “all in” on generative AI as a way to make creatives more efficient at storytelling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI remains a divisive issue in entertainment, with artists concerned that tools powered by LLMs, which have often been trained on their work without consent, could threaten their livelihoods. OpenAI’s Sora 2 has come under particular criticism for reproducing actors’ likenesses without notice or consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wonder positions itself as “Hollywood without borders,” helping to make AI storytelling tools accessible to all creators. The startup’s app serves as a hub connecting its community of creators with career opportunities, collaborators, and resources, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The next decade will define what creativity looks like in the age of AI,” said Justin Hackney, chief commercial officer and co-founder of Wonder Studios. “Our mission is to ensure that this future belongs to the storytellers. Working with leading studios, industry pioneers, and grassroots filmmakers, we’re already creating a bridge where technology and artistry grow together.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-roy-lee-s-rage-baiting-built-a-15-million-ai-startup"&gt;How Roy Lee’s&amp;nbsp;rage-baiting built a $15 million AI startup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roy Lee&amp;nbsp;is the co-founder and CEO of&amp;nbsp;Cluely, an AI meeting assistant that offers real-time insights&amp;nbsp;and turns conversations&amp;nbsp;into searchable and shareable reports. Hundreds of companies are pitching&amp;nbsp;similar products, so why do we care about&amp;nbsp;Cluely? What really sets Lee apart is his mastery of attention. In an era when most startups fight to be noticed, Lee has made rage-baiting social media content&amp;nbsp;his business model.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lee originally went viral as a Columbia&amp;nbsp;University student&amp;nbsp;who&amp;nbsp;got in&amp;nbsp;trouble for&amp;nbsp;cheating on Big Tech interviews with an AI assistant he built, all of which he documented on social media. Lee then dropped out&amp;nbsp;and launched&amp;nbsp;Cluely, which was initially pitched as the “cheat on everything startup.” It was a tagline designed to ruffle feathers and spur engagement — a strategy that&amp;nbsp;Cluely&amp;nbsp;has become famous for, and others have tried to copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Say&amp;nbsp;what you will about Lee’s marketing efforts, but&amp;nbsp;Cluely&amp;nbsp;routinely breaks through the noise of social media and press releases, earning the startup visibility that companies 10 times its size struggle to buy. Lee operates Cluely on the principle that most companies are playing it too safe and that attention is all you need to win the consumer&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cluely&amp;nbsp;raised $15 million&amp;nbsp;in a Series A from&amp;nbsp;Andreessen Horowitz&amp;nbsp;earlier this year and has spent its funding on flashy launch videos, dozens of content creator interns, and a massive office in San Francisco. Lee is one of the founders at the center of the AI bubble, and&amp;nbsp;he’s&amp;nbsp;used it to his advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="highlights"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlights From Open Source AI Week 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees of Open Source AI Week are getting a peek at the latest advancements and creative projects that are shaping the future of open technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happening onsite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The world’s smallest AI supercomputer: &lt;/b&gt;NVIDIA DGX Spark represents the cutting edge of AI computing hardware for enterprise and research applications.​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86192 size-thumbnail" height="400" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unitree-blog-400x400.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Humanoids and robot dogs, up close: &lt;/b&gt;Unitree robots are on display, captivating attendees with advanced mobility powered by the latest robotics technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why open source is important:&lt;/b&gt; Learn how it can empower developers to build stronger communities, iterate on features, and seamlessly integrate the best of open source AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="research"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accelerating AI Research Through Open Models 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) published today shows how access to open model weights unlocks more opportunities for experimentation, customization and collaboration across the global research community.​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report outlines seven high-impact research use cases where open models are making a difference — including fine-tuning, continued pretraining, model compression and interpretability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With access to weights, developers can adapt models for new domains, explore new architectures and extend functionality to meet their specific needs. This also supports trust and reproducibility. When teams can run experiments on their own hardware, share updates and revisit earlier versions, they gain control and confidence in their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study found that nearly all open model users share their data, weights and code, building a fast-growing culture of collaboration. This open exchange of tools and knowledge strengthens partnerships between academia, startups and enterprises, facilitating innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is committed to empowering the research community through the NVIDIA Nemotron family of open models — featuring not just open weights, but also pretraining and post-training datasets, detailed training recipes, and research papers that share the latest breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the full CSET study to learn how open models are helping the AI community move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="keynote"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advancing Embodied Intelligence Through Open-Source Innovation 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86142 size-medium" height="540" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ptc-keynote-960x540.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the PyTorch Conference, Jim Fan, director of robotics and distinguished research scientist at NVIDIA, discussed the Physical Turing Test — a way of measuring the performance of intelligent machines in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With conversational AI now capable of fluent, lifelike communication, Fan noted that the next challenge is enabling machines to act with similar naturalism. The Physical Turing Test asks: can an intelligent machine perform a real-world task so fluidly that a human cannot tell whether a person or a robot completed it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fan highlighted that progress in embodied AI and physical AI depends on generating large amounts of diverse data, access to open robot foundation models and simulation frameworks — and walked through a unified workflow for developing embodied AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With synthetic data workflows like NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams — built on NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models— developers can generate virtual worlds from images and prompts, speeding the creation of large sets of diverse and physically accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That data can then be used to post-train NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N open foundation models for generalized humanoid robot reasoning and skills. But before the models are deployed in the real world, these new robot skills need to be tested in simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open simulation and learning frameworks such as NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab allow robots to “practice” countless times across millions of virtual environments before operating in the real world, dramatically accelerating learning and deployment cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, with Newton, an open-source, differentiable physics engine built on NVIDIA Warp and OpenUSD, developers can bring high-fidelity simulation to complex robotic dynamics such as motion, balance and contact — reducing the simulation-to-real gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accelerates the creation of physically capable AI systems that learn faster, perform more safely and operate effectively in real-world environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, scaling embodied intelligence isn’t just about compute — it’s about access. Fan reaffirmed NVIDIA’s commitment to open source, emphasizing how the company’s frameworks and foundation models are shared to empower developers and researchers globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can get started with NVIDIA’s open embodied and physical AI models on Hugging Face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nemotron"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B Ranks Among Top Open Models for Multilingual Retrieval 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B model has been recognized as the top open and portable model on the Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built on the meta‑llama/Llama‑3.1‑8B architecture, Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B is a research text embedding model that converts text into 4,096‑dimensional vector representations. Designed for flexibility, it supports a wide range of use cases, including retrieval, reranking, semantic similarity and classification across more than 1,000 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trained on a diverse collection of 16 million query–document pairs — half from public sources and half synthetically generated — the model benefits from refined data generation techniques, hard‑negative mining and model‑merging approaches that contribute to its broad generalization capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result builds on NVIDIA’s ongoing research in open, high‑performing AI models. Following earlier leaderboard recognition for the Llama NeMo Retriever ColEmbed model, the success of Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B highlights the value of openness, transparency and collaboration in advancing AI for the developer community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out Llama-Embed-Nemotron-8B on Hugging Face, and learn more about the model, including architectural highlights, training methodology and performance evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Open Source Teaches Us About Making AI Better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open models are shaping the future of AI, enabling developers, enterprises and governments to innovate with transparency, customization and trust. In the latest episode of the NVIDIA AI Podcast, NVIDIA’s Bryan Catanzaro and Jonathan Cohen discuss how open models, datasets and research are laying the foundation for shared progress across the AI ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Nemotron family of open models represents a full-stack approach to AI development, connecting model design to the underlying hardware and software that power it. By releasing Nemotron models, data and training methodologies openly, NVIDIA aims to help others refine, adapt and build upon its work, resulting in a faster exchange of ideas and more efficient systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we as a community come together — contributing ideas, data and models — we all move faster,” said Catanzaro in the episode. “Open technologies make that possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more happening this week at Open Source AI Week, including the start of the PyTorch Conference — bringing together developers, researchers and innovators pushing the boundaries of open AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees can tune in to the special keynote address by Jim Fan, director of robotics and distinguished research scientist at NVIDIA, to hear the latest advancements in robotics — from simulation and synthetic data to accelerated computing. The keynote, titled “The Physical Turing Test: Solving General Purpose Robotics,” will take place on Wednesday, Oct. 22, from 9:50-10:05 a.m. PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andrej Karpathy’s Nanochat Teaches Developers How to Train LLMs in Four Hours 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer scientist Andrej Karpathy recently introduced Nanochat, calling it “the best ChatGPT that $100 can buy.” Nanochat is an open-source, full-stack large language model (LLM) implementation built for transparency and experimentation. In about 8,000 lines of minimal, dependency-light code, Nanochat runs the entire LLM pipeline — from tokenization and pretraining to fine-tuning, inference and chat — all through a simple web user interface.&lt;br /&gt;NVIDIA is supporting Karpathy’s open-source Nanochat project by releasing two NVIDIA Launchables, making it easy to deploy and experiment with Nanochat across various NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With NVIDIA Launchables, developers can train and interact with their own conversational model in hours with a single click. The Launchables dynamically support different-sized GPUs — including NVIDIA H100 and L40S GPUs — on various clouds without need for modification. They also automatically work on any eight-GPU instance on NVIDIA Brev, so developers can get compute access immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;first 10 users&lt;/b&gt; to deploy these Launchables will also receive free compute access to NVIDIA H100 or L40S GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start training with Nanochat by deploying a Launchable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86022 size-medium" height="527" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/launchable-960x527.png" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andrej Karpathy’s Next Experiments Begin With NVIDIA DGX Spark&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Karpathy received an NVIDIA DGX Spark — the world’s smallest AI supercomputer, designed to bring the power of Blackwell right to a developer’s desktop. With up to a petaflop of AI processing power and 128GB of unified memory in a compact form factor, DGX Spark empowers innovators like Karpathy to experiment, fine-tune and run massive models locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pytorch"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building the Future of AI With PyTorch and NVIDIA 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyTorch, the fastest-growing AI framework, derives its performance from the NVIDIA CUDA platform and uses the Python programming language to unlock developer productivity. This year, NVIDIA added Python as a first-class language to the CUDA platform, giving the PyTorch developer community greater access to CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUDA Python includes key components that make GPU acceleration in Python easier than ever, with built-in support for kernel fusion, extension module integration and simplified packaging for fast deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following PyTorch’s open collaboration model, CUDA Python is available on GitHub and PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_86034"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-86034 size-large" height="672" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pytorch-infographic-1-1680x672.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-86034"&gt;According to PyPI Stats, PyTorch averaged over two million daily downloads, peaking at 2,303,217 on October 14, and had 65 million total downloads last month.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every month, developers worldwide download hundreds of millions of NVIDIA libraries — including CUDA, cuDNN, cuBLAS and CUTLASS — mostly within Python and PyTorch environments. CUDA Python provides nvmath-python, a new library that acts as the bridge between Python code and these highly optimized GPU libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="highlights"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlights From Open Source AI Week 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees of Open Source AI Week are getting a peek at the latest advancements and creative projects that are shaping the future of open technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happening onsite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The world’s smallest AI supercomputer: &lt;/b&gt;NVIDIA DGX Spark represents the cutting edge of AI computing hardware for enterprise and research applications.​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86192 size-thumbnail" height="400" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unitree-blog-400x400.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Humanoids and robot dogs, up close: &lt;/b&gt;Unitree robots are on display, captivating attendees with advanced mobility powered by the latest robotics technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why open source is important:&lt;/b&gt; Learn how it can empower developers to build stronger communities, iterate on features, and seamlessly integrate the best of open source AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="research"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accelerating AI Research Through Open Models 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) published today shows how access to open model weights unlocks more opportunities for experimentation, customization and collaboration across the global research community.​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report outlines seven high-impact research use cases where open models are making a difference — including fine-tuning, continued pretraining, model compression and interpretability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With access to weights, developers can adapt models for new domains, explore new architectures and extend functionality to meet their specific needs. This also supports trust and reproducibility. When teams can run experiments on their own hardware, share updates and revisit earlier versions, they gain control and confidence in their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study found that nearly all open model users share their data, weights and code, building a fast-growing culture of collaboration. This open exchange of tools and knowledge strengthens partnerships between academia, startups and enterprises, facilitating innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is committed to empowering the research community through the NVIDIA Nemotron family of open models — featuring not just open weights, but also pretraining and post-training datasets, detailed training recipes, and research papers that share the latest breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the full CSET study to learn how open models are helping the AI community move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="keynote"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advancing Embodied Intelligence Through Open-Source Innovation 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86142 size-medium" height="540" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ptc-keynote-960x540.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the PyTorch Conference, Jim Fan, director of robotics and distinguished research scientist at NVIDIA, discussed the Physical Turing Test — a way of measuring the performance of intelligent machines in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With conversational AI now capable of fluent, lifelike communication, Fan noted that the next challenge is enabling machines to act with similar naturalism. The Physical Turing Test asks: can an intelligent machine perform a real-world task so fluidly that a human cannot tell whether a person or a robot completed it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fan highlighted that progress in embodied AI and physical AI depends on generating large amounts of diverse data, access to open robot foundation models and simulation frameworks — and walked through a unified workflow for developing embodied AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With synthetic data workflows like NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams — built on NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models— developers can generate virtual worlds from images and prompts, speeding the creation of large sets of diverse and physically accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That data can then be used to post-train NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N open foundation models for generalized humanoid robot reasoning and skills. But before the models are deployed in the real world, these new robot skills need to be tested in simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open simulation and learning frameworks such as NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab allow robots to “practice” countless times across millions of virtual environments before operating in the real world, dramatically accelerating learning and deployment cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, with Newton, an open-source, differentiable physics engine built on NVIDIA Warp and OpenUSD, developers can bring high-fidelity simulation to complex robotic dynamics such as motion, balance and contact — reducing the simulation-to-real gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accelerates the creation of physically capable AI systems that learn faster, perform more safely and operate effectively in real-world environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, scaling embodied intelligence isn’t just about compute — it’s about access. Fan reaffirmed NVIDIA’s commitment to open source, emphasizing how the company’s frameworks and foundation models are shared to empower developers and researchers globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can get started with NVIDIA’s open embodied and physical AI models on Hugging Face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nemotron"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B Ranks Among Top Open Models for Multilingual Retrieval 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B model has been recognized as the top open and portable model on the Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built on the meta‑llama/Llama‑3.1‑8B architecture, Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B is a research text embedding model that converts text into 4,096‑dimensional vector representations. Designed for flexibility, it supports a wide range of use cases, including retrieval, reranking, semantic similarity and classification across more than 1,000 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trained on a diverse collection of 16 million query–document pairs — half from public sources and half synthetically generated — the model benefits from refined data generation techniques, hard‑negative mining and model‑merging approaches that contribute to its broad generalization capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result builds on NVIDIA’s ongoing research in open, high‑performing AI models. Following earlier leaderboard recognition for the Llama NeMo Retriever ColEmbed model, the success of Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B highlights the value of openness, transparency and collaboration in advancing AI for the developer community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out Llama-Embed-Nemotron-8B on Hugging Face, and learn more about the model, including architectural highlights, training methodology and performance evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Open Source Teaches Us About Making AI Better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open models are shaping the future of AI, enabling developers, enterprises and governments to innovate with transparency, customization and trust. In the latest episode of the NVIDIA AI Podcast, NVIDIA’s Bryan Catanzaro and Jonathan Cohen discuss how open models, datasets and research are laying the foundation for shared progress across the AI ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Nemotron family of open models represents a full-stack approach to AI development, connecting model design to the underlying hardware and software that power it. By releasing Nemotron models, data and training methodologies openly, NVIDIA aims to help others refine, adapt and build upon its work, resulting in a faster exchange of ideas and more efficient systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we as a community come together — contributing ideas, data and models — we all move faster,” said Catanzaro in the episode. “Open technologies make that possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more happening this week at Open Source AI Week, including the start of the PyTorch Conference — bringing together developers, researchers and innovators pushing the boundaries of open AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees can tune in to the special keynote address by Jim Fan, director of robotics and distinguished research scientist at NVIDIA, to hear the latest advancements in robotics — from simulation and synthetic data to accelerated computing. The keynote, titled “The Physical Turing Test: Solving General Purpose Robotics,” will take place on Wednesday, Oct. 22, from 9:50-10:05 a.m. PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andrej Karpathy’s Nanochat Teaches Developers How to Train LLMs in Four Hours 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer scientist Andrej Karpathy recently introduced Nanochat, calling it “the best ChatGPT that $100 can buy.” Nanochat is an open-source, full-stack large language model (LLM) implementation built for transparency and experimentation. In about 8,000 lines of minimal, dependency-light code, Nanochat runs the entire LLM pipeline — from tokenization and pretraining to fine-tuning, inference and chat — all through a simple web user interface.&lt;br /&gt;NVIDIA is supporting Karpathy’s open-source Nanochat project by releasing two NVIDIA Launchables, making it easy to deploy and experiment with Nanochat across various NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With NVIDIA Launchables, developers can train and interact with their own conversational model in hours with a single click. The Launchables dynamically support different-sized GPUs — including NVIDIA H100 and L40S GPUs — on various clouds without need for modification. They also automatically work on any eight-GPU instance on NVIDIA Brev, so developers can get compute access immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;first 10 users&lt;/b&gt; to deploy these Launchables will also receive free compute access to NVIDIA H100 or L40S GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start training with Nanochat by deploying a Launchable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86022 size-medium" height="527" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/launchable-960x527.png" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andrej Karpathy’s Next Experiments Begin With NVIDIA DGX Spark&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Karpathy received an NVIDIA DGX Spark — the world’s smallest AI supercomputer, designed to bring the power of Blackwell right to a developer’s desktop. With up to a petaflop of AI processing power and 128GB of unified memory in a compact form factor, DGX Spark empowers innovators like Karpathy to experiment, fine-tune and run massive models locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pytorch"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building the Future of AI With PyTorch and NVIDIA 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyTorch, the fastest-growing AI framework, derives its performance from the NVIDIA CUDA platform and uses the Python programming language to unlock developer productivity. This year, NVIDIA added Python as a first-class language to the CUDA platform, giving the PyTorch developer community greater access to CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUDA Python includes key components that make GPU acceleration in Python easier than ever, with built-in support for kernel fusion, extension module integration and simplified packaging for fast deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following PyTorch’s open collaboration model, CUDA Python is available on GitHub and PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;

The app, which remains at No. 1 in the U.S. and Canada, will introduce video editing tools, offer the ability for users to create character “cameos” of pets and other objects, improve social features, and more. Plus, the company says the Android version of the app is “actually coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement was made on X by Sora head Bill Peebles, who says the new creation tools will arrive in the next few days. These include the ability to turn pets and other items, like a “favorite stuffed toy and pretty much anything else,” into cameos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The term “cameo” refers to the Sora feature where users can make AI personas of themselves after providing the app with a recorded video as a reference file. These cameos can be shared with friends and others, allowing them to make videos with your AI character.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re expecting people to register lots of crazy new cameos with this feature. To make them easier to find, we’re updating the generation UI to show the latest trending cameos in real time,” Peebles wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, he says the app will introduce basic video editing features, starting with stitching together multiple clips. More tools will be added over time. An updated social experience is also underway, which would add new ways of using Sora with friends. These may include dedicated channels specific to a university, company, sports club, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says it’s working to reduce the excessive moderation of generations, which some users have complained is too strict, and improve the overall app performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though the app is currently listed on the Google Play Store for pre-registration, OpenAI hasn’t yet shared a launch date for its arrival. Peebles says it should be live “soon,” but he didn’t offer more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The companies are calling the deal “a multi-year, multi-million-dollar strategic partnership,” but Bloomberg reports, citing anonymous sources, that Lumen is going to spend over $200 million on Palantir’s tech over the course of several years.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The agreement will see Lumen pairing Palantir’s Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) with its own edge computing, broadband infrastructure, and other digital services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partnership comes as Lumen tries to transform itself from a traditional telecom provider into a more modern tech infrastructure play. The company in September said it was “collaborating” with Palantir to integrate the latter’s Foundry and AI software and services into its operations, finance, and technology functions, “to transform its network and services with speed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Lumen would not confirm the deal value, its spokesperson Joe Goode told TechCrunch in an email that the company’s use of Palantir’s tech was a “material contributor” to achieving $350 million in cost reductions in 2025. He added that what the companies learned during that collaboration informed their decision to take their partnership to the enterprise market. Lumen has committed to reducing expenses by $1 billion by 2027, and it says it’s already ahead of plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Palantir demonstrated that its Foundry and AIP platforms could unlock Lumen’s data faster and cheaper than traditional data-lake migrations, and together we’re pursuing solutions to help large enterprises do the same,” Goode said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Palantir, this is the latest in a long string of deals for which it has partnered up with companies and government organizations of all stripes to sell its AI products and services. Including the Lumen deal, Palantir has struck 19 partnerships this year alone, across aviation, healthcare, telecom, contract management, data management, defense, and more sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

Druid AI unveils AI agent ‘factory’ (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/druid-ai-agentic-factory-automation-in-the-real-world/</link><description>&lt;p&gt; At its London Symbiosis 4 event on 22 October, Druid AI introduced what it terms Virtual Authoring Teams – a new generation of AI agents that can design, test, and deploy other AI agents. The announcement marks a move towards what the company calls a ‘factory model’ for AI automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Druid, the system enables organisations to build enterprise-grade AI agents up to ten times faster, and the platform offers orchestration facilities, plus compliance safeguards and measurable ROI tracking. The orchestration engine, Druid Conductor, serves as a control layer that integrates data, tooling, and human oversight into a single framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to the Druid Conductor is the Druid Agentic Marketplace, a repository of pre-built, industry-specific agents for banking, healthcare, education, and insurance. With its solutions, Druid wants to make agentic AI accessible to non-technical users, but provide scalability capability suitable for enterprise use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Joe Kim described it as “AI [that] actually works” – a bold claim in a market flooded with experimentation and unproven automation frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The new agentic battleground&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Druid is not alone in its pursuit. Similar platforms, the likes of Cognigy, Kore.ai, and Amelia, each represent heavy investment in multi-agent orchestration environments. OpenAI’s GPTs and Anthropic’s Claude Projects also allow users to design semi-autonomous digital workers without coding expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google’s Vertex AI Agents and Microsoft’s Copilot Studio are moving in the same direction, placing agentic AI as an extension to enterprise ecosystems rather than stand-alone products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The difference between the competing platforms lies in execution – some focus on workflow automation, others on conversational depth or ease of integration with other parts of the IT stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For technology buyers, such diversity is an opportunity and a risk. Vendors are racing to define what agentic AI means in practice, and there’s an undoubted element of agentic AI being 2025’s buzzword, implying differentiation between pure LLM models and practical tools useful in business contexts. Some vendors view agentic as an architecture – modular, distributed, and explainable, while others frame agentic AI as a layer of automation that builds itself – or rather, can discover what powers it’s been granted, and use them according to natural language instructions. The truth of agentic AI’s abilities sits somewhere between engineering promises and operational reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The business case – and the caveats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agentic AI systems promise extraordinary benefits. They can accelerate routine development, coordinate multiple business functions, and use data repositories that were once siloed. For enterprises under pressure to deliver digital transformation with limited headcount, the idea of self-building AI teams is compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the use of the conditional tense in many vendors’ marketing materials and descriptions is telling: agentic AI &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; achieve savings, &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; drive faster operations, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Business leaders should approach such systems with a clear head. There are few proven case studies beyond pilot programmes inside large corporations (those with mature data governance and deep budgets), and even in those organisations, the returns have been uneven. Failures are rarely shouted from the rooftops, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The biggest risks are not technical – they’re organisational. Delegating complex decision-making to automated agents without sufficient oversight introduces potential bias, compliance breaches, and reputational exposure. Systems can also generate automation debt: a growing tangle of interconnected bots that become difficult to monitor or update as business processes evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The issue of necessary organisational change is troubling on two counts, furthermore. Most business processes have evolved a particular way for good reasons, so why change them to implement a new, largely unproven technology? Secondly, what’s often proposed is change that’s instigated by technology implementation. Shouldn’t processes change for strategic reasons, and technology support that change? Is this a case of the IT tail wagging the business dog?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Security remains a further concern. Each agent increases the surface area for potential breaches or data misuse, particularly when they are designed to communicate and collaborate autonomously. As more workflows become self-directed, ensuring traceability and accountability becomes essential, and more difficult to unpick as complexity increases. The necessary headcount to monitor results and ensure rigorous oversight could negate any ROI agentic AI offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why agentic AI attracts enterprises&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the challenges, the attraction is easy to understand. A successful agentic system can transform the speed at which an enterprise experiments and scales. By delegating repeatable cognitive tasks – from compliance checks to customer service triage – organisations can redirect human activity elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Druid’s Virtual Authoring Teams encapsulate the logic: automate the automation. Its marketplace of domain-specific agents offers enterprises a head start, promising faster deployments and measurable ROI. For sectors struggling with talent shortages and regulatory pressure, that is an appealing prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, Druid’s emphasis on explainable AI and its orchestration layer suggests an awareness of corporate caution. Its stated pillars – control, accuracy, and results – are designed to reassure boards that transparency can coexist with speed. If the system truly delivers what the company claims, it could narrow the gap between AI experimentation and scalable transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Balancing autonomy with accountability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, for every organisation embracing agentic AI, another remains unconvinced. Many enterprises are wary of over-promising vendors and pilot fatigue. A technology capable of designing and deploying its own successors raises operational questions. What happens when an agent acts beyond its creator’s intent? How do governance frameworks keep pace?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Business leaders must treat autonomy as a spectrum, not a goal. The near future of enterprise AI will likely blend human-supervised automation with limited agentic autonomy. Systems like Druid’s may act as orchestration hubs rather than fully independent actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From hype to utility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agentic AI represents a natural evolution of automation in a wild frontier. Its potential is obvious, yet the market still lacks broad, evidence-based validation of sustained business outcomes. It may just be early days, or may be hyperbole drowning out the voices of reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For now, agentic systems &lt;i&gt;do work&lt;/i&gt; in controlled contexts – contact-centre operations, document processing, and IT service management. Scaling agentic AI across organisations will require maturity not just in technology, but in culture, process design, and methods of oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Druid and its peers expand their offerings, enterprises will need to weigh the cost of control against the promised wins from better automation. The next two years will determine whether AI factories become a part of business operations, or another layer of abstraction with its own overheads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Black and grey wolf (female from Druid pack,’Half Black’) walking in road near Lamar River bridge” by YellowstoneNPS is marked with Public Domain Mark 1.0. )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

And for researchers with expertise in a particular technique, it’s a great time to raise funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s part of the driving force behind Tensormesh, launching out of stealth this week with $4.5 million in seed funding. The investment was led by Laude Ventures, with additional angel funding from database pioneer Michael Franklin.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tensormesh is using the money to build a commercial version of the open source LMCache utility, launched and maintained by Tensormesh co-founder Yihua Cheng. Used well, LMCache can reduce inference costs by as much as 10x — a power that’s made it a staple in open source deployments and drawn in integrations from heavy hitters like Google and Nvidia. Now Tensormesh is planning to parlay that academic reputation into a viable business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The core of the product is the key-value cache (or KV cache), a memory system used to process complex inputs more efficiently by condensing them down to their key values. In traditional architectures, the KV cache is discarded at the end of each query — but Tensormesh co-founder and CEO Junchen Jiang argues that this is an enormous source of inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s like having a very smart analyst reading all the data, but they forget what they have learned after each question,” says Jiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead of discarding that cache, Tensormesh’s systems hold on to it, allowing it to be redeployed when the model executes a similar process in a separate query. Because GPU memory is so precious, this can mean spreading data across several different storage layers, but the reward is significantly more inference power for the same server load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The change is particularly powerful for chat interfaces, since models need to continually refer back to the growing chat log as the conversation progresses. Agentic systems have a similar issue, with a growing log of actions and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In theory, these are changes AI companies can execute on their own — but the technical complexity makes it a daunting task. Given the Tensormesh team’s work researching the process and the intricacy of the detail itself, the company is betting there will be lots of demand for an out-of-the-box product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Keeping the KV cache in a secondary storage system and reused efficiently without slowing the whole system down is a very challenging problem,” says Jiang. “We’ve seen people hire 20 engineers and spend three or four months to build such a system. Or they can use our product and do it very efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Humanoids.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;With the AI infrastructure push reaching staggering proportions, there’s more pressure than ever to squeeze as much inference as possible out of the GPUs they have.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company explains that Mico (its name a nod to “Microsoft Copilot”) is meant to offer consumers a “warm” and “customizable” visual presence that “listens, reacts, and even changes colors to reflect your interactions.” &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If the talking AI helper immediately brings to mind Microsoft’s infamous productivity assistant, Clippy, you wouldn’t be wrong in thinking that. It seems that Microsoft has decided to embrace the reference to its age-old companion, as there’s even an Easter egg where, if you tap Mico a number of times, it will transform into Clippy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature is enabled by default when you’re using Copilot’s voice mode, but users can turn it off if they choose. It’s initially available in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., and will be able to save memories of your conversations and learn from your feedback, Microsoft says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A “Learn Live” mode for U.S. users can make Copilot a tutor that guides you through concepts instead of just providing an answer. The company notes it’s made other improvements in areas like health-related questions and deep research, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As we build this,&amp;nbsp;we’re&amp;nbsp;not chasing engagement or&amp;nbsp;optimizing for&amp;nbsp;screen time.&amp;nbsp;We’re&amp;nbsp;building&amp;nbsp;AI&amp;nbsp;that gets you back to your life. That deepens human connection. That earns your trust,” wrote CEO of Microsoft AI, Mustafa Suleyman, in an announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft is not the only chatbot maker to anthropomorphize its AI. Market leader ChatGPT, for instance, offers a visual experience as well, with a number of different voice options. Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok has turned its AI into risque AI companions. Across the app stores, AI companion apps are already pulling in millions, indicating there is consumer demand for AI characters to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, whether or not consumers will respond to Mico’s floating blob remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says it’s also working to evolve Copilot’s personality and tone, with the introduction of a new mode called “Real Talk.” This will allow the AI to mirror the user’s conversational style, but won’t be as sycophantic as other AI assistants have been. Instead, Microsoft says that it will feel like something that’s “grounded in its own perspective,” and will push back and challenge your ideas, which could encourage you to see things from a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3061438" height="363" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mico-anime.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Mico&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finding a balance between a helpful, conversational AI and one that leads users down rabbit holes has proven tricky. Several incidents of AI chatbot psychosis have been reported, where AI users come to have their delusional beliefs reinforced by their conversation with the chatbot. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The fall Copilot update introduced a number of other new features to Microsoft’s AI, including the ability to bring friends into your Copilot AI chats, support for long-term memory, connectors to link productivity apps like email and cloud storage, and expanded AI integrations for its browser, Microsoft Edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said it’s working to evolve Edge into an AI browser that would be able to see your tabs, summarize and compare information, and take action for you on things like booking a hotel or filling out forms. This would allow Edge to compete with other AI browsers, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity’s Comet, Dia, and others, as well as market leader Chrome, which has integrated its Gemini AI. &lt;/p&gt;

More than a simple extension, the new CoPilot Mode of Microsoft’s Edge browser is the company’s take on the long-hyped AI browser category — an intelligent and flexible AI assistant that follows you as you browse the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, even described the new product in those terms in the announcement. “Copilot Mode in Edge is evolving into an AI browser that is your dynamic, intelligent companion,” Suleyman wrote in the announcement post. “With your permission, Copilot can see and reason over your open tabs, summarize and compare information, and even take actions like booking a hotel or filling out forms.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement comes just two days after a similar launch from OpenAI, which showed off its new Atlas browser. Of course, Copilot’s release has been scheduled for weeks, and new Copilot Mode has probably been in development for months. Neither company invented the idea of an AI-assisted web browser. But the visual similarity between the two products is hard to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3061444" height="440" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-23-at-1.01.41-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A demo frame from Microsoft’s CopIlot for Edge announcement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3061446" height="451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-23-at-1.03.36-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A Demo frame from OpenAI’s Atlas announcement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These are two very similar pictures. The Copilot for Edge background is a little darker, there’s text instead of a logo, and the close/minimize buttons follow Windows conventions instead of MacOS conventions. Beyond that, Copilot puts its “ride-along” function in a new tab instead of a split-screen… but that’s about it. It’s pretty much the same product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Part of the similarity is functional: people like clean browsers, and there are only so many ways to integrate a chatbot window into the “new tab” screen. For users, the main difference will come from the underlying models, so maybe a little facial similarity doesn’t make too big a difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Browsers mostly look the same anyway. But given the high stakes of the AI race and the tense state of play between the two companies, it seems significant that we got both of these browsers in the same week.&lt;/p&gt;
