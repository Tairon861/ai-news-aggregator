Instead, he believes that the more likely future is a hybrid combination of SaaS plus agents, he said, speaking onstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt; “Generally, once you have a business process, you want to be able to define that in, effectively, business logic with deterministic systems — just because the risk of that changing any given day is very high,” explained Levie.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you’re doing something mission critical — we’ve already seen great examples of either data being leaked because of agents, or an agent going and, you know, maybe blowing up your database or doing something in production you didn’t expect. So you want to have some sort of ‘church and state’ between the deterministic side of your software and the non-deterministic side.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He painted a picture of a future of enterprise software where the SaaS is used for the core business workflow, and then the agents ride on top of that. These agents would be helpful with making decisions, automating workflows, or, essentially, just accelerating whatever process the person was trying to do in the system, the exec said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Levie pointed out that this reconfiguration would dramatically impact the business model of enterprise SaaS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The thing that I’m very convinced of is we’ll have about 100 times more, maybe 1,000 times more, agents than we have people. So you’ll have way more users of that software system, or SaaS, as agents,” Levie said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As a result, the typical “per-seat” business model would no longer work, and instead, companies would have to sell some form of consumption and volume-oriented use cases with AI agents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These changes are a market opportunity for startups, particularly those that are building for the agent-first era, rather than bigger companies that are trying to integrate agents into existing processes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Smaller startups, he said, have no business processes to change, so they can design a new process in an agent-first way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This presents an opportunity for startups to build solutions for the enterprise space to make the change management process easier and more palatable, Levie said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He encouraged entrepreneurs to capitalize on this shift by building. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are in this window right now that we have not been in for about 15 years, which is — there’s a complete platform shift happening in tech that’s opening up a spot for a new set of companies to emerge,” Levie said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“And I would just, you know, try and fully exploit that.” &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244026103.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Box co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie doesn’t think AI agents will replace enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies.

It&amp;#x27;s already being used by Cursor’s own engineering staff in day-to-day development — indicating maturity and stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cursor, Composer completes most interactions in &lt;b&gt;less than 30 seconds&lt;/b&gt; while maintaining a high level of reasoning ability across large and complex codebases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model is described as four times faster than similarly intelligent systems and is trained for “agentic” workflows—where autonomous coding agents plan, write, test, and review code collaboratively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Cursor supported &amp;quot;vibe coding&amp;quot; — using AI to write or complete code based on natural language instructions from a user, even someone untrained in development — &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/docs/models"&gt;atop other leading proprietary LLMs&lt;/a&gt; from the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI. These options are still available to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benchmark Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composer’s capabilities are benchmarked using &amp;quot;Cursor Bench,&amp;quot; an internal evaluation suite derived from real developer agent requests. The benchmark measures not just correctness, but also the model’s adherence to existing abstractions, style conventions, and engineering practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this benchmark, Composer achieves frontier-level coding intelligence while generating at &lt;a href="https://x.com/srush_nlp/status/1983614856646578662"&gt;250 tokens per second&lt;/a&gt; — about twice as fast as leading fast-inference models and four times faster than comparable frontier systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cursor’s published comparison groups models into several categories: “Best Open” (e.g., Qwen Coder, GLM 4.6), “Fast Frontier” (Haiku 4.5, Gemini Flash 2.5), “Frontier 7/2025” (the strongest model available midyear), and “Best Frontier” (including GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5). Composer matches the intelligence of mid-frontier systems while delivering the highest recorded generation speed among all tested classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Model Built with Reinforcement Learning and Mixture-of-Experts Architecture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research scientist Sasha Rush of Cursor provided insight into the model’s development in &lt;a href="https://x.com/srush_nlp/status/1983572683355725869"&gt;posts on the social network X&lt;/a&gt;, describing Composer as a reinforcement-learned (RL) mixture-of-experts (MoE) model:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used RL to train a big MoE model to be really good at real-world coding, and also very fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush explained that the team co-designed both Composer and the Cursor environment to allow the model to operate efficiently at production scale:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unlike other ML systems, you can’t abstract much from the full-scale system. We co-designed this project and Cursor together in order to allow running the agent at the necessary scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composer was trained on real software engineering tasks rather than static datasets. During training, the model operated inside full codebases using a suite of production tools—including file editing, semantic search, and terminal commands—to solve complex engineering problems. Each training iteration involved solving a concrete challenge, such as producing a code edit, drafting a plan, or generating a targeted explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reinforcement loop optimized both correctness and efficiency. Composer learned to make effective tool choices, use parallelism, and avoid unnecessary or speculative responses. Over time, the model developed emergent behaviors such as running unit tests, fixing linter errors, and performing multi-step code searches autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This design enables Composer to work within the same runtime context as the end-user, making it more aligned with real-world coding conditions—handling version control, dependency management, and iterative testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Prototype to Production&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composer’s development followed an earlier internal prototype known as &lt;b&gt;Cheetah&lt;/b&gt;, which Cursor used to explore low-latency inference for coding tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cheetah was the v0 of this model primarily to test speed,” Rush said on X. “Our metrics say it [Composer] is the same speed, but much, much smarter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheetah’s success at reducing latency helped Cursor identify speed as a key factor in developer trust and usability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composer maintains that responsiveness while significantly improving reasoning and task generalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers who used Cheetah during early testing noted that its speed changed how they worked. One user commented that it was “so fast that I can stay in the loop when working with it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composer retains that speed but extends capability to multi-step coding, refactoring, and testing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integration with Cursor 2.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composer is fully integrated into Cursor 2.0, a major update to the company’s agentic development environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform introduces a multi-agent interface, allowing&lt;b&gt; up to eight agents to run in parallel,&lt;/b&gt; each in an isolated workspace using git worktrees or remote machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within this system, Composer can serve as one or more of those agents, performing tasks independently or collaboratively. Developers can compare multiple results from concurrent agent runs and select the best output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cursor 2.0 also includes supporting features that enhance Composer’s effectiveness:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In-Editor Browser (GA)&lt;/b&gt; – enables agents to run and test their code directly inside the IDE, forwarding DOM information to the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improved Code Review&lt;/b&gt; – aggregates diffs across multiple files for faster inspection of model-generated changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sandboxed Terminals (GA)&lt;/b&gt; – isolate agent-run shell commands for secure local execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Voice Mode&lt;/b&gt; – adds speech-to-text controls for initiating or managing agent sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these platform updates expand the overall Cursor experience, Composer is positioned as the technical core enabling fast, reliable agentic coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Infrastructure and Training Systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To train Composer at scale, Cursor built a custom reinforcement learning infrastructure combining PyTorch and Ray for asynchronous training across thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed specialized MXFP8 MoE kernels and hybrid sharded data parallelism, enabling large-scale model updates with minimal communication overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This configuration allows Cursor to train models natively at low precision without requiring post-training quantization, improving both inference speed and efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composer’s training relied on hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed environments—each a self-contained coding workspace—running in the cloud. The company adapted its Background Agents infrastructure to schedule these virtual machines dynamically, supporting the bursty nature of large RL runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enterprise Use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composer’s performance improvements are supported by infrastructure-level changes across Cursor’s code intelligence stack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has optimized its Language Server Protocols (LSPs) for faster diagnostics and navigation, especially in Python and TypeScript projects. These changes reduce latency when Composer interacts with large repositories or generates multi-file updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise users gain administrative control over Composer and other agents through team rules, audit logs, and sandbox enforcement. Cursor’s Teams and Enterprise tiers also support pooled model usage, SAML/OIDC authentication, and analytics for monitoring agent performance across organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing for individual users ranges from Free (Hobby) to Ultra ($200/month) tiers, with expanded usage limits for Pro+ and Ultra subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business pricing starts at $40 per user per month for Teams, with enterprise contracts offering custom usage and compliance options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Composer’s Role in the Evolving AI Coding Landscape&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composer’s focus on speed, reinforcement learning, and integration with live coding workflows differentiates it from other AI development assistants such as GitHub Copilot or Replit’s Agent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than serving as a passive suggestion engine, Composer is designed for continuous, agent-driven collaboration, where multiple autonomous systems interact directly with a project’s codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model-level specialization—training AI to function within the real environment it will operate in—represents a significant step toward practical, autonomous software development. Composer is not trained only on text data or static code, but within a dynamic IDE that mirrors production conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush described this approach as essential to achieving real-world reliability: the model learns not just how to generate code, but how to integrate, test, and improve it in context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What It Means for Enterprise Devs and Vibe Coding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Composer, Cursor is introducing more than a fast model—it’s deploying an AI system optimized for real-world use, built to operate inside the same tools developers already rely on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of reinforcement learning, mixture-of-experts design, and tight product integration gives Composer a practical edge in speed and responsiveness that sets it apart from general-purpose language models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Cursor 2.0 provides the infrastructure for multi-agent collaboration, Composer is the core innovation that makes those workflows viable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the first coding model built specifically for agentic, production-level coding—and an early glimpse of what everyday programming could look like when human developers and autonomous models share the same workspace.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;The vibe coding tool Cursor, from startup &lt;a href="https://anysphere.inc/"&gt;Anysphere&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/blog/composer"&gt;introduced Composer&lt;/a&gt;, its first in-house, proprietary coding large language model (LLM) as part of its &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/blog/2-0"&gt;Cursor 2.0 platform update&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composer is designed to execute coding tasks quickly and accurately in production-scale environments, representing a new step in AI-assisted programming.

Composer is not trained only on text data or static code, but within a dynamic IDE that mirrors production conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush described this approach as essential to achieving real-world reliability: the model learns not just how to generate code, but how to integrate, test, and improve it in context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What It Means for Enterprise Devs and Vibe Coding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Composer, Cursor is introducing more than a fast model—it’s deploying an AI system optimized for real-world use, built to operate inside the same tools developers already rely on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of reinforcement learning, mixture-of-experts design, and tight product integration gives Composer a practical edge in speed and responsiveness that sets it apart from general-purpose language models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Cursor 2.0 provides the infrastructure for multi-agent collaboration, Composer is the core innovation that makes those workflows viable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the first coding model built specifically for agentic, production-level coding—and an early glimpse of what everyday programming could look like when human developers and autonomous models share the same workspace.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/vibe-coding-platform-cursor-releases-first-in-house-llm-composer-promising</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 19:28:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Meta denies torrenting porn to train AI, says downloads were for “personal use” (AI – Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/meta-says-porn-downloads-on-its-ips-were-for-personal-use-not-ai-training/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;This week, Meta asked a US district court to toss a lawsuit alleging that the tech giant illegally torrented pornography to train AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes after Strike 3 Holdings discovered illegal downloads of some of its adult films on Meta corporate IP addresses, as well as other downloads that Meta allegedly concealed using a “stealth network” of 2,500 “hidden IP addresses.” Accusing Meta of stealing porn to secretly train an unannounced adult version of its AI model powering Movie Gen, Strike 3 sought damages that could have exceeded $350 million, TorrentFreak reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filing a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Monday, Meta accused Strike 3 of relying on “guesswork and innuendo,” while writing that Strike 3 “has been labeled by some as a ‘copyright troll’ that files extortive lawsuits.” Requesting that all copyright claims be dropped, Meta argued that there was no evidence that the tech giant directed any of the downloads of about 2,400 adult movies owned by Strike 3—or was even aware of the illegal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strike 3 also cited “no facts to suggest that Meta has ever trained an AI model on adult images or video, much less intentionally so,” Meta argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These claims are bogus,” Meta’s spokesperson told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta argues downloads were for “personal use”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the flagged downloads spanned seven years, starting in 2018. That’s about four years before Meta’s AI efforts “researching Multimodal Models and Generative Video” began—making it implausible the downloads were intended for AI training, Meta argued. An even more “glaring” defect, Meta argued, is that Meta’s terms prohibit generating adult content, “contradicting the premise that such materials might even be useful for Meta’s AI training.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Meta argued, available evidence “is plainly indicative” that the flagged adult content was torrented for “private personal use”—since the small amount linked to Meta IP addressess and employees represented only “a few dozen titles per year intermittently obtained one file at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The far more plausible inference to be drawn from such meager, uncoordinated activity is that disparate individuals downloaded adult videos for personal use,” Meta’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, unlike lawsuits raised by book authors whose works are part of an enormous dataset used to train AI, the activity on Meta’s corporate IP addresses only amounted to about 22 downloads per year. That is nowhere near the “concerted effort to collect the massive datasets Plaintiffs allege are necessary for effective AI training,” Meta argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, that alleged activity can’t even reliably be linked to any Meta employee, Meta argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strike 3 “does not identify any of the individuals who supposedly used these Meta IP addresses, allege that any were employed by Meta or had any role in AI training at Meta, or specify whether (and which) content allegedly downloaded was used to train any particular Meta model,” Meta wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, “tens of thousands of employees,” as well as “innumerable contractors, visitors, and third parties access the Internet at Meta every day,” Meta argued. So while it’s “possible one or more Meta employees” downloaded Strike 3’s content over the last seven years, “it is just as possible” that a “guest, or freeloader,” or “contractor, or vendor, or repair person—or any combination of such persons—was responsible for that activity,” Meta suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other alleged activity included a claim that a Meta contractor was directed to download adult content at his father’s house, but those downloads, too, “are plainly indicative of personal consumption,” Meta argued. That contractor worked as an “automation engineer,” Meta noted, with no apparent basis provided for why he would be expected to source AI training data in that role. “No facts plausibly” tie “Meta to those downloads,” Meta claimed.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that the torrenting allegedly stopped when his contract with Meta ended says nothing about whether the alleged torrenting was performed with Meta’s knowledge or at its direction,” Meta wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta slams AI training theory as “nonsensical”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly most baffling to Meta in Strike 3’s complaint, however, is the claim about the “stealth network” of hidden IPs. This presents “yet another conundrum” that Strike 3 “fails to address,” Meta suggested, writing, “why would Meta seek to ‘conceal’ certain alleged downloads of Plaintiffs’ and third-party content, but use easily traceable Meta corporate IP addresses for many hundreds of others?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The obvious answer is that it would not do so,” Meta argued,” slamming Strike 3’s “entire AI training theory” as “nonsensical and unsupported.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Meta noted that Strike 3 cannot claim that Meta should have been better at “policing” its network for illegal activity. “Monitoring every file downloaded by any person using Meta’s global network would be an extraordinarily complex and invasive undertaking,” Meta argued, citing precedent that only requires Meta employ a “simple measure” to monitor such activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta is hoping the court will agree that Strike 3 failed to prove Meta had anything to do with the illegal downloads. Strike 3 has two weeks to respond, TorrentFreak reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Meta, defeating the lawsuit is not just a matter of avoiding damages but also defending its commitment to ensuring its AI video tools don’t generate explicit content that’s increasingly regulated. In the filing, Meta suggested that Strike 3 provided no evidence that Meta trained AI on its content because “there was none.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want this type of content, and we take deliberate steps to avoid training on this kind of material,” Meta’s spokesperson told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other alleged activity included a claim that a Meta contractor was directed to download adult content at his father’s house, but those downloads, too, “are plainly indicative of personal consumption,” Meta argued. That contractor worked as an “automation engineer,” Meta noted, with no apparent basis provided for why he would be expected to source AI training data in that role. “No facts plausibly” tie “Meta to those downloads,” Meta claimed.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The fact that the torrenting allegedly stopped when his contract with Meta ended says nothing about whether the alleged torrenting was performed with Meta’s knowledge or at its direction,” Meta wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta slams AI training theory as “nonsensical”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly most baffling to Meta in Strike 3’s complaint, however, is the claim about the “stealth network” of hidden IPs. This presents “yet another conundrum” that Strike 3 “fails to address,” Meta suggested, writing, “why would Meta seek to ‘conceal’ certain alleged downloads of Plaintiffs’ and third-party content, but use easily traceable Meta corporate IP addresses for many hundreds of others?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The obvious answer is that it would not do so,” Meta argued,” slamming Strike 3’s “entire AI training theory” as “nonsensical and unsupported.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Meta noted that Strike 3 cannot claim that Meta should have been better at “policing” its network for illegal activity. “Monitoring every file downloaded by any person using Meta’s global network would be an extraordinarily complex and invasive undertaking,” Meta argued, citing precedent that only requires Meta employ a “simple measure” to monitor such activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta is hoping the court will agree that Strike 3 failed to prove Meta had anything to do with the illegal downloads. Strike 3 has two weeks to respond, TorrentFreak reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Meta, defeating the lawsuit is not just a matter of avoiding damages but also defending its commitment to ensuring its AI video tools don’t generate explicit content that’s increasingly regulated. In the filing, Meta suggested that Strike 3 provided no evidence that Meta trained AI on its content because “there was none.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want this type of content, and we take deliberate steps to avoid training on this kind of material,” Meta’s spokesperson told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;

Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt, Yakovenko said he’s become increasingly comfortable taking a back seat in software development tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI has been a great force multiplier for somebody who’s an expert,” said Yakovenko, describing his experience with agentic coding after more than 15 years developing software. “Now I can just watch Claude churning through its thing and I can almost smell when it’s going off the rails.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If people are in a meeting with me and I’m not paying attention,” he continued, “it’s because I’m watching Claude.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Co-founder of the Solana cryptocurrency protocol, Yakovenko has seen immense success this year, even as many cryptocurrencies have struggled. The system announced $2.85 billion in annual revenue earlier this month, fueled largely by crypto trading platforms. Even more impressive was the Solana coin’s first exchange-traded fund (or ETF), launched the day before Yakovenko took the stage. Launched by the crypto asset manager Bitwise, the fund saw nearly $70 million of inflows in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Onstage, Yakovenko attributed the success to a growing acceptance of crypto, especially from the conventional finance industry. “If you are a back-office finance person, you actually get crypto much, much faster,” Yakovenko said. “Finance people deal with settlement risk all the time. They deal with banking risk all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the same period, cryptocurrency has drawn significant new criticism for enabling public bribery, particularly in connection with the Solana-hosted Trumpcoin. The coin has directed an estimated $350 million to the president, which critics see as a form of bribery — particularly in the wake of Trump’s high-profile pardons for Tron founder Justin Sun and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But as long as Solana is an open protocol, Yakovenko has little control over the coins it hosts. “I could send you an email with a link to Trumpcoin or Fartcoin,” Yakovenko explained onstage, “and both of those are protocols, both the email and the underlying protocol that creates that market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Generally, if you’re not in deep tech, then you need to low-key deep focus on distribution,” Lee told the crowd at Disrupt 2025.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But he also made it clear that not everyone was cut out for this kind of viral marketing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you’re any good at engineering, you’re probably not funny and you’re probably not going to be a content creator because you don’t have it in your blood. Realistically, most of these people have no chance of going viral.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cluely’s AI assistant grew famous this April with a viral claim that its undetectable windows could “help you cheat on anything” — a claim that was quickly disproven when a string of proctoring services showed they could, in fact, detect use of the AI assistant. But in a matter of months, the company had raised $15 million from Andressen Horowitz, becoming one of the most visible products in the crowded AI assistant space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Lee frames it, it’s part of his talent for going viral, which often means making lots of people very angry at him. “I think I’m particularly good at framing myself in a way that’s controversial,” he said onstage. “I do a lot of things that are different. And everything I do that’s different, I frame it through the filter of my voice. And my voice is naturally just very enraging to a lot of people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Lee, it’s part of a broader theory of social media, in which attention is the only currency. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Reputation is sort of a thing of the past,” Lee said. “You can try to be the New York Times and guard your ironclad reputation, but realistically you’ve got Sam Altman on the timeline talking about hot guys and you’ve got Elon Musk going batshit crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You just have to realize that the world is trending to a different place,” he continued, “where you have to be extreme, you have to be authentic and you have to be personal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s hard to say how well that strategy is working, though. When asked for Cluely’s revenue numbers or user numbers, however, Lee demurred. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What I’ve learned is that you should never share revenue numbers because if you’re doing well, nobody will talk about how well you’re doing. And if you’re doing poorly, people will only talk about how poorly you’re doing,” Lee said.“I’ll say we’re doing better than I expected, but it’s not the fastest growing company of all time.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-29-at-4.12.02-PM.jpg?resize=1200,676" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cluely’s Roy Lee has a message for startup founders: you should be thinking harder about how to go viral.&lt;/p&gt;
