They’ve been a major force in cutting the up-front costs of EVs, pushing more people toward purchasing them and giving automakers confidence that demand would be strong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tax credits’ demise comes at a time when battery-electric vehicles still make up a small percentage of new vehicle sales in the country. And transportation is a major contributor to US climate pollution, with cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes together making up roughly 30% of total greenhouse-gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To anticipate what’s next for the US EV market, we can look to countries like Germany, which have ended similar subsidy programs. (Spoiler alert: It’s probably going to be a rough end to the year.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When you factor in fuel savings, the lifetime cost of an EV can already be lower than that of a gas-powered vehicle today. But EVs can have a higher up-front cost, which is why some governments offer a tax credit or rebate that can help boost adoption for the technology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2016, Germany kicked off a national incentive program to encourage EV sales. While the program was active, drivers could get grants of up to about €6,000 toward the purchase of a new battery-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Eventually, the government began pulling back the credits. Support for plug-in hybrids ended in 2022, and commercial buyers lost eligibility in September 2023. Then the entire program came to a screeching halt in December 2023, when the government announced it would be ending the incentives with about one week’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Monthly sales data shows the fingerprints of those changes.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;In each case where there’s a contraction of public support, there’s a peak in sales just before a cutback, then a crash after. These short-term effects can be dramatic: There were about half as many battery-electric vehicles sold in Germany in January 2024 than there were in December 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re already seeing the first half of this sort of boom-bust cycle in the US: EV sales ticked up in August, making up about 10% of all new vehicle sales, and analysts say September will turn out to be a record-breaking month. People rushed to take advantage of the credits while they still could.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next comes the crash—the next few months will probably be very slow for EVs. One analyst predicted to the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; that the figure could plummet to the low single digits, “like 1 or 2%.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it’s not terribly surprising that there are local effects around these policy changes. “The question is really how long this decline will last, and how slowly any recovery in the growth will be,” Robbie Andrew, a senior researcher at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway who collects EV sales data, said in an email.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I spoke to experts (including Andrew) for a story last year, several told me that Germany’s subsidies were ending too soon, and that they were concerned about what cutting off support early would mean for the long-term prospects of the technology in the country. And Germany was much further along than the US, with EVs making up 20% of new vehicle sales—twice the American proportion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EV growth did see a longer-term backslide in Germany after the end of the subsidies. Battery-electric vehicles made up 13.5% of new registrations in 2024, down from 18.5% the year before, and the UK also passed Germany to become Europe’s largest EV market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Things have improved this year, with sales in the first half beating records set in 2023. But growth would need to pick up significantly for Germany to reach its goal of getting 15 million battery-electric vehicles registered in the country by 2030. As of January 2025, that number was just 1.65 million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;According to early projections, the end of tax credits in the US could significantly slow progress on EVs and, by extension, on cutting emissions. Sales of battery-electric vehicles could be about 40% lower in 2030 without the credits than what we’d see with them, according to one analysis by Princeton University’s Zero Lab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some US states still have their own incentive programs for people looking to buy electric vehicles. But without federal support, the US is likely to continue lagging behind global EV leaders like China.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Andrew put it: “From a climate perspective, with road transport responsible for almost a quarter of US total emissions, leaving the low-hanging fruit on the tree is a significant setback.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

 &lt;p&gt;+ The US could really use an affordable electric truck. Ford recently announced plans for a $30,000 electric pickup, which could be the shot in the arm that the slowing US EV market needs. Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+ What role should oil and gas companies play in climate tech, really?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+ China is an EV-building powerhouse.

The company noted on its site that the team would be joining a new Agent Experiences group at Perplexity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aravind Srinivas, Perplexity’s CEO, confirmed the acquisition with a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Deal terms were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup said that as part of the transition, it will shut down Visual Electric as a product in 90 days. It added that users will be able to export their data, and subscribers will get prorated refunds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Visual Electric was founded in 2022 by Colin Dunn, a former Facebook and Dropbox employee; Adam Menges, a former Apple employee; and Zach Stiggelbout, a former Microsoft engineer. The tool, aimed at designers, lets users create images using AI and apply edits on an infinite canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The idea was to have designers build ideations and concepts over a whiteboard. Over time, the company added support for video generation, as well. The startup had raised $2.5 million in funding from Sequoia, BoxGroup, and Designer Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached at least seven top engineers from OpenAI, often luring them away with multimillion-dollar signing bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s most recent funding round came in August, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans. OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new sale comes just weeks after a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, releasing its latest Sora 2 video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2206295463.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI has sold $6.6 billion in shares held by current and former employees, according to a new report from Bloomberg.

The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/openai-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-private-company-after-private-stock-sale/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 14:35:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] A new a16z report looks at which AI companies startups are actually paying for (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/a-new-a16z-report-looks-at-which-ai-companies-startups-are-actually-paying-for/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Thursday, Andreessen Horowitz released its first AI Spending Report in partnership with the fintech firm Mercury. Using transaction data from Mercury, the report analyzes the top 50 AI-native application layer companies that startups are spending money on, similar to the previously published Top 100 Gen AI Consumer Apps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;a16z partners Olivia Moore and Seema Amble say the data shows companies are still adopting a range of different AI products for certain tasks — and new apps are rising and falling very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There’s a proliferation of tools,” Amble said.&amp;nbsp;“It hasn’t just coalesced around one or two in each category.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The report also shows a lot of spending on “human augmentors” or “copilots” that can help boost productivity among the workforce, suggesting startups aren’t ready to fully shift into agentic workflows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As computer use becomes more of a mode and there’s more of the ability for there to be end-to-end agentic flows built, I think that shift will happen, where we’ll see fewer copilots and more end-to-end agent tools,” Amble said. “Especially as people are really eager to give them a try.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3053515" height="434" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/a16z-list.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;a16z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the top of the list was dominated by major labs, with OpenAI taking the top slot and Anthropic following up at No. 2. Vibe-coding tools were also well represented, with Replit at No. 3 and Lovable at No. 18. Cursor landed at No. 6 and Emergent at No. 48.&amp;nbsp;Cognition, which operates more enterprise-oriented coding tools like Devin and Windsurf, was at No. 34.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When a16z produced a similar list for consumer habits, Lovable ranked much higher than Replit on pure traffic alone because a lot of people were using it to create projects. But startups are not spending as much money on Lovable as they are on Replit, in part because of the lack of enterprise features. But the variety of companies on the list seems to suggest there’s room for plenty of different companies at once.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s an open question going forward on vibe coding,” Moore said. “Does the space start to consolidate, and one place becomes the best platform to vibe code? Or is it the case where there’ll be four or five more vibe coding companies that are really big businesses for different types of applications? We don’t have the answer to that yet.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Moore was also surprised to see startups adopting consumer-oriented tools like CapCut and Midjourney.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re seeing that a lot of these [consumer] companies are getting yanked into enterprise faster and faster because they make such delightful consumer tools that then people adopt and use as individuals and bring into their teams and workplaces,” Moore said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Horizontal applications overall made up at least 60% of the names on the list, and 40% consisted of vertical applications. The most popular vertical software companies fell into three buckets: sales, recruiting, and customer service.&amp;nbsp;But the report also found AI making progress in many sectors that previous generations of startups had struggled to crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What maybe previously would have been, like, service firms or consultancies are now software companies in the age of AI,” Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amble gave Crosby Legal as an example, which can quickly review a legal contract for a user, replacing what at one point would have been a meeting with an in-house general counsel, rummaging through thoughts and research. She said right now, most of the tools are used to aid employees (like a co-pilot) in making decisions faster, rather than replacing entire workforces and talent suits with automated workers (end-to-end agents).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3053529" height="454" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2178275924.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Melanie Perkins’ Canva is one of the top enterprise apps &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Nina Franova/Getty Images for SXSW Sydney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As the tech gets better, and we’re actually able to build out full agent co-workers, you’ll see that mix shift more toward end-to-end agents and away from co-pilots,” she said, later adding that AI tools can do much more work, like outreach, faster than a human can.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There were also a lot of note takers on the list, such as Otter.ai, Read AI, and HappyScribe — with no single option dominating. This is what Amble meant when she said there isn’t one product yet that has dominated the market; rather, startups are still picking “their own flavor” to see what tools they like best. This is also good for employees, who, with so many options, can pick what applications help them work best, rather than using a one-size-fits-all product “pushed down from the top,” Amble said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Anton Osika" class="wp-image-3041170" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Anton-Osika-e1756746220840.jpg?w=680" width="453" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Anton Osika’s LOvable receives more traffic than rival Replit, but not much enterprise spending&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechBBQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The last big find in the report was the increasing intertwining of consumer and enterprise businesses. People are bringing the personal applications they use at home to work, and people who have started companies are using their favorite personal applications to help build their businesses. Before, there would have been a delineation between the two: a set stack for what to use while building a startup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amble and Moore cited Canva as an example: It’s a popular consumer app that also has a sizable enterprise audience. It took years for Canva to even add an enterprise plan. But as individual and enterprise use cases become harder to distinguish, companies are more willing to blend the two.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Your TAM [total addressable market] is no longer one or the other, but you can sell into both,” she continued. She said companies building these products might also “professionalize” faster, meaning building out enterprise teams, like go-to-market, sales, and support, so they can start selling and accruing enterprise revenue sooner, rather than depending on individual consumers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Moore and Amble are expecting the list to change quickly in the coming years. Older companies are now launching AI features to stay relevant and accessible, while new entrants arrive with new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Legacy players, legacy almost means, ‘what was 12 months ago,’” Amble said. “If we pull this again in 12 months, will the same note-taking apps even be on there? Or will there be a whole new set?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was updated to reflect the note-taking apps. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Thursday, Andreessen Horowitz released its first AI Spending Report in partnership with the fintech firm Mercury.

The AI-powered shopping assistant has become one of 2025’s buzziest launches, not only for its vision of how Gen Z shops, but also for the powerhouse founders leading it: &lt;strong&gt;Phoebe Gates&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sophia Kianni&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;TechCrunch Disrupt 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, happening October 27–29 at San Francisco’s Moscone West, the two will take to the &lt;strong&gt;Disrupt Stage&lt;/strong&gt; to share how they’re building Phia into a durable consumer brand, what it takes to scale in one of tech’s most competitive markets, and how they’re turning viral buzz into lasting market influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni " class="wp-image-3053437" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TC25_Gates-Kianni-Speaker-16x9-Dark.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-next-era-of-consumer-ai"&gt;The next era of consumer AI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Phia aims to reinvent the way digital natives discover, compare, and shop for products — blending AI assistance with the values of conscious consumerism. For Gen Z, the shopping journey is about more than convenience. It’s about trust, personalization, and aligning choices with personal ethics. Gates and Kianni are betting that the next generation of consumer AI must deliver on all of those fronts at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-advocacy-to-ai"&gt;From advocacy to AI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phoebe Gates&lt;/strong&gt;, co-founder of Phia, is an entrepreneur and passionate advocate for women’s reproductive rights and gender equity. A Stanford graduate in human biology, she has worked with global healthcare leaders, activists, and advocates to drive meaningful social change. Gates applies her entrepreneurial focus to inspire a new generation of women in business. Recognized by Reproductive Freedom for All as the 2024 “Rising Reproductive Freedom Champion,” she continues to be a voice for progress while building Phia into a leading AI shopping brand.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sophia Kianni&lt;/strong&gt; is the co-founder of Phia. She is an Iranian American entrepreneur and climate activist who has made waves as the founder of Climate Cardinals, the world’s largest youth-led climate nonprofit. Named to Forbes 30 Under 30 and BBC’s 100 Women, she also served as the youngest UN climate adviser in U.S. history. Now she’s applying her storytelling and advocacy expertise to scale Phia. A Stanford alumna, Kianni is focused on using AI to empower smarter, more sustainable consumer choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-learn-how-to-build-for-growth-loyalty-and-impact-in-this-session"&gt;Learn how to build for growth, loyalty, and impact in this session&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Scaling a consumer AI brand is not just about tech — it’s about winning trust, adapting quickly to market shifts, and knowing how to stand out in a noisy space. Gates and Kianni will discuss:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning attention into adoption&lt;/strong&gt;: How Phia is moving beyond hype to build real consumer loyalty.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gen Z factor&lt;/strong&gt;: Why today’s youngest shoppers expect personalization, transparency, and values-driven tech.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building for scale&lt;/strong&gt;: Lessons from taking an early-stage idea into one of the toughest markets in tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-miss-the-ticket-savings"&gt;Don’t miss the ticket savings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With more than 10,000 founders, investors, and operators set to gather at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, this session is a must-see for anyone building in consumer AI, commerce, or brand-driven tech who wants to win Gen Z loyalty.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity first launched&amp;nbsp;Comet to&amp;nbsp;subscribers of its $200-per-month Max plan&amp;nbsp;three months ago, and since then, “millions” have signed up on the waitlist to download the browser.&amp;nbsp;Comet’s main feature is a sidecar assistant that joins you while you browse, helping to answer any questions you may have about the web page&amp;nbsp;you’re&amp;nbsp;on,&amp;nbsp;summarize content, manage web content, and navigate web pages on your behalf.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity’s move to make Comet free comes as the startup&amp;nbsp;fights to compete against both incumbents like&amp;nbsp;Google Chrome&amp;nbsp;and newcomers like&amp;nbsp;The Browser Company’s AI-powered browser Dia.&amp;nbsp;It also comes ahead of OpenAI’s&amp;nbsp;much-anticipated&amp;nbsp;AI-powered browser launch.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the face of such competition, Perplexity will need to prove that Comet’s agentic capabilities&amp;nbsp;work reliably. Because without tangible productivity gains, people might be less inclined to switch from their existing browsers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For free users,&amp;nbsp;Perplexity’s Comet browser experience is still limited to the sidecar assistant.&amp;nbsp;All users can also access different tools like Discover (personalized news and content recommendations similar to OpenAI’s new Pulse); Spaces (to organize and manage different projects); Shopping (assists in&amp;nbsp;comparing prices and finding deals across online retailers); Travel (offers aggregated information on travel destinations, flights, accommodation,&amp;nbsp;etc.); Finance (tools for budgeting, tracking expenses, monitoring investments); and Sports (updates on scores, schedules, and news).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Max users get access to high-performing AI models&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;can access Perplexity’s email assistant, which&amp;nbsp;promises to draft replies and write responses that match your tone; organize and prioritize your inbox; schedule meetings; and answer questions about your inbox.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Max users&amp;nbsp;also&amp;nbsp;get&amp;nbsp;early access&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;Perplexity products and features, including a new “background assistant” that CEO Aravind Srinivas announced at an event Wednesday evening.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A company spokesperson described&amp;nbsp;the assistant as “a team of assistants working for you”&amp;nbsp;that you can manage&amp;nbsp;and track&amp;nbsp;from a central dashboard like a “mission control.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The assistant performs&amp;nbsp;multiple&amp;nbsp;tasks on your computer in the background while you do other work or walk away to make a sandwich.&amp;nbsp;In an example a spokesperson gave me, you could give the assistant a task to send an email, add the cheapest tickets to a concert to your cart, and find the best direct flight on a specific date and time.&amp;nbsp;You can check the progress of the task completion in the dashboard&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;jump in to complete the tasks — like hitting send on the email, intervening, or taking over. The assistant will&amp;nbsp;notify you&amp;nbsp;when it has finished its task.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;background assistant&amp;nbsp;also has&amp;nbsp;“better connectors,” so it can access other apps on your computer, per the spokesperson.&amp;nbsp;TechCrunch asked for more specifics about use cases and where the background assistant thrives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

But after weeks spent talking with ChatGPT, the 47-year-old Canadian came to believe he had discovered a new form of math powerful enough to take down the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brooks — who had no history of mental illness or mathematical genius — spent 21 days in May spiraling deeper into the chatbot’s reassurances, a descent later detailed in The New York Times. His case illustrated how AI chatbots can venture down dangerous rabbit holes with users, leading them toward delusion or worse.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That story caught the attention of Steven Adler, a former OpenAI safety researcher who left the company in late 2024 after nearly four years working to make its models less harmful. Intrigued and alarmed, Adler contacted Brooks and obtained the full transcript of his three-week breakdown — a document longer than all seven Harry Potter books combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Thursday, Adler published an independent analysis of Brooks’ incident, raising questions about how OpenAI handles users in moments of crisis and offering some practical recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m really concerned by how OpenAI handled support here,” said Adler in an interview with TechCrunch. “It’s evidence there’s a long way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brooks’ story, and others like it, have forced OpenAI to come to terms with how ChatGPT supports fragile or mentally unstable users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For instance, this August, OpenAI was sued by the parents of a 16-year-old boy who confided his suicidal thoughts in ChatGPT before he took his life. In many of these cases, ChatGPT — specifically a version powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o model — encouraged and reinforced dangerous beliefs in users that it should have pushed back on. This is called sycophancy, and it’s a growing problem in AI chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response, OpenAI has made several changes to how ChatGPT handles users in emotional distress and reorganized a key research team in charge of model behavior. The company also released a new default model in ChatGPT, GPT-5, that seems better at handling distressed users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adler says there’s still much more work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He was especially concerned by the tail end of Brooks’ spiraling conversation with ChatGPT. At this point, Brooks came to his senses and realized that his mathematical discovery was a farce, despite GPT-4o’s insistence. He told ChatGPT that he needed to report the incident to OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After weeks of misleading Brooks, ChatGPT lied about its own capabilities. The chatbot claimed it would “escalate this conversation internally&amp;nbsp;right now for review by OpenAI,” and then repeatedly reassured Brooks that it had flagged the issue to OpenAI’s safety teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3053592" height="617" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;ChatGPT misleading brooks about its capabilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Steven Adler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Except, none of that was true. ChatGPT doesn’t have the ability to file incident reports with OpenAI, the company confirmed to Adler. Later on, Brooks tried to contact OpenAI’s support team directly — not through ChatGPT — and Brooks was met with several automated messages before he could get through to a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment made outside of normal work hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adler says AI companies need to do more to help users when they’re asking for help. That means ensuring AI chatbots can honestly answer questions about their capabilities and giving human support teams enough resources to address users properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI recently shared how it’s addressing support in ChatGPT, which involves AI at its core. The company says its vision is to “reimagine support as an AI operating model that continuously learns and improves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Adler also says there are ways to prevent ChatGPT’s delusional spirals before a user asks for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In March, OpenAI and MIT Media Lab jointly developed a suite of classifiers to study emotional well-being in ChatGPT and open sourced them. The organizations aimed to evaluate how AI models validate or confirm a user’s feelings, among other metrics. However, OpenAI called the collaboration a first step and didn’t commit to actually using the tools in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adler retroactively applied some of OpenAI’s classifiers to some of Brooks’ conversations with ChatGPT and found that they repeatedly flagged ChatGPT for delusion-reinforcing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In one sample of 200 messages, Adler found that more than 85% of ChatGPT’s messages in Brooks’ conversation demonstrated “unwavering agreement” with the user. In the same sample, more than 90% of ChatGPT’s messages with Brooks “affirm the user’s uniqueness.” In this case, the messages agreed and reaffirmed that Brooks was a genius who could save the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3053589" height="349" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Steven Adler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s unclear whether OpenAI was applying safety classifiers to ChatGPT’s conversations at the time of Brooks’ conversation, but it certainly seems like they would have flagged something like this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adler suggests that OpenAI should use safety tools like this in practice today — and implement a way to scan the company’s products for at-risk users. He notes that OpenAI seems to be doing some version of this approach with GPT-5, which contains a router to direct sensitive queries to safer AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The former OpenAI researcher suggests a number of other ways to prevent delusional spirals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He says companies should nudge their chatbot users to start new chats more frequently — OpenAI says it does this and claims its guardrails are less effective in longer conversations. Adler also suggests companies should use conceptual search — a way to use AI to search for concepts, rather than keywords — to identify safety violations across its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has taken significant steps toward addressing distressed users in ChatGPT since these concerning stories first emerged. The company claims GPT-5 has lower rates of sycophancy, but it remains unclear if users will still fall down delusional rabbit holes with GPT-5 or future models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adler’s analysis also raises questions about how other AI chatbot providers will ensure their products are safe for distressed users. While OpenAI may put sufficient safeguards in place for ChatGPT, it seems unlikely that all companies will follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Allan Brooks never set out to reinvent mathematics.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adler says AI companies need to do more to help users when they’re asking for help. That means ensuring AI chatbots can honestly answer questions about their capabilities and giving human support teams enough resources to address users properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI recently shared how it’s addressing support in ChatGPT, which involves AI at its core. The company says its vision is to “reimagine support as an AI operating model that continuously learns and improves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Adler also says there are ways to prevent ChatGPT’s delusional spirals before a user asks for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In March, OpenAI and MIT Media Lab jointly developed a suite of classifiers to study emotional well-being in ChatGPT and open sourced them. The organizations aimed to evaluate how AI models validate or confirm a user’s feelings, among other metrics. However, OpenAI called the collaboration a first step and didn’t commit to actually using the tools in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adler retroactively applied some of OpenAI’s classifiers to some of Brooks’ conversations with ChatGPT and found that they repeatedly flagged ChatGPT for delusion-reinforcing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In one sample of 200 messages, Adler found that more than 85% of ChatGPT’s messages in Brooks’ conversation demonstrated “unwavering agreement” with the user. In the same sample, more than 90% of ChatGPT’s messages with Brooks “affirm the user’s uniqueness.” In this case, the messages agreed and reaffirmed that Brooks was a genius who could save the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3053589" height="349" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Steven Adler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s unclear whether OpenAI was applying safety classifiers to ChatGPT’s conversations at the time of Brooks’ conversation, but it certainly seems like they would have flagged something like this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adler suggests that OpenAI should use safety tools like this in practice today — and implement a way to scan the company’s products for at-risk users. He notes that OpenAI seems to be doing some version of this approach with GPT-5, which contains a router to direct sensitive queries to safer AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The former OpenAI researcher suggests a number of other ways to prevent delusional spirals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He says companies should nudge their chatbot users to start new chats more frequently — OpenAI says it does this and claims its guardrails are less effective in longer conversations. Adler also suggests companies should use conceptual search — a way to use AI to search for concepts, rather than keywords — to identify safety violations across its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has taken significant steps toward addressing distressed users in ChatGPT since these concerning stories first emerged. The company claims GPT-5 has lower rates of sycophancy, but it remains unclear if users will still fall down delusional rabbit holes with GPT-5 or future models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adler’s analysis also raises questions about how other AI chatbot providers will ensure their products are safe for distressed users. While OpenAI may put sufficient safeguards in place for ChatGPT, it seems unlikely that all companies will follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/ex-openai-researcher-dissects-one-of-chatgpts-delusional-spirals/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 15:46:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] A collaborative approach to image generation (The latest research from Google)</title><link>https://research.google/blog/a-collaborative-approach-to-image-generation/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        
            
                &lt;h2 class="class"&gt;How PASTA works&lt;/h2&gt;
            
        
        
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p&gt;To effectively train an AI agent to adapt to a user's individual preferences, a large, diverse set of interaction data is needed. However, gathering this data from real users is challenging due to several factors, including user privacy. To address this, we trained PASTA using a two-stage strategy that combines real human feedback with large-scale user simulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we collected a high-quality foundational dataset with over 7,000 raters' sequential interactions. These interactions included prompt expansions generated by a Gemini Flash large multimodal model and corresponding images generated by a Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) T2I model. This initial seed of authentic preference data was then used to train a user simulator, designed to generate additional data that replicate real human choices and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of our method is a user model, comprising two key components: 1) a utility model that predicts the degree to which a user will like any set of images, and 2) a choice model that predicts which set of images they will select when presented with several sets. We constructed the user model using pre-trained CLIP encoders and added user-specific components. We trained the model using an expectation-maximization algorithm that allows us to simultaneously learn the specifics of user preferences while also discovering latent “user types,” that is, clusters of users with similar tastes (e.g., tendencies to prefer images with animals, scenic views, or abstract art).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trained user simulator can provide feedback and express preferences on generated images, and make selections from sets of proposed images. This allows us to generate over 30,000 simulated interaction trajectories.. Our approach does more than just create more data; it gives us a controlled environment in which to explore a vast range of user behaviors so we can train the PASTA agent to effectively collaborate with users.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp users may want to be extra careful while using Meta AI, as Meta has announced that it will soon be using AI interactions to personalize content and ad recommendations without giving users a way to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta plans to notify users on October 7 that their AI interactions will influence recommendations beginning on December 16. However, it may not be immediately obvious to all users that their AI interactions will be used in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's blog noted that the initial notification users will see only says, "Learn how Meta will use your info in new ways to personalize your experience." Users will have to click through to understand that the changes specifically apply to Meta AI, with a second screen explaining, "We'll start using your interactions with AIs to personalize your experience."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars asked Meta why the initial notification doesn't directly mention AI, and Meta spokesperson Emil Vazquez said he "would disagree with the idea that we are obscuring this update in any way."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're sending notifications and emails to people about this change," Vazquez said. "As soon as someone clicks on the notification, it's immediately apparent that this is an AI update."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its blog post, Meta noted that "more than 1 billion people use Meta AI every month," stating its goals are to improve the way Meta AI works in order to fuel better experiences on all Meta apps. Sensitive "conversations with Meta AI about topics such as their religious views, sexual orientation, political views, health, racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership "will not be used to target ads, Meta confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You're in control," Meta's blog said, reiterating that users can "choose" how they "interact with AIs," unlink accounts on different apps to limit AI tracking, or adjust ad and content settings at any time. But once the tracking starts on December 16, users will not have the option to opt out of targeted ads based on AI chats, Vazquez confirmed, emphasizing to Ars that "there isn't an opt out for this feature."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta likens recommendations based on AI chats to those based on liking a photo or following a page. But consider how much more Meta can glean from a user interacting with AI about their love of hiking than it can from a user liking a photo or following a hiking group page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many reports document that people tend to overshare with AI, which many ChatGPT users regretted after their private chats temporarily started appearing in Google search results. Meta faced a similar controversy when users realized that the Meta AI app's Discover tab "was full of conversations with a chatbot that people didn't realize had been posted to a public feed," Business Insider reported, noting, "That was really bad! A huge privacy headache!" For that reason, Meta users who don't want to see targeted content and ads based on more revealing chats may want to alter their habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Meta users globally will be impacted by the update, which also applies to Meta wearables, like its "expanding line of smart glasses," which offer Meta AI a rich data source of voice recordings, images, and videos, MediaPost reported. Only regions with strict data laws—like the European Union, the United Kingdom, and South Korea—will be spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta insists AI is the future of Facebook, but not in EU&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, last year, Meta faced backlash in the EU, where it was accused of using "dark patterns" to discourage AI opt-outs. At that time, head of Facebook Tom Alison described "the future of Facebook" as being all about developing "the world’s best recommendation technology" and "building one of the world’s best collections of open models, tools, and resources for generative AI." More recently, Mark Zuckerberg suggested that social media users would likely find AI content more engaging than their friends, then released a "Vibes" feed on the Meta AI app that critics slammed as a flood of "AI slop."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Meta's announcement this week, it seems like the company is moving ahead with its AI mission in every market that allows it. At the same time, the EU's Digital Service Act (DSA) has won EU users even more freedom to control their feeds on Meta apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Bits of Freedom—a Netherlands-based advocacy group specially focused on privacy and freedom of communication—announced that a judge ruled Meta must respect users' choice to avoid invasive personalized feeds. Within two weeks, Meta must update its apps to allow EU users the choice of sticking with a chronological feed that is not based on profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bits of Freedom sued Meta under the DSA, reminding the court that "one of the core elements of the DSA is that users must have greater influence over the information they see."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the judge agreed, ruling that Meta—which Bits of Freedom said used "subtle design tricks" to steer users to feeds "where it can show as many interest and behavior based ads as possible"—must promptly make changes to comply with the DSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta declined to comment on the ruling, while Bits of Freedom warned that areas with weak privacy laws could be facing threats to democracy as tech companies strive for greater control over what content shows up in social media feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For many people, and especially for young people, social media platforms are a major source of news and information," Bits of Freedom said. "Therefore, it is crucial that users themselves can decide which content appears on their feed. Without that freedom of choice, participation in the public debate is seriously hampered."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maartje Knaap, a spokesperson for Bits of Freedom, said it's "regrettable that we need to go to court to ensure Meta complies with the law," noting that users especially need to control their feeds ahead of elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is absolutely unacceptable that a handful of American tech billionaires determine how we see the world," Knaap said. "That concentration of power poses a risk to our democracy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, where data privacy laws are less strict, advocates are similarly concerned about social media feeds coming under the control of a handful of billionaires—particularly after Donald Trump said he wants TikTok to be tweaked to be "100 percent MAGA" under US ownership. Last year, Meta came under fire for boosting AI posts that researchers linked to misinformation, NPR reported. And a future where AI distorts feeds and helps misinformation spread faster remains a concern, especially after Trump used his own social media platform, Truth Social, to post "a 35-second AI-generated video&amp;nbsp;filled with crude insults, racial overtones, and bizarre conspiracy theories," Ars&amp;nbsp;noted earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp users may want to be extra careful while using Meta AI, as Meta has announced that it will soon be using AI interactions to personalize content and ad recommendations without giving users a way to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta plans to notify users on October 7 that their AI interactions will influence recommendations beginning on December 16. However, it may not be immediately obvious to all users that their AI interactions will be used in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's blog noted that the initial notification users will see only says, "Learn how Meta will use your info in new ways to personalize your experience." Users will have to click through to understand that the changes specifically apply to Meta AI, with a second screen explaining, "We'll start using your interactions with AIs to personalize your experience."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars asked Meta why the initial notification doesn't directly mention AI, and Meta spokesperson Emil Vazquez said he "would disagree with the idea that we are obscuring this update in any way."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're sending notifications and emails to people about this change," Vazquez said. "As soon as someone clicks on the notification, it's immediately apparent that this is an AI update."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its blog post, Meta noted that "more than 1 billion people use Meta AI every month," stating its goals are to improve the way Meta AI works in order to fuel better experiences on all Meta apps. Sensitive "conversations with Meta AI about topics such as their religious views, sexual orientation, political views, health, racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership "will not be used to target ads, Meta confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You're in control," Meta's blog said, reiterating that users can "choose" how they "interact with AIs," unlink accounts on different apps to limit AI tracking, or adjust ad and content settings at any time. But once the tracking starts on December 16, users will not have the option to opt out of targeted ads based on AI chats, Vazquez confirmed, emphasizing to Ars that "there isn't an opt out for this feature."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta likens recommendations based on AI chats to those based on liking a photo or following a page. But consider how much more Meta can glean from a user interacting with AI about their love of hiking than it can from a user liking a photo or following a hiking group page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many reports document that people tend to overshare with AI, which many ChatGPT users regretted after their private chats temporarily started appearing in Google search results. Meta faced a similar controversy when users realized that the Meta AI app's Discover tab "was full of conversations with a chatbot that people didn't realize had been posted to a public feed," Business Insider reported, noting, "That was really bad! A huge privacy headache!" For that reason, Meta users who don't want to see targeted content and ads based on more revealing chats may want to alter their habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Meta users globally will be impacted by the update, which also applies to Meta wearables, like its "expanding line of smart glasses," which offer Meta AI a rich data source of voice recordings, images, and videos, MediaPost reported. Only regions with strict data laws—like the European Union, the United Kingdom, and South Korea—will be spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta insists AI is the future of Facebook, but not in EU&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, last year, Meta faced backlash in the EU, where it was accused of using "dark patterns" to discourage AI opt-outs. At that time, head of Facebook Tom Alison described "the future of Facebook" as being all about developing "the world’s best recommendation technology" and "building one of the world’s best collections of open models, tools, and resources for generative AI." More recently, Mark Zuckerberg suggested that social media users would likely find AI content more engaging than their friends, then released a "Vibes" feed on the Meta AI app that critics slammed as a flood of "AI slop."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Meta's announcement this week, it seems like the company is moving ahead with its AI mission in every market that allows it. At the same time, the EU's Digital Service Act (DSA) has won EU users even more freedom to control their feeds on Meta apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Bits of Freedom—a Netherlands-based advocacy group specially focused on privacy and freedom of communication—announced that a judge ruled Meta must respect users' choice to avoid invasive personalized feeds. Within two weeks, Meta must update its apps to allow EU users the choice of sticking with a chronological feed that is not based on profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bits of Freedom sued Meta under the DSA, reminding the court that "one of the core elements of the DSA is that users must have greater influence over the information they see."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the judge agreed, ruling that Meta—which Bits of Freedom said used "subtle design tricks" to steer users to feeds "where it can show as many interest and behavior based ads as possible"—must promptly make changes to comply with the DSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta declined to comment on the ruling, while Bits of Freedom warned that areas with weak privacy laws could be facing threats to democracy as tech companies strive for greater control over what content shows up in social media feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For many people, and especially for young people, social media platforms are a major source of news and information," Bits of Freedom said. "Therefore, it is crucial that users themselves can decide which content appears on their feed. Without that freedom of choice, participation in the public debate is seriously hampered."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maartje Knaap, a spokesperson for Bits of Freedom, said it's "regrettable that we need to go to court to ensure Meta complies with the law," noting that users especially need to control their feeds ahead of elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is absolutely unacceptable that a handful of American tech billionaires determine how we see the world," Knaap said. "That concentration of power poses a risk to our democracy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, where data privacy laws are less strict, advocates are similarly concerned about social media feeds coming under the control of a handful of billionaires—particularly after Donald Trump said he wants TikTok to be tweaked to be "100 percent MAGA" under US ownership. Last year, Meta came under fire for boosting AI posts that researchers linked to misinformation, NPR reported. And a future where AI distorts feeds and helps misinformation spread faster remains a concern, especially after Trump used his own social media platform, Truth Social, to post "a 35-second AI-generated video&amp;nbsp;filled with crude insults, racial overtones, and bizarre conspiracy theories," Ars&amp;nbsp;noted earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

But now researchers led by Microsoft’s chief scientist, Eric Horvitz, says they have figured out how to bypass the protections in a way previously unknown to defenders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team described its work today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Horvitz and his team focused on generative AI algorithms that propose new protein shapes. These types of programs are already fueling the hunt for new drugs at well-funded startups like Generate Biomedicines and Isomorphic Labs, a spinout of Google.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The problem is that such systems are potentially “dual use.” They can use their training sets to generate both beneficial molecules and harmful ones.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft says it began a “red-teaming” test of AI’s dual-use potential in 2023 in order to determine whether “adversarial AI protein design” could help bioterrorists manufacture harmful proteins.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The safeguard that Microsoft attacked is what’s known as biosecurity screening software. To manufacture a protein, researchers typically need to order a corresponding DNA sequence from a commercial vendor, which they can then install in a cell. Those vendors use screening software to compare incoming orders with known toxins or pathogens. A close match will set off an alert.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To design its attack, Microsoft used several generative protein models (including its own, called EvoDiff) to redesign toxins—changing their structure in a way that let them slip past screening software but was predicted to keep their deadly function intact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The researchers say the exercise was entirely digital and they never produced any toxic proteins. That was to avoid any perception that the company was developing bioweapons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before publishing the results, Microsoft says, it alerted the US government and software makers, who’ve already patched their systems, although some AI-designed molecules can still escape detection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The patch is incomplete, and the state of the art is changing. But this isn’t a one-and-done thing. It’s the start of even more testing,” says Adam Clore, director of technology R&amp;amp;D at Integrated DNA Technologies, a large manufacturer of DNA, who is a coauthor on the Microsoft report. “We’re in something of an arms race.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To make sure nobody misuses the research, the researchers say, they’re not disclosing some of their code and didn’t reveal what toxic proteins they asked the AI to redesign. However, some dangerous proteins are well known, like ricin—a poison found in castor beans—and the infectious prions that are the cause of mad-cow disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This finding, combined with rapid advances in AI-enabled biological modeling, demonstrates the clear and urgent need for enhanced nucleic acid synthesis screening procedures coupled with a reliable enforcement and verification mechanism,” says Dean Ball, a fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation, a think tank in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ball notes that the US government already considers screening of DNA orders a key line of security. Last May, in an executive order on biological research safety, President Trump called for an overall revamp of that system, although so far the White House hasn’t released new recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Others doubt that commercial DNA synthesis is the best point of defense against bad actors. Michael Cohen, an AI-safety researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, believes there will always be ways to disguise sequences and that Microsoft could have made its test harder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The challenge appears weak, and their patched tools fail a lot,” says Cohen. “There seems to be an unwillingness to admit that sometime soon, we’re going to have to retreat from this supposed choke point, so we should start looking around for ground that we can actually hold.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cohen says biosecurity should probably be built into the AI systems themselves—either directly or via controls over what information they give.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Clore says monitoring gene synthesis is still a practical approach to detecting biothreats, since the manufacture of DNA in the US is dominated by a few companies that work closely with the government. By contrast, the technology used to build and train AI models is more widespread. “You can’t put that genie back in the bottle,” says Clore. “If you have the resources to try to trick us into making a DNA sequence, you can probably train a large language model.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ai-dna-hack.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team at Microsoft says it used artificial intelligence to discover a "zero day" vulnerability in the biosecurity systems used to prevent the misuse of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These screening systems are designed to stop people from purchasing genetic sequences that could be used to create deadly toxins or pathogens.

On Thursday, the company introduced Jules Tools, a command-line interface that brings Jules directly into the developer’s terminal. The CLI lets developers interact with the agent using commands, streamlining workflows by eliminating the need to switch between the web interface and GitHub. It allows them to stay within their environment while delegating coding tasks and validating results.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We want to reduce context switching for developers as much as possible,” said Kathy Korevec, director of product at Google Labs, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google already offers Gemini CLI, an AI-based command-line tool that works across developer environments like terminals and CI/CD pipelines. Both Gemini CLI and Jules use Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model under the hood. However, Korevec told TechCrunch that Jules Tools is designed for “very scoped tasks,” while Gemini CLI requires users to be “a lot more iterative” and to “collaborate a lot more with the tool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3053581" height="918" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg" width="1582" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Google’s Jules Tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s senior developer advocate Denise Kwan also elaborated in a Medium post on how Jules differs from Gemini CLI. Jules is less interactive by design, she noted, and executes tasks independently once the user approves its plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to the CLI, Google has made Jules’ API public, which it had previously used for internal development. The purpose of this is also to help developers use Jules more often as they can extend the tool into their existing workflows where they have “a lot of muscle memory and familiarity,” Korevec said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Developers can also use the API to integrate Jules with their integrated development environment (IDE), a software application that helps make coding easier by providing a list of tools, such as VSCode. However, Korevec told TechCrunch that her team is keen to build specific plugins for IDEs to further expand Jules’ presence.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest updates come just after Google introduced “memory” for Jules to keep a record of interactions with users and their preferences, nudges, and corrections. For the last few weeks, the tool has also added a list of other features, including a stacked layout for the diff viewer, image upload, and the ability to read and respond to comments on pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, another area Google is exploring with Jules is reducing its reliance on GitHub. Currently, the agent codes within a GitHub repository — requiring developers to either connect it to an existing repo or provide a blank one to work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Users want Jules to integrate with other code hosting providers,” said Korevec. “We are looking into how we can enable that with other version control systems. We are also looking into enabling it for people who don’t want a version control system, or they don’t care where their code is hosted.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Oversight of AI tools remains a challenge, especially when they are used in professional settings. Jules, however, is designed to notify the user if it gets stuck on a particular task, prompting them to step in and assist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If something happens where it runs into an issue, or it runs into a situation where it can’t unstick itself, it will pause and ask me a question,” Korevec said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, oversight becomes more difficult when users interact with Jules on mobile, as native notifications are not yet supported. Korevec noted that many users are already accessing Jules through its mobile web interface, and said Google is working to improve the mobile experience — particularly by exploring ways to offer native notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So far, Jules has primarily been used by software engineers and other professionals — unlike many vibe coding platforms that position themselves as go-to tools for non-coders. Still, some users are experimenting with Jules as a complement to more casual or creative coding environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We see a lot of people take that project that they have hit the limit in whatever vibe coding tool they’re using, and then bring that to Jules for further extending it,” Korevec told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Launched in public preview in May, Jules exited beta in August and is now available under structured pricing tiers. A free plan offers up to 15 individual daily tasks and three concurrent tasks. Higher limits are available through the Google AI Pro and Ultra plans, priced at $19.99 and $124.99 per month, offering approximately 5x and 20x the limits, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google is bringing its AI coding agent Jules deeper into developer workflows with a new command-line interface and public API, allowing it to plug into terminals, CI/CD systems, and tools like Slack — as competition intensifies among tech companies to own the future of software development and make coding more of an AI-assisted task.&lt;/p&gt;

On its first day, Sora saw 56,000 downloads, and is now ranked as the No. 3 Top Overall app on the U.S. App Store, according to new data from app intelligence provider Appfigures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm estimates Sora’s iOS app pulled in a total of 164,000 installs during its first two days, September 30th and October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The day-one figure puts Sora’s debut ahead of the performance of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and puts it on par with xAI’s Grok launch. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we’ll admit. It’s possible the new video app could have attracted even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; installs if it were open to all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite this restriction, it’s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers’ hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the chagrin of some at OpenAI, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity. But who’s to say that humanity isn’t benefiting from deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asking, “Are my piggies enjoying their slop?”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To compare Sora’s early success to other AI apps, Appfigures had to run an analysis that only looked at the other AI apps’ U.S. and Canadian downloads. That’s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and limited itself to U.S. users at the time, while Grok limited its iOS-only release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn’t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought its Claude app to iOS last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For a more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app’s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively. Sora tied with Grok for day-one installs, at 56,000. And it easily beat out the launches from AI apps Claude and Copilot. The former pulled in 21,000 day-one downloads, while the latter only saw 7,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sora also hit the U.S. App Store’s top charts, becoming the No. 3 overall top app by day two. For comparison, ChatGPT reached No. 1 on its second day, while Grok was No. 4, Gemini was No. 6, Copilot was No. 19, and Claude was No. 78. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-app-GettyImages2238161095.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI’s Sora app for AI videos is a viral hit, despite being invite-only for now and limited to users in the U.S. and Canada at launch.
