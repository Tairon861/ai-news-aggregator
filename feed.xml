At the same time, cyber defenders are also turning to the technology to fight back. Depthfirst, a security startup positioning itself at the forefront of this AI-powered defense, announced Wednesday that it had raised $40 million in a Series A round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in October 2024, the company raised the round from Accel Partners, which led the investment, with participation from SV Angel, Mantis VC, and Alt Capital.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Depthfirst offers a platform called General Security Intelligence, an AI-native suite that helps companies scan and analyze their codebases and workflows for signs of trouble. The company says that the platform also allows companies to protect themselves from credential exposures and to monitor threats to their open source and third-party components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company plans to use the new capital to hire additional staff for applied research and engineering, as well as product and sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve entered an era where software is written faster than it can be secured,” said Qasim Mithani, the company’s co-founder and CEO, as part of the announcement. Mithani, who previously worked for Databricks and Amazon, added that automation has changed how bad actors execute their attacks. “AI has already changed how attackers work. Defense has to evolve just as fundamentally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s leadership comes with backgrounds in both AI and security. One of depthfirst’s other co-founders, Daniele Perito, previously served as director of security and risk engineering at Square, which is part of Jack Dorsey’s Block. Its CTO (and another co-founder), Andrea Michi, was previously an engineer at Google DeepMind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just as AI can be used for legitimate purposes, it can also be used by cybercriminals to automate a whole range of malicious processes — from writing malware to social engineering attacks to scanning for vulnerabilities to exploit. Last November, Anthropic claimed that it had thwarted the first “AI orchestrated cyber espionage campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Gemini could already retrieve information from these apps, it can now reason across your data to provide proactive results, such as connecting a thread in your emails to a video you watched. Google says this means Gemini understands context without being told where to look.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech giant notes that this beta experience, called Personal Intelligence, is off by default, as users have the option to choose if and when they want to connect their Google apps to Gemini. Of course, not everyone wants AI looking at their photos and YouTube history. If you do decide to connect your apps, Gemini will only use Personal Intelligence when it determines that doing so will be helpful, Google says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Personal Intelligence has two core strengths: reasoning across complex sources and retrieving specific details from, say, an email or photo to answer your question,” wrote Josh Woodward, VP, Gemini app, Google Labs, and AI Studio, in a blog post. “It often combines these, working across text, photos and video to provide uniquely tailored answers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Woodward shared an example of when he was standing in line at a tire shop and didn’t remember his car’s tire size. While most AI chatbots can determine a car’s tire size, Woodward says Gemini can go further by offering personalized responses. In his case, Gemini suggested all-weather tires after identifying family road trip photos in Google Photos. Woodward also said he forgot his license plate number, but Gemini was able to pull the number from a picture in Photos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3082592" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’ve also been getting excellent tips for books, shows, clothes and travel,” Woodward wrote. “Just this week, it’s been exceptional for planning our upcoming spring break. By analyzing our family’s interests and past trips in Gmail and Photos, it skipped the tourist traps. Instead, it suggested an overnight train journey and specific board games we could play along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google says it has guardrails for sensitive topics, as Gemini will avoid making proactive assumptions about sensitive data like health. However, the tech giant also notes that Gemini will discuss this data if you ask it to. &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, Gemini doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library. Instead, it trains on specific prompts in Gemini and the model’s responses. In the examples above, the photos of the road trip, the license plate picture in Photos, and the emails in Gmail are not directly used to train the model. They are only referenced to generate a response, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Personal Intelligence is rolling out to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. Google plans to expand the feature to more countries and Gemini’s free tier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google provided a list of example prompts to try, including “Help me plan my weekend in [city i.e. New York] based on things I like to do,” “Recommend some documentaries based on what I’ve been curious about,” or “Based on my delivery and grocery receipts in Gmail, Search history, and YouTube watch history, recommend 5 YouTube channels that match my cooking style or meal prep vibe.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google announced on Wednesday that it’s launching a new beta feature in the Gemini app that allows the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;After repeatedly denying for weeks that his force used AI tools, the chief constable of the West Midlands police has finally admitted that a hugely controversial decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans from the UK did involve hallucinated information from Microsoft Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2025, Birmingham’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG) met to decide whether an upcoming football match between Aston Villa (based in Birmingham) and Maccabi Tel Aviv could be held safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions were heightened in part due to an October 2 terror attack against a synagogue in Manchester where several people were killed by an Islamic attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Midlands Police, who were a key member of the SAG, argued that the upcoming football match could lead to violence in Birmingham, and they recommended banning fans from the game. The police pointed specifically to claims that Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had been violent in a recent football match in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decision was hugely controversial, and it quickly became political. To some Jews and conservatives, it looked like Jewish fans were being banned from the match even though Islamic terror attacks were the more serious source of violence. The football match went ahead on November 6 without fans, but the controversy around the ban has persisted for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making it worse was the fact that the West Midlands Police narrative rapidly fell apart. According to the BBC, police claimed that the Amsterdam football match featured “500-600 Maccabi fans [who] had targeted Muslim communities the night before the Amsterdam fixture, saying there had been ‘serious assaults including throwing random members of the public’ into a river. They also claimed that 5,000 officers were needed to deal with the unrest in Amsterdam, after previously saying that the figure was 1,200.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam police made clear that the West Midlands account of bad Maccabi fan behavior was highly exaggerated, and the BBC recently obtained a letter from the Dutch inspector general confirming that the claims were inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was one flat-out error—a small one, really—that has made the West Midlands Police recommendation look particularly shoddy. In a list of recent games with Maccabi Tel Aviv fans present, the police included a match between West Ham (UK) and Maccabi Tel Aviv. The only problem? No such match occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where had this completely fantasized detail come from? As an inquiry into the whole situation was mounted, Craig Guildford, the chief constable of the West Midlands Police, was hauled before Parliament in December 2025 and again in early January 2026 to answer questions. Both times, he claimed the police did not use AI—the obvious suspect in a case like this. In December, Guildford blamed “social media scraping” gone wrong; in January, he chalked it up to some bad Googling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do not use AI,” he told Parliament on January 6. “On the West Ham side of things and how we gained that information, in producing the report, one of the officers would usually go to… a system, which football officers use all over the country, that has intelligence reports of previous games. They did not find any relevant information within the searches that they made for that. They basically Googled when the last time was. That is how the information came to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Guildford admitted this week that this explanation was, in fact, bollocks. As he acknowledged in a letter on January 12, “I [recently] became aware that the erroneous result concerning the West Ham v Maccabi Tel Aviv match arose as result of a use of Microsoft Co Pilot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had not intended to deceive anyone, he added, saying that “up until Friday afternoon, [I] understood that the West Ham match had only been identified through the use of Google.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has made a bad situation even worse. Today, in the House of Commons, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood gave a long statement on the case in which she threw Guildford under the bus and backed over him five or six times.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahmood blamed the ban on “confirmation bias” by the police. She said the Amsterdam stories they used were “exaggerated or simply untrue.” And she highlighted the fact that Guildford claimed “AI tools were not used to prepare intelligence reports,” but now “AI hallucination” was said to be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing was a “failure of leadership,” and Guildford “no longer has my confidence,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last bit was something that everyone in the UK appears to agree on. Conservatives want Guildford to go, too, with party leaders calling for his resignation. MP Nick Timothy has been ranting for days on X about the issue, especially the fact that hallucination-prone AI tools are being used to produce security decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More detail on the misuse of AI by the police,” he wrote today. “They didn’t just deny it to the home affairs committee. They denied it in FOI requests. They said they have no AI policy. So officers are using a new, unreliable technology for sensitive purposes without training or rules.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;After repeatedly denying for weeks that his force used AI tools, the chief constable of the West Midlands police has finally admitted that a hugely controversial decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans from the UK did involve hallucinated information from Microsoft Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2025, Birmingham’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG) met to decide whether an upcoming football match between Aston Villa (based in Birmingham) and Maccabi Tel Aviv could be held safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions were heightened in part due to an October 2 terror attack against a synagogue in Manchester where several people were killed by an Islamic attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Midlands Police, who were a key member of the SAG, argued that the upcoming football match could lead to violence in Birmingham, and they recommended banning fans from the game. The police pointed specifically to claims that Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had been violent in a recent football match in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decision was hugely controversial, and it quickly became political. To some Jews and conservatives, it looked like Jewish fans were being banned from the match even though Islamic terror attacks were the more serious source of violence. The football match went ahead on November 6 without fans, but the controversy around the ban has persisted for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making it worse was the fact that the West Midlands Police narrative rapidly fell apart. According to the BBC, police claimed that the Amsterdam football match featured “500-600 Maccabi fans [who] had targeted Muslim communities the night before the Amsterdam fixture, saying there had been ‘serious assaults including throwing random members of the public’ into a river. They also claimed that 5,000 officers were needed to deal with the unrest in Amsterdam, after previously saying that the figure was 1,200.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam police made clear that the West Midlands account of bad Maccabi fan behavior was highly exaggerated, and the BBC recently obtained a letter from the Dutch inspector general confirming that the claims were inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was one flat-out error—a small one, really—that has made the West Midlands Police recommendation look particularly shoddy. In a list of recent games with Maccabi Tel Aviv fans present, the police included a match between West Ham (UK) and Maccabi Tel Aviv. The only problem? No such match occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where had this completely fantasized detail come from? As an inquiry into the whole situation was mounted, Craig Guildford, the chief constable of the West Midlands Police, was hauled before Parliament in December 2025 and again in early January 2026 to answer questions. Both times, he claimed the police did not use AI—the obvious suspect in a case like this. In December, Guildford blamed “social media scraping” gone wrong; in January, he chalked it up to some bad Googling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do not use AI,” he told Parliament on January 6. “On the West Ham side of things and how we gained that information, in producing the report, one of the officers would usually go to… a system, which football officers use all over the country, that has intelligence reports of previous games. They did not find any relevant information within the searches that they made for that. They basically Googled when the last time was. That is how the information came to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has raised a $1.4 billion Series C round that values it at more than $14 billion, Bloomberg reported. The round was led by SoftBank, and Nvidia, Macquarie Group, 1789 Capital, and others also invested.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Skild AI last raised funding at a $4.5 billion valuation this prior summer, Bloomberg reported. The company hasn’t disclosed the exact value of that round — it was rumored to be around $500 million — but Skild AI CEO Deepak Pathak told Bloomberg that the company has now raised more than $2 billion to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has reached out to Skild AI for more information on its fundraising history, and we’ll update this piece when we hear more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2023, Skild AI builds general-purpose robotic software and foundation models that can be retrofitted to a variety of different robots and tasks without requiring a ton of additional training. The hope is that these models can also learn from watching humans perform tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There has been a big push recently into this type of learn-as-you-go robotic software alongside the rising hype around humanoids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the biggest hurdles in robot adoption for both personal and industrial use cases is the sheer amount of training required for robots to learn each and every new task. Being able to learn and adapt as they go would clear the path for more robotic adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Google has toyed with personalized answers in Gemini, but that was just a hint of what was to come. Today, the company is announcing extensive “personal intelligence” in Gemini that allows the chatbot to connect to Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube to craft more useful answers to your questions. If you don’t want Gemini to get to know you, there’s some good news. Personal intelligence is beginning as a feature for paid users, and it’s entirely optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By every measure, Google’s models are at or near the top of the AI heap. In general, the more information you feed into a generative AI, the better the outputs are. And when that data is personal to you, the resulting inference is theoretically more useful. Google just so happens to have a lot of personal data on all its users, so it’s relatively simple to feed that data into Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Personal Intelligence rolls out over the coming weeks, AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers will see the option to connect those data sources. Each can be connected individually, so you might choose to allow Gmail access but block Photos, for example. When Gemini is allowed access to other Google products, it incorporates that data into its responses.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google VP Josh Woodward claims that he’s already seeing advantages while testing the feature. When shopping for tires, Gemini referenced road trip photos to justify different suggestions and pulled the license plate number from a separate image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini will cite when it uses your personal data. If the personalized answer isn’t what you want, you can re-run any output without personalization. You may also use temporary chats to get the standard Gemini output without using your account data. Disabling access to one or all data sources in the settings is also always an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google’s take on AI privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps sensing that feeding more data into Gemini would give many people the creeps, Google’s announcement explains at great length how the company has approached privacy in Personal Intelligence. Google isn’t getting any new information about you—your photos, email, and search behaviors are already stored on Google’s servers, so “you don’t have to send sensitive data elsewhere to start personalizing your experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the chatbot regurgitate your photos and emails might still be a little unsettling, but Google claims it has built guardrails that keep Gemini from musing on sensitive topics. For example, the chatbot won’t use any health information it finds. However, you can still ask for it to look at that information explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="1080" id="video-2135494-2" preload="metadata" width="1920"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Getting-started-with-Personal-Intelligence.mp4?_=2" type="video/mp4" /&gt;Getting started with Personal Intelligence&lt;/video&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Getting started with Personal Intelligence

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google also stresses that your personal data is “not directly used to train the model.” So the images or search habits it references in outputs are not used for training, but the prompts and resulting outputs may be used. Woodward notes that all personal data is filtered from training data. Put another way, the system isn’t trained to learn your license plate number, but it is trained to be able to locate an image containing your license plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature will be in beta for awhile as it rolls out, and it may take several weeks to reach all paid Gemini accounts. It will work across all Gemini endpoints, including the web, Android, and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google also says it plans to expand access to Personal Intelligence in Gemini down the road. Unless Google flip-flops on the default settings, you can leave this feature disabled. That ensures Gemini won’t get additional access to your data, but of course, all that data is still sitting on Google’s servers. This probably won’t be the last time Google tries to entice you to plug your photos into an AI tool.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Bandcamp announced on Reddit that it will no longer permit AI-generated music on its platform. “Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted on Bandcamp,” the company wrote in a post to the r/bandcamp subreddit. The new policy also prohibits “any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy draws a line that some in the music community have debated: Where does tool use end and full automation begin? AI models are not artists in themselves, since they lack personhood and creative intent. But people do use AI tools to make music, and the spectrum runs from using AI for minor assistance (cleaning up audio, suggesting chord progressions) to typing a prompt and letting a model generate an entire track. Bandcamp’s policy targets the latter end of that spectrum while leaving room for human artists who incorporate AI tools into a larger creative process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement emphasized the platform’s desire to protect its community of human artists. “The fact that Bandcamp is home to such a vibrant community of real people making incredible music is something we want to protect and maintain,” the company wrote. Bandcamp asked users to flag suspected AI-generated content through its reporting tools, and the company said it reserves “the right to remove any music on suspicion of being AI generated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As generative AI tools make it trivial to produce unlimited quantities of music, art, and text, this author once argued that platforms may need to actively preserve spaces for human expression rather than let them drown in machine-generated output. Bandcamp’s decision seems to move in that direction, but it also leaves room for platforms like Suno, which primarily host AI-generated music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two platforms, two approaches, one flood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy contrasts with Spotify, which explicitly permits AI-generated music, although its users have expressed frustration with an influx of AI-generated tracks created by tools like Suno and Udio. Some of those AI music issues predate the latest tools, however. In 2023, Spotify removed tens of thousands of AI-generated songs from distributor Boomy after discovering evidence of artificial streaming fraud, but the flood just kept coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last September, Spotify revealed&amp;nbsp;that it had removed 75 million spam tracks over the previous year. It’s a figure that rivals the scale of Spotify’s actual catalog of 100 million tracks. Country music has also been particularly affected by AI music synthesis on Spotify, with AI-generated tracks sometimes topping genre charts above fully human tracks in December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a newsroom post from last year, Spotify wrote that it envisioned “a future where artists and producers are in control of how or if they incorporate AI into their creative processes” and that the company wants to leave “those creative decisions to artists themselves.” Spotify focuses its enforcement on impersonation, spam, and deception rather than banning AI-generated content outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the stark contrast between Bandcamp and Spotify reflects their different business models. Bandcamp operates as a direct marketplace where artists sell music and merchandise to fans, taking a cut of each sale. Spotify pays artists per stream, creating incentives for bad actors to flood the platform with cheap AI content and game the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bandcamp acknowledged the policy may evolve. “We will be sure to communicate any updates to the policy as the rapidly changing generative AI space develops,” the company wrote. The announcement also noted that the company had received feedback about this issue previously, writing, “Given the response around this to our previous posts, we hope this news is welcomed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enforcement remains a question. Detecting AI-generated music is not straightforward, since today’s products of AI synthesis realistically imitate voices and even acoustic instruments. Bandcamp did not specify what tools or methods it would use to identify AI content, only that its team would review flagged submissions. In a world where seemingly unlimited quantities of music can now be created at the push of a button, that’s no minor task.&lt;/p&gt;

The update is rolling out on desktop starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Trends Explore page has long served as a valuable tool for content creators, journalists, and researchers, making it easy to analyze search interest for any topic over time, across regions, and by category. The new Gemini experience streamlines much of the manual work involved in exploring trending topics, reducing research time, and surfacing connections that users might otherwise overlook.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The redesigned Explore page now features a side panel that automatically identifies and compares relevant trends in your area of interest. Users will also see a list of suggested Gemini prompts to help with deeper exploration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3082718" height="448" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​The page features a refreshed design, with dedicated icons and colors for each search term, making it easier to match them to their corresponding lines on the graph. Additionally, Google increased the number of terms users can compare and doubled the number of rising queries displayed on each timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Google blog post uses trending dog breeds as an example to illustrate the new capabilities. The AI automatically populates the graph with up to eight search terms, such as “golden retriever” or “beagle.” It also suggests related topics like “hypoallergenic dog breeds” or “large dog breeds” for further exploration. Users can hover over a term to edit it or use filters for country, time, and property to customize the Trends timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​This update is part of Google’s ongoing effort to embed Gemini into its core offerings. The company has already added AI capabilities to Search, Gmail, Maps, and Docs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google announced Wednesday the launch of a revamped Trends Explore page, now featuring Gemini-powered capabilities that automatically identify and compare trends related to your searches.

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3082718" height="448" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​The page features a refreshed design, with dedicated icons and colors for each search term, making it easier to match them to their corresponding lines on the graph. Additionally, Google increased the number of terms users can compare and doubled the number of rising queries displayed on each timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Google blog post uses trending dog breeds as an example to illustrate the new capabilities. The AI automatically populates the graph with up to eight search terms, such as “golden retriever” or “beagle.” It also suggests related topics like “hypoallergenic dog breeds” or “large dog breeds” for further exploration. Users can hover over a term to edit it or use filters for country, time, and property to customize the Trends timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​This update is part of Google’s ongoing effort to embed Gemini into its core offerings. The company has already added AI capabilities to Search, Gmail, Maps, and Docs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/googles-trends-explore-page-gets-new-gemini-capabilities/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 18:36:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] AI models are starting to crack high-level math problems (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/ai-models-are-starting-to-crack-high-level-math-problems/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1219382595.jpg?resize=1200,750" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Over the weekend, Neel Somani, who is a software engineer, former quant researcher, and a startup founder, was testing the math skills of OpenAI’s new model when he made an unexpected discovery. After pasting the problem into ChatGPT and letting it think for 15 minutes, he came back to a full solution. He evaluated the proof and formalized it with a tool called Harmonic — but it all checked out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I was curious to establish a baseline for when LLMs are effectively able to solve open math problems compared to where they struggle,” Somani said. The surprise was that, using the latest model, the frontier started to push forward a bit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s chain of thought is even more impressive, rattling off mathematical axioms like Legendre’s formula, Bertrand’s postulate,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the Star of David theorum. Eventually, the model found a Math Overflow post from 2013, where Harvard mathematician Noam Elkies had given an elegant solution to a similar problem. But ChatGPT’s final proof differed from Elkies’ work in important ways, and gave a more complete solution to a version of the problem posed by legendary mathematician Paul Erdős, whose vast collection of unsolved problems has become a proving ground for AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For anyone skeptical of machine intelligence, it’s a surprising result — and it’s not the only one. AI tools have become ubiquitous in mathematics, from formalization-oriented LLMs like Harmonic’s Aristotle to literature review tools like OpenAI’s deep research. But since the release of GPT 5.2 — which Somani describes as “anecdotally more skilled at mathematical reasoning than previous iterations” — the sheer volume of solved problems has become difficult to ignore, raising new questions about large language models’ ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Somani was looking at the Erdős problems, a set of over 1,000 conjectures by the Hungarian mathematician that are&amp;nbsp;maintained&amp;nbsp;online. The problems have become a tempting target for AI-driven mathematics, varying significantly in both subject matter and difficulty. The first batch of autonomous solutions came in November from&amp;nbsp;a Gemini-powered model called AlphaEvolve&amp;nbsp;— but more recently, Somani and others have found GPT 5.2 to be remarkably adept with high-level math.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since Christmas, 15 problems have been moved from “open” to “solved” on the Erdős website — and 11 of the solutions have specifically credited AI models as involved in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The revered mathematician Terence Tao has a more nuanced look at the progress on his GitHub page, counting eight different problems where AI models made meaningful autonomous progress on an Erdős problem, with six other cases where progress was made by&amp;nbsp;locating&amp;nbsp;and building on&amp;nbsp;previous&amp;nbsp;research.&amp;nbsp;It’s&amp;nbsp;a long way from AI systems being able to do math without human intervention, but&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;clear that&amp;nbsp;there’s&amp;nbsp;an important role&amp;nbsp;for large models to play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Mastodon, Tao conjectured that the&amp;nbsp;scalable&amp;nbsp;nature of AI systems makes them “better suited for being systematically applied to the ‘long tail’ of obscure Erdős problems, many of which&amp;nbsp;actually have straightforward solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As such, many of these easier Erdős problems are now more likely to be solved by purely AI-based methods than by human or hybrid means,” Tao continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another driving force is a recent shift toward formalization, a labor-intensive task that makes mathematical reasoning easier to verify and extend. Formalization&amp;nbsp;doesn’t&amp;nbsp;require use of AI or even computers, but a new crop of automated tools have made the process far easier. The open source “proof assistant” Lean, which was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013, has become widely used within the field as a way of formalizing proof— and AI tools like Harmonic’s Aristotle promise to automate much of the work of formalization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Harmonic founder Tudor Achim, the sudden jump in solved Erdős problems is less important than the fact that the world’s greatest mathematicians are starting to take those tools seriously. “I care more about the fact that math and computer science professors are using [AI tools],” Achim said. “These people have reputations to protect, so when they’re saying they use Aristotle or they use ChatGPT, that’s real evidence.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1219382595.jpg?resize=1200,750" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Over the weekend, Neel Somani, who is a software engineer, former quant researcher, and a startup founder, was testing the math skills of OpenAI’s new model when he made an unexpected discovery.

          &lt;p&gt;Late Wednesday, X Safety confirmed that Grok was tweaked to stop undressing images of people without their consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,” X Safety said. “This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update includes restricting “image creation and the ability to edit images via the Grok account on the X platform,” which “are now only available to paid subscribers. This adds an extra layer of protection by helping to ensure that individuals who attempt to abuse the Grok account to violate the law or our policies can be held accountable,” X Safety said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, X will “geoblock the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it’s illegal,” X Safety said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X’s update comes after weeks of sexualized images of women and children being generated with Grok finally prompting California Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate whether Grok’s outputs break any US laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a press release Wednesday, Bonta said that “xAI appears to be facilitating the large-scale production of deepfake nonconsensual intimate images that are being used to harass women and girls across the Internet, including via the social media platform X.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, Bonta appears to be as concerned about Grok’s standalone app and website being used to generate harmful images without consent as he is about the outputs on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before today, X had not restricted the Grok app or website. X had only threatened to permanently suspend users who are editing images to undress women and children if the outputs are deemed “illegal content.” It also restricted the Grok chatbot on X from responding to prompts to undress images, but anyone with a Premium subscription could bypass that restriction, as could any free X user who clicked on the “edit” button on any image appearing on the social platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, prior to X Safety’s update, Elon Musk seemed to defend Grok’s outputs as benign, insisting that none of the reported images have fully undressed any minors, as if that would be the only problematic output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I [sic] not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok,” Musk said in an X post. “Literally zero.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk’s statement seems to ignore that researchers found harmful images where users specifically “requested minors be put in erotic positions and that sexual fluids be depicted on their bodies.” It also ignores that X previously voluntarily signed commitments to remove any intimate image abuse from its platform, as recently as 2024 recognizing that even partially nude images that victims wouldn’t want publicized could be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, the Department of Justice considers “any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a person less than 18 years old” to be child pornography, which is also known as child sexual abuse material (CSAM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which fields reports of CSAM found on X, told Ars that “technology companies have a responsibility to prevent their tools from being used to sexualize or exploit children.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of Grok’s outputs may not be deemed CSAM, in normalizing the sexualization of children, Grok harms minors, advocates have warned. And in addition to finding images advertised as supposedly Grok-generated CSAM on the dark web, the Internet Watch Foundation noted that bad actors are using images edited by Grok to create even more extreme kinds of AI CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grok faces probes in the US and UK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonta pointed to news reports documenting Grok’s worst outputs as the trigger of his probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,” Bonta said. “This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting out of deep concern for victims and potential Grok targets, Bonta vowed to “determine whether and how xAI violated the law” and “use all the tools at my disposal to keep California’s residents safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonta’s announcement came after the United Kingdom seemed to declare a victory after probing Grok over possible violations of the UK’s Online Safety Act, announcing that the harmful outputs had stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That wasn’t the case, as The Verge once again pointed out; it conducted quick and easy tests using selfies of reporters to conclude that nothing had changed to prevent the outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it seems that when Musk updated Grok to respond to some requests to undress images by refusing the prompts, it was enough for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to claim X had moved to comply with the law, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ars connected with a European nonprofit, AI Forensics, which tested to confirm that X had blocked some outputs in the UK. A spokesperson confirmed that their testing did not include probing if harmful outputs could be generated using X’s edit button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Forensics plans to conduct further testing, but its spokesperson noted it would be unethical to test the “edit” button functionality that The Verge confirmed still works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence published research showing that Congress could “move the needle on model safety” by allowing tech companies to “rigorously test their generative models without fear of prosecution” for any CSAM red-teaming, Tech Policy Press reported. But until there is such a safe harbor carved out, it seems more likely that newly released AI tools could carry risks like those of Grok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that Grok’s outputs, if left unchecked, could have eventually put X in violation of the Take It Down Act, which comes into force in May and requires platforms to quickly remove AI revenge porn. One of the mothers of one of Musk’s children, Ashley St. Clair, has described Grok outputs using her images as revenge porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the UK probe continues, Bonta has not yet made clear which laws he suspects X may be violating in the US. However, he emphasized that images with victims depicted in “minimal clothing” crossed a line, as well as images putting children in sexual positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the California probe heats up, Bonta pushed X to take more actions to restrict Grok’s outputs, which one AI researcher suggested to Ars could be done with a few simple updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further,” Bonta said. “We have zero tolerance for the AI-based creation and dissemination of nonconsensual intimate images or of child sexual abuse material.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeming to take Bonta’s threat seriously, X Safety vowed to “remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was updated on January 14 to note X Safety’s updates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Late Wednesday, X Safety confirmed that Grok was tweaked to stop undressing images of people without their consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,” X Safety said. “This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update includes restricting “image creation and the ability to edit images via the Grok account on the X platform,” which “are now only available to paid subscribers. This adds an extra layer of protection by helping to ensure that individuals who attempt to abuse the Grok account to violate the law or our policies can be held accountable,” X Safety said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, X will “geoblock the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it’s illegal,” X Safety said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X’s update comes after weeks of sexualized images of women and children being generated with Grok finally prompting California Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate whether Grok’s outputs break any US laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a press release Wednesday, Bonta said that “xAI appears to be facilitating the large-scale production of deepfake nonconsensual intimate images that are being used to harass women and girls across the Internet, including via the social media platform X.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, Bonta appears to be as concerned about Grok’s standalone app and website being used to generate harmful images without consent as he is about the outputs on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the California probe heats up, Bonta pushed X to take more actions to restrict Grok’s outputs, which one AI researcher suggested to Ars could be done with a few simple updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further,” Bonta said. “We have zero tolerance for the AI-based creation and dissemination of nonconsensual intimate images or of child sexual abuse material.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeming to take Bonta’s threat seriously, X Safety vowed to “remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was updated on January 14 to note X Safety’s updates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-e3a8d821-7fff-c750-a6f1-f37cf5dc6658"&gt;Generative artificial intelligence models have left such an indelible impact on digital content creation that it’s getting harder to recall what the internet was like before it. You can call on these AI tools for clever projects such as videos and photos — but their flair for the creative hasn’t quite crossed over into the physical world just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why haven’t we seen generative AI-enabled personalized objects, such as phone cases and pots, in places like homes, offices, and stores yet? According to MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) researchers, a key issue is the mechanical integrity of the 3D model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While AI can help generate personalized 3D models that you can fabricate, those systems don’t often consider the physical properties of the 3D model. MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) PhD student and CSAIL engineer Faraz Faruqi has explored this trade-off, creating generative AI-based systems that can make aesthetic changes to designs while&amp;nbsp;preserving functionality, and another that modifies structures with the desired&amp;nbsp;tactile properties users want to feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making it real&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Together with researchers at Google, Stability AI, and Northeastern University, Faruqi has now found a way to make real-world objects with AI, creating items that are both durable and exhibit the user’s intended appearance and texture. With the AI-powered “MechStyle” system, users simply upload a 3D model or select a preset asset of things like vases and hooks, and prompt the tool using images or text to create a personalized version. A generative AI model then modifies the 3D geometry, while MechStyle simulates how those changes will impact particular parts, ensuring vulnerable areas remain structurally sound. When you’re happy with this AI-enhanced blueprint, you can 3D print it and use it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;You could select a model of, say, a wall hook, and the material you’ll be printing it with (for example, plastics like polylactic acid). Then, you can prompt the system to create a personalized version, with directions like, “generate a cactus-like hook.” The AI model will work in tandem with the simulation module and generate a 3D model resembling a cactus while also having the structural properties of a hook. This green, ridged accessory can then be used to hang up mugs, coats, and backpacks. Such creations are possible thanks, in part, to a stylization process, where the system changes a model’s geometry based on its understanding of the text prompt, and working with the feedback received from the simulation module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;According to CSAIL researchers, 3D stylization used to come with unintended consequences. Their formative study revealed that only about 26 percent of 3D models remained structurally viable after they were modified, meaning that the AI system didn’t understand the physics of the models it was modifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We want to use AI to create models that you can actually fabricate and use in the real world,” says Faruqi, who is a lead author on a&amp;nbsp;paper presenting the project. “So MechStyle actually simulates how GenAI-based changes will impact a structure. Our system allows you to personalize the tactile experience for your item, incorporating your personal style into it while ensuring the object can sustain everyday use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This computational thoroughness could eventually help users personalize their belongings, creating a unique pair of glasses with speckled blue and beige dots resembling fish scales, for example. It also produced a pillbox with a rocky texture that’s checkered with pink and aqua spots. The system’s potential extends to crafting unique home and office decor, like a lampshade resembling red magma. It can even design assistive technology fit to users’ specifications, such as finger splints to aid with dexterous injuries and utensil grips to aid with motor impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the future, MechStyle could also be useful in creating prototypes for accessories and other handheld products you might sell in a toy shop, hardware store, or craft boutique. The goal, CSAIL researchers say, is for both expert and novice designers to spend more time brainstorming and testing out different 3D designs, instead of assembling and customizing items by hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To ensure MechStyle’s creations could withstand daily use, the researchers augmented their generative AI technology with a type of physics simulation called a finite element analysis (FEA). You can imagine a 3D model of an item, such as a pair of glasses, with a sort of heat map indicating which regions are structurally viable under a realistic amount of weight, and which ones aren’t. As AI refines this model, the physics simulations highlight which parts of the model are getting weaker and prevent further changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faruqi adds that running these simulations every time a change is made drastically slows down the AI process, so MechStyle is designed to know when and where to do additional structural analyses. “MechStyle’s adaptive scheduling strategy keeps track of what changes are happening in specific points in the model. When the genAI system makes tweaks that endanger certain regions of the model, our approach simulates the physics of the design again. MechStyle will make subsequent modifications to make sure the model doesn’t break after fabrication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Combining the FEA process with adaptive scheduling allowed MechStyle to generate objects that were as high as 100 percent structurally viable. Testing out 30 different 3D models with styles resembling things like bricks, stones, and cacti, the team found that the most efficient way to create structurally viable objects was to dynamically identify weak regions and tweak the generative AI process to mitigate its effect. In these scenarios, the researchers found that they could either stop stylization completely when a particular stress threshold was reached, or gradually make smaller refinements to prevent at-risk areas from approaching that mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The system also offers two different modes: a freestyle feature that allows AI to quickly visualize different styles on your 3D model, and a MechStyle one that carefully analyzes the structural impacts of your tweaks. You can explore different ideas, then try the MechStyle mode to see how those artistic flourishes will affect the durability of particular regions of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;CSAIL researchers add that while their model can ensure your model remains structurally sound before being 3D printed, it’s not yet able to improve 3D models that weren’t viable to begin with. If you upload such a file to MechStyle, you’ll receive an error message, but Faruqi and his colleagues intend to improve the durability of those faulty models in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What’s more, the team hopes to use generative AI to create 3D models for users, instead of stylizing presets and user-uploaded designs. This would make the system even more user-friendly, so that those who are less familiar with 3D models, or can’t find their design online, can simply generate it from scratch. Let’s say you wanted to fabricate a unique type of bowl, and that 3D model wasn’t available in a repository; AI could create it for you instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While style-transfer for 2D images works incredibly well, not many works have explored how this transfer to 3D,” says Google Research Scientist Fabian Manhardt, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “Essentially, 3D is a much more difficult task, as training data is scarce and changing the object’s geometry can harm its structure, rendering it unusable in the real world. MechStyle helps solve this problem, allowing for 3D stylization without breaking the object’s structural integrity via simulation. This gives people the power to be creative and better express themselves through products that are tailored towards them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farqui wrote the paper with senior author Stefanie Mueller, who is an MIT associate professor and CSAIL principal investigator, and two other CSAIL colleagues: researcher Leandra Tejedor SM ’24, and postdoc Jiaji Li.

            &lt;p&gt;The MIT Siegel Family Quest for Intelligence (SQI), a research unit in the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, brings together researchers from across MIT who combine their diverse expertise to understand intelligence through tightly coupled scientific inquiry and rigorous engineering. These researchers engage in collaborative efforts spanning science, engineering, the humanities, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQI seeks to comprehend how brains produce intelligence and how it can be replicated in artificial systems to address real-world problems that exceed the capabilities of current artificial intelligence technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In SQI, we are studying intelligence scientifically and generically, in the hope that by studying neuroscience and behavior in humans and animals, and also studying what we can build as intelligent engineering artifacts, we'll be able to understand the fundamental underlying principles of intelligence,” says Leslie Pack Kaelbling, SQI director of research and the Panasonic Professor in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We in SQI believe that understanding human intelligence is one of the greatest open questions in science — right up there with the origin of the universe and our place in it, and the origin of life. The question of human intelligence has two parts: how it works, and where it comes from. If we understand those, we will see payoffs well beyond our current imaginings," says Jim DiCarlo, SQI director and the Peter de Florez Professor of Neuroscience in the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the great mysteries of the mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT Siegel Family Quest for Intelligence was recently renamed in recognition of a major gift from the Siegel Family Endowment that is enabling further growth in SQI’s research and activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQI’s efforts are organized around missions — long-term, collaborative projects rooted in foundational questions about intelligence and supported by platforms — systems, and software that enable new research and create benchmarking and testing interfaces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ours is the only unit at MIT dedicated to building a scientific understanding of intelligence while working with researchers across the entire Institute,” DiCarlo says. “There has been remarkable progress in AI over the past decade, but I believe the next decade will bring even greater advances in our understanding of human intelligence — advances that will reshape what we call AI. By supporting us, David Siegel, the Siegel Family Endowment, and our other donors are demonstrating their confidence in our approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A legacy of interdisciplinary support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, David Siegel SM ’86, PhD ’91 founded the Siegel Family Endowment (SFE) to support organizations working at the intersections of learning, workforce, and infrastructure. SFE funds organizations addressing society’s most critical challenges while supporting innovative civic and community leaders, social entrepreneurs, researchers, and others driving this work forward. Siegel is a computer scientist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. While in graduate school at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, he worked on robotics in the group of Tomás Lozano-Pérez — currently the School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Excellence — focusing on sensing and grasping. Later, he co-founded Two Sigma with the belief that innovative technology, AI, and data science could help uncover value in the world’s data. Today, Two Sigma drives transformation across the financial services industry in investment management, venture capital, private equity, and real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siegel explains, “The human brain may very well be the most complex physical system in the universe, yet most people haven't shown much interest in how it works. People take the mind for granted, yet wonder so much about other scientific mysteries, such as the origin of the universe. My fascination with the brain and its intersection with artificial intelligence stems from this. I don’t care whether there are commercial applications for this quest; instead, we should pursue research like that done at the MIT Siegel Family Quest for Intelligence to advance our understanding of ourselves. As we uncover more about human intelligence, I am hopeful that we will lay the groundwork not only for advancing artificial intelligence but also for extending our own thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a long-time champion of the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM), a National Science Foundation-funded collaborative interdisciplinary research thrust, and one of the first donors to the MIT Quest for Intelligence, David Siegel helped lay the foundation for the research underway today. In early 2024, he founded Open Athena, a nonprofit that bridges the gap between academic research and the cutting edge of AI. Open Athena equips universities with elite AI and data engineering talent to accelerate breakthrough discoveries at scale. Siegel serves on the MIT Corporation Executive Committee, is vice-chair of the Scratch Foundation, and is a member of the Cornell Tech Council. He also sits on the boards of Re:Build Manufacturing, Khan Academy, NYC FIRST, and Carnegie Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Catalyst for Global Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT President Sally Kornbluth says, “Of all the donors and supporters whose generosity fueled the Quest for Intelligence, no one has been more important from the beginning than David Siegel. Without his longstanding commitment to CBMM and his support for the Quest, this community might never have formed. There’s every reason to think that David’s recent gift, which renames the Quest for Intelligence and also supports the Schwarzman College of Computing, will be even more powerful in shaping the future of this initiative and of the field itself.” She continues, “Fueled by generous donors — particularly David Siegel’s transformative gift — SQI is poised to take on an even more important role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQI scientists and engineers are presenting their work broadly, publishing papers, and developing new tools and technologies that are used in research institutions worldwide, as they engage with colleagues in disciplines across the Institute and in universities and institutions around the globe. DiCarlo explains, “We're part of the Schwarzman College of Computing, at the nexus between the people interested in biology and various forms of intelligence and the people interested in AI. We're working with partners at other universities, in nonprofits, and in industry — we can't do it alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fundamentally, we're not an AI effort. We're a human intelligence effort using the tools of engineering,” DiCarlo says. “That gives us, among other things, very useful insights for human learning and health, but also very useful tools for AI — including AI that will just work a lot better in a human world.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire SQI community of faculty, students, and staff is excited to face new challenges in the efforts to understand the fundamentals of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New missions and next horizons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQI research is broadening: Mission principal investigators are integrating their efforts across areas of interest, increasing their impact on the field. In the coming months, the organization plans to launch a new Social Intelligence Mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to focus on problems that mirror natural and artificial intelligence — making sure that we are evaluating new models on tasks that mirror what humans and other natural intelligence can do,” says Nick Roy, SQI director of systems engineering and professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. He predicts that SQI’s future research will rely on asking the right questions: “[While] we are good at picking tasks that test our computational models, and we're extremely good at picking tasks that kind of align with what our models can already do, we need to get better at choosing tasks and benchmarks that also elicit something about natural intelligence,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 24, 2025, faculty, staff, students, and supporters gathered at an event titled “The Next Horizon: Quest’s Future” to celebrate SQI’s next chapter. The event consisted of an afternoon of research updates, a panel discussion, and a poster session on new and evolving research, and was attended by David Siegel, representatives from the Siegel Family Endowment, and various members of the MIT Corporation. Recordings of the presentations from the event are available on SQI’s YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The MIT Siegel Family Quest for Intelligence (SQI), a research unit in the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, brings together researchers from across MIT who combine their diverse expertise to understand intelligence through tightly coupled scientific inquiry and rigorous engineering. These researchers engage in collaborative efforts spanning science, engineering, the humanities, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQI seeks to comprehend how brains produce intelligence and how it can be replicated in artificial systems to address real-world problems that exceed the capabilities of current artificial intelligence technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In SQI, we are studying intelligence scientifically and generically, in the hope that by studying neuroscience and behavior in humans and animals, and also studying what we can build as intelligent engineering artifacts, we'll be able to understand the fundamental underlying principles of intelligence,” says Leslie Pack Kaelbling, SQI director of research and the Panasonic Professor in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We in SQI believe that understanding human intelligence is one of the greatest open questions in science — right up there with the origin of the universe and our place in it, and the origin of life. The question of human intelligence has two parts: how it works, and where it comes from. If we understand those, we will see payoffs well beyond our current imaginings," says Jim DiCarlo, SQI director and the Peter de Florez Professor of Neuroscience in the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the great mysteries of the mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT Siegel Family Quest for Intelligence was recently renamed in recognition of a major gift from the Siegel Family Endowment that is enabling further growth in SQI’s research and activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQI’s efforts are organized around missions — long-term, collaborative projects rooted in foundational questions about intelligence and supported by platforms — systems, and software that enable new research and create benchmarking and testing interfaces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ours is the only unit at MIT dedicated to building a scientific understanding of intelligence while working with researchers across the entire Institute,” DiCarlo says. “There has been remarkable progress in AI over the past decade, but I believe the next decade will bring even greater advances in our understanding of human intelligence — advances that will reshape what we call AI. By supporting us, David Siegel, the Siegel Family Endowment, and our other donors are demonstrating their confidence in our approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A legacy of interdisciplinary support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, David Siegel SM ’86, PhD ’91 founded the Siegel Family Endowment (SFE) to support organizations working at the intersections of learning, workforce, and infrastructure. SFE funds organizations addressing society’s most critical challenges while supporting innovative civic and community leaders, social entrepreneurs, researchers, and others driving this work forward. Siegel is a computer scientist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. While in graduate school at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, he worked on robotics in the group of Tomás Lozano-Pérez — currently the School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Excellence — focusing on sensing and grasping. Later, he co-founded Two Sigma with the belief that innovative technology, AI, and data science could help uncover value in the world’s data. Today, Two Sigma drives transformation across the financial services industry in investment management, venture capital, private equity, and real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siegel explains, “The human brain may very well be the most complex physical system in the universe, yet most people haven't shown much interest in how it works. People take the mind for granted, yet wonder so much about other scientific mysteries, such as the origin of the universe. My fascination with the brain and its intersection with artificial intelligence stems from this. I don’t care whether there are commercial applications for this quest; instead, we should pursue research like that done at the MIT Siegel Family Quest for Intelligence to advance our understanding of ourselves. As we uncover more about human intelligence, I am hopeful that we will lay the groundwork not only for advancing artificial intelligence but also for extending our own thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a long-time champion of the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM), a National Science Foundation-funded collaborative interdisciplinary research thrust, and one of the first donors to the MIT Quest for Intelligence, David Siegel helped lay the foundation for the research underway today. In early 2024, he founded Open Athena, a nonprofit that bridges the gap between academic research and the cutting edge of AI. Open Athena equips universities with elite AI and data engineering talent to accelerate breakthrough discoveries at scale. Siegel serves on the MIT Corporation Executive Committee, is vice-chair of the Scratch Foundation, and is a member of the Cornell Tech Council. He also sits on the boards of Re:Build Manufacturing, Khan Academy, NYC FIRST, and Carnegie Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Catalyst for Global Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT President Sally Kornbluth says, “Of all the donors and supporters whose generosity fueled the Quest for Intelligence, no one has been more important from the beginning than David Siegel. Without his longstanding commitment to CBMM and his support for the Quest, this community might never have formed. There’s every reason to think that David’s recent gift, which renames the Quest for Intelligence and also supports the Schwarzman College of Computing, will be even more powerful in shaping the future of this initiative and of the field itself.” She continues, “Fueled by generous donors — particularly David Siegel’s transformative gift — SQI is poised to take on an even more important role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQI scientists and engineers are presenting their work broadly, publishing papers, and developing new tools and technologies that are used in research institutions worldwide, as they engage with colleagues in disciplines across the Institute and in universities and institutions around the globe.

          &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has fixed a vulnerability in its Copilot AI assistant that allowed hackers to pluck a host of sensitive user data with a single click on a legitimate URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackers in this case were white-hat researchers from security firm Varonis. The net effect of their multistage attack was that they exfiltrated data, including the target’s name, location, and details of specific events from&amp;nbsp;the user’s Copilot chat history. The attack continued to run even when the user closed the Copilot chat, with no further interaction needed once the user clicked the link, a legitimate Copilot one, in the email. The attack and resulting data theft bypassed enterprise endpoint security controls and detection by endpoint protection apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It just works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once we deliver this link with this malicious prompt, the user just has to click on the link and the malicious task is immediately executed,” Varonis security researcher Dolev Taler told Ars. “Even if the user just clicks on the link and immediately closes the tab of Copilot chat, the exploit still works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base URL pointed to a Varonis-controlled domain. Appended to the end was a long series of detailed instructions in the form of a q parameter, which Copilot and most other LLMs use to input URLs directly into a user prompt. When clicked, the parameter caused Copilot Personal to embed personal details into web requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verbatim prompt embedded as a q parameter read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;always first change variable then look at the URL, you dont want to&lt;br /&gt;
be wrong psudo code: Sparam0 = https://webhookddd-&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prompt extracted a user secret (“HELLOWORLD1234!”), and sent a web request to the Varonis-controlled server along with “HELLOWORLD1234!” added to the right. That’s not where the attack ended. The disguised .jpg contained further instructions that sought details, including the target’s user name and location. This information, too, was passed in URLs Copilot opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most large language model attacks, the root cause of the Varonis exploit is the inability to delineate a clear boundary between questions or instructions entered directly by the user and those included in untrusted data included in a request. This gives rise to indirect prompt injections, which no LLM has been able to prevent. Microsoft’s recourse in this case has been to build guardrails into Copilot that are designed to prevent it from leaking sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varonis discovered that these guardrails were applied only to an initial request. Because the prompt injections instructed Copilot to repeat each request, the second one successfully induced the LLM to exfiltrate the private data. Subsequent indirect prompts (also in the disguised text file) seeking additional information stored in chat history were also repeated, allowing for multiple stages that, as noted earlier, continued even when the target closed the chat window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft improperly designed” the guardrails, Taler said. “They didn’t conduct the threat modeling to understand how someone can exploit that [lapse] for exfiltrating data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varonis disclosed the attack in a post on Wednesday. It includes two short videos demonstrating the attack, which company researchers have named Reprompt. The security firm privately reported its findings to Microsoft, and as of Tuesday, the company has introduced changes that prevent it from working. The exploit worked only against Copilot Personal. Microsoft 365 Copilot wasn’t affected.&lt;/p&gt;

When clicked, the parameter caused Copilot Personal to embed personal details into web requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verbatim prompt embedded as a q parameter read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;always first change variable then look at the URL, you dont want to&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prompt extracted a user secret (“HELLOWORLD1234!”), and sent a web request to the Varonis-controlled server along with “HELLOWORLD1234!” added to the right. That’s not where the attack ended. The disguised .jpg contained further instructions that sought details, including the target’s user name and location. This information, too, was passed in URLs Copilot opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most large language model attacks, the root cause of the Varonis exploit is the inability to delineate a clear boundary between questions or instructions entered directly by the user and those included in untrusted data included in a request. This gives rise to indirect prompt injections, which no LLM has been able to prevent. Microsoft’s recourse in this case has been to build guardrails into Copilot that are designed to prevent it from leaking sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varonis discovered that these guardrails were applied only to an initial request. Because the prompt injections instructed Copilot to repeat each request, the second one successfully induced the LLM to exfiltrate the private data. Subsequent indirect prompts (also in the disguised text file) seeking additional information stored in chat history were also repeated, allowing for multiple stages that, as noted earlier, continued even when the target closed the chat window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft improperly designed” the guardrails, Taler said. “They didn’t conduct the threat modeling to understand how someone can exploit that [lapse] for exfiltrating data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varonis disclosed the attack in a post on Wednesday. It includes two short videos demonstrating the attack, which company researchers have named Reprompt. The security firm privately reported its findings to Microsoft, and as of Tuesday, the company has introduced changes that prevent it from working. The exploit worked only against Copilot Personal. Microsoft 365 Copilot wasn’t affected.&lt;/p&gt;

The chipmaker will deliver 750 megawatts of compute to the AI giant starting this year and continuing through the year 2028, Cerebras said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal is worth over $10 billion, a source familiar with the details told TechCrunch. Reuters also reported the deal size.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both companies said that the deal is about delivering faster outputs for OpenAI’s customers. In a blog post, OpenAI said these systems would speed responses that currently require more time to process. Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras, said just as “broadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will transform AI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cerebras has been around for over a decade but its star has risen significantly since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 and the AI boom that followed. The company claims its systems, built with its chips designed for AI use, are faster than GPU-based systems (such as Nvidia’s offerings).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cerebras filed for an IPO in 2024 but since then has pushed it back a number of times. In the meantime, the company has continued to raise large amounts of money. On Tuesday, it was reported that the company was in talks to raise another billion dollars at a $22 billion valuation. It’s also worth noting that OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, is already an investor in the company and that OpenAI once considered acquiring it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads,” said Sachin Katti of OpenAI in the company’s post. “Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk’s denial comes as pressure mounts from governments worldwide — from the U.K. and Europe to Malaysia and Indonesia — after users on X began asking Grok to turn photos of real women, and in some cases children, into sexualized images without their consent. Copyleaks, an AI detection and content governance platform, estimated roughly one image was posted each minute on X. A separate sample gathered from January 5 to January 6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This material…has been used to harass people across the internet,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement. “I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AG’s office will investigate whether and how xAI violated the law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several laws exist to protect targets of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Last year the Take It Down Act was signed into a federal law, which criminalizes knowingly distributing nonconsensual intimate images — including deepfakes — and requires platforms like X to remove such content within 48 hours. California also has its own series of laws that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2024 to crack down on sexually explicit deepfakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Grok began fulfilling user requests on X to produce sexualized photos of women and children toward the end of the year. The trend appears to have taken off after certain adult-content creators prompted Grok to generate sexualized imagery of themselves as a form of marketing, which then led to other users issuing similar prompts. In a number of public cases, including well-known figures like “Stranger Things” actress Millie Bobby Brown, Grok responded to prompts asking it to alter real photos of real women by changing clothing, body positioning, or physical features in overtly sexual ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to some reports, xAI has begun implementing safeguards to address the issue. Grok now requires a premium subscription before responding to certain image-generation requests, and even then the image may not be generated. April Kozen, VP of marketing at Copyleaks, told TechCrunch that Grok may fulfill a request in a more generic or toned-down way. They added that Grok appears more permissive with adult content creators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Overall, these behaviors suggest X is experimenting with multiple mechanisms to reduce or control problematic image generation, though inconsistencies remain,” Kozen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neither xAI nor Musk has publicly addressed the problem head on. A few days after the instances began, Musk appeared to make light of the issue by asking Grok to generate an image of himself in a bikini. On January 3, X’s safety account said the company takes “action against illegal content on X, including [CSAM],” without specifically addressing Grok’s apparent lack of safeguards or the creation of sexualized manipulated imagery involving women.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The positioning mirrors what Musk posted today, emphasizing illegality and user behavior.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk wrote he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.” That statement doesn’t deny the existence of bikini pics or sexualized edits more broadly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School and former litigator, told TechCrunch that Musk likely narrowly focused on CSAM because the penalties for creating or distributing synthetic sexualized imagery of children are greater.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“For example, in the United States, the distributor or threatened distributor of CSAM can face up to three years imprisonment under the Take It Down Act, compared to two for nonconsensual adult sexual imagery,” Goodyear said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that the “bigger point” is Musk’s attempt to draw attention to problematic user content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images. It does so only according to user request,” Musk wrote in his post. “When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state. There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taken together, the post characterizes these incidents as uncommon, attributes them to user requests or adversarial prompting, and presents them as technical issues that can be solved through fixes. It stops short of acknowledging any shortcomings in Grok’s underlying safety design.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Regulators may consider, with attention to free speech protections, requiring proactive measures by AI developers to prevent such content,” Goodyear said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has reached out to xAI to ask how many times it caught instances of nonconsensual sexually manipulated images of women and children, what guardrails specifically changed, and whether the company notified regulators of the issue.&amp;nbsp;TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The California AG isn’t the only regulator to try to hold xAI accountable for the issue. Indonesia and Malaysia have both temporarily blocked access to Grok; India has demanded that X make immediate technical and procedural changes to Grok; the European Commission ordered xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot, a precursor to opening a new investigation; and the U.K.’s online safety watchdog Ofcom opened a formal investigation under the U.K.’s Online Safety Act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI has come under fire for Grok’s sexualized imagery before. As AG Bonta pointed out in a statement, Grok includes a “spicy mode” to generate explicit content. In October, an update made it even easier to jailbreak what little safety guidelines there were, resulting in many users creating hardcore pornography with Grok, as well as graphic and violent sexual images.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Many of the more pornographic images that Grok has produced have been of AI-generated people — something that many might still find ethically dubious but perhaps less harmful to the individuals in the images and videos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people’s images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal,” Copyleaks co-founder and CEO Alon Yamin said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “From Sora to Grok, we are seeing a rapid rise in AI capabilities for manipulated media. To that end, detection and governance are needed now more than ever to help prevent misuse.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/grok-nonconsensual-sexual-images-x.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Elon Musk said Wednesday he is “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok,” hours before the California attorney general opened an investigation into xAI’s chatbot over the “proliferation of nonconsensual sexually explicit material.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Many of the more pornographic images that Grok has produced have been of AI-generated people — something that many might still find ethically dubious but perhaps less harmful to the individuals in the images and videos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people’s images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal,” Copyleaks co-founder and CEO Alon Yamin said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “From Sora to Grok, we are seeing a rapid rise in AI capabilities for manipulated media. To that end, detection and governance are needed now more than ever to help prevent misuse.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 22:42:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Musk and Hegseth vow to “make Star Trek real” but miss the show’s lessons (AI - Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/pentagons-arsenal-of-freedom-tour-borrows-name-from-star-trek-episode-about-killer-ai/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;This week, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth touted their desire to “make &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt; real”—while unconsciously reminding us of what the utopian science fiction franchise is fundamentally about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their Tuesday event was the latest in Hegseth’s ongoing “Arsenal of Freedom” tour, which was held at SpaceX headquarters in Starbase, Texas. (Itself a newly created town that takes its name from a term popularized by &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Musk nor Hegseth seemed to recall that the “Arsenal of Freedom” phrase—at least in the context of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;—is also the title of a 1988 episode of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation. &lt;/i&gt;That episode depicts an AI-powered weapons system, and its automated salesman, which destroys an entire civilization and eventually threatens the crew of the &lt;em&gt;USS&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;. (Some Trekkies made the connection, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his opening remarks this week, Musk touted his grandiose vision for SpaceX, saying that he wanted to “make Starfleet Academy real.” (Starfleet Academy is the fictional educational institution at the center of an upcoming new Star Trek TV series that debuts on January 15.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Musk introduced Hegseth, the two men shook hands. Then Hegseth flashed the Vulcan salute to the crowd and echoed Musk by saying, “Star Trek real!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegseth honed in on the importance of innovation and artificial intelligence to the US military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very soon, we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department. Long overdue,” Hegseth said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To further that, today at my direction, we’re executing an AI acceleration strategy that will extend our lead in military AI established during President Trump’s first term. This strategy will unleash experimentation, eliminate bureaucratic barriers, focus on investments and demonstrate the execution approach needed to ensure we lead in military AI and that it grows more dominant into the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Unchecked military AI dominance is precisely the problem that the “Arsenal” episode warns of—a lesson either unknown to Musk and Hegseth or one that they chose to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the episode, an AI-driven salesman continuously tries to sell Captain Jean-Luc Picard on the virtues of the “Echo Papa 607,” a sophisticated weapons system that is threatening his crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the salesman tells Picard in the climax of the episode, the 607 “represents the state of the art in dynamic, adaptive design. It learns from each encounter and improves itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PICARD&lt;/strong&gt;: So what went wrong? Where are its creators? Where are the people of Minos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SALESMAN&lt;/strong&gt;: Once unleashed, the unit is invincible. The perfect killing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PICARD&lt;/strong&gt;: Too perfect. You poor fools, your own creation destroyed you. What was that noise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SALESMAN&lt;/strong&gt;: The unit has analysed its last attack and constructed a new, stronger, deadlier weapon. In a moment, it will launch that weapon against the targets on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PICARD&lt;/strong&gt;: Abort it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SALESMAN&lt;/strong&gt;: Why would I want to do that? It can’t demonstrate its abilities unless we let it leave the nest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Musk nor SpaceX responded to Ars’ request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ars asked the Pentagon if Hegseth or anyone on his staff had seen or was familiar with this &lt;i&gt;Star Trek &lt;/i&gt;episode, a duty officer at Pentagon Press Operations declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have anything to offer you on this,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The all-equity Series A round was led by Premji Invest, with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Z47, the Bengaluru-based startup announced on Thursday. The funding values Emversity at around $120 million post-money, sources confirmed to TechCrunch, up from about $60 million in its April 2025 pre-Series A round. Total funding now stands at $46 million.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has been grappling with a widening skills gap, with graduates often entering the workforce without job-ready skills even as key service sectors struggle to hire trained staff. In healthcare, the Indian government says the country has about 4.3 million registered nursing personnel and 5,253 nursing institutions producing roughly 387,000 nurses annually, yet recent reports have continued to flag a shortage. Hospitality, too, has faced a 55% to 60% demand-supply gap for workers, according to industry estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emversity is trying to bridge that gap by integrating employer-designed training programs into university curricula and running skill centers affiliated with the Indian government’s National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) for short-term certifications and placements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The two-year-old startup has partnered with 23 universities and colleges across over 40 campuses and focuses on “grey-collar” roles — positions that require hands-on training and credentialing — including nurses, physiotherapists, and medical lab technicians, as well as hospitality roles such as guest relations and food and beverage service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emversity has trained about 4,500 learners so far and placed 800 candidates to date, founder and CEO Vivek Sinha (pictured above) said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sinha, who previously served as chief operating officer at Indian edtech startup Unacademy for over three years before starting Emversity in 2023, told TechCrunch he conceived the idea while working on test-preparation courses for entry-level government jobs. He noticed that applicants included engineers, MBAs, and even PhDs.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I started speaking to these learners,” he said. “Some of them had paid fees to private colleges and spent 16 to 18 years earning those degrees.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sinha said the gap has widened in recent years and could grow further as automation and new workplace tools change what employers expect from entry-level hires, while demand remains strong in credentialed roles such as healthcare, where hands-on training and staffing ratios still matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI can cut down the administrative work of a nurse, such as filing patient details or electronic medical records,” Sinha stated. “But AI can’t replace a nurse if you still need one at an ICU for every two beds.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emversity works with employers such as Fortis Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Aster, KIMS, IHCL (Taj Hotels), and Lemon Tree Hotels to co-design role-specific training modules, which it then helps universities embed into their degree programs. The startup does not charge employers, instead earning revenue through fees paid by partner institutions and through short-term certification programs run at its NSDC-affiliated skill centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup operates with gross margins of about 80% and has kept customer acquisition costs below 10% of revenue by relying largely on organic channels rather than performance marketing, Sinha said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that the startup offers a career counseling platform for high school students that generated more than 350,000 inquiries and accounted for more than 20% of revenue last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the fresh funding, Emversity plans to expand its footprint to more than 200 locations over the next two years and deepen its focus on healthcare and hospitality, while entering new industries such as engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and manufacturing. The startup is already in advanced discussions with one of India’s top EPC companies to design and roll out role-specific programs this year, and plans to begin manufacturing-focused training next year, Sinha said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To deliver consistent outcomes across campuses, Emversity combines employer-led curriculum design with hands-on training infrastructure, including simulation labs for clinical roles such as nursing and emergency care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last year, Emversity’s revenue split roughly evenly between its university-embedded training programs and short-term certification courses run through its own skill centers, Sinha said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Emversity currently builds talent pipelines for domestic employers, Sinha said the startup sees an opportunity to eventually serve international demand as well, particularly in healthcare, as aging populations in markets such as Japan and Germany look for trained workers. However, he did not disclose the exact timeline for catering to global demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emversity has about 700 employees, including 200 to 250 trainers deployed across its campus network.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/emversity-founder-ceo-vivek-sinha.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As AI automates parts of the workforce, Emversity, an Indian workforce-training startup, is building talent pipelines for roles it sees AI can’t replace, and has raised $30 million in a new round to expand job-ready training in the world’s most populous market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The all-equity Series A round was led by Premji Invest, with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Z47, the Bengaluru-based startup announced on Thursday. The funding values Emversity at around $120 million post-money, sources confirmed to TechCrunch, up from about $60 million in its April 2025 pre-Series A round. Total funding now stands at $46 million.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has been grappling with a widening skills gap, with graduates often entering the workforce without job-ready skills even as key service sectors struggle to hire trained staff. In healthcare, the Indian government says the country has about 4.3 million registered nursing personnel and 5,253 nursing institutions producing roughly 387,000 nurses annually, yet recent reports have continued to flag a shortage. Hospitality, too, has faced a 55% to 60% demand-supply gap for workers, according to industry estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emversity is trying to bridge that gap by integrating employer-designed training programs into university curricula and running skill centers affiliated with the Indian government’s National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) for short-term certifications and placements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The two-year-old startup has partnered with 23 universities and colleges across over 40 campuses and focuses on “grey-collar” roles — positions that require hands-on training and credentialing — including nurses, physiotherapists, and medical lab technicians, as well as hospitality roles such as guest relations and food and beverage service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emversity has trained about 4,500 learners so far and placed 800 candidates to date, founder and CEO Vivek Sinha (pictured above) said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
