&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bloomberg reports that both Meta and Microsoft are asking for federal approval to trade power (Apple has already received this approval). According to Meta, this will allow it to make long-term commitments to buy electricity from new plants, while mitigating the risk by having the ability to resell some of that power on wholesale power markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Waymo already operates in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles (and outside California as well, in Atlanta, Austin, and Phoenix). But maps published by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles showed that the company can now test and deploy its autonomous vehicles across a much larger area in both the Bay Area and Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the Bay Area, Waymo’s approved areas of operation now include most of the East Bay and North Bay (including Napa/Wine Country), as well as Sacramento. In Southern California, the company’s approved territory now stretches from Santa Clarita (north of Los Angeles) to San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company will need additional regulatory approval before it can carry paying passengers in some of these regions, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Waymo’s post doesn’t offer many details about when it plans to actually start offering rides in all these new areas, the company wrote, “Next stop: welcoming riders in San Diego in mid-2026!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company had previously announced its intention to launch in San Diego next year, along with Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s been plenty of Waymo expansion news in the past couple weeks, as the company announced that it will be entering Minneapolis, New Orleans, and Tampa; is removing safety drivers ahead of its commercial launch in Miami; and will start offering rides that use freeways in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We discussed the growth of Waymo and other robotaxi companies on the latest episode of the Equity podcast.

In high-stakes domains like finance, medicine or autonomous systems, such unreliability is unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;b&gt;Lean4&lt;/b&gt;, an open-source programming language and interactive theorem prover becoming a key tool to inject rigor and certainty into AI systems. By leveraging formal verification, Lean4 promises to make AI safer, more secure and deterministic in its functionality. Let&amp;#x27;s explore how Lean4 is being adopted by AI leaders and why it could become foundational for building trustworthy AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is Lean4 and why it matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lean4 is both a programming language and a proof assistant designed for formal verification. Every theorem or program written in Lean4 must pass a strict type-checking by Lean’s trusted kernel, yielding a binary verdict: A statement either checks out as correct or it doesn’t. This all-or-nothing verification means there’s no room for ambiguity – a property or result is proven true or it fails. Such rigorous checking “&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2505.05758v3#:~:text=and%20an%20ITP,to%20natural%20language%20logical%20reasoning"&gt;dramatically increases the reliability&lt;/a&gt;” of anything formalized in Lean4. In other words, Lean4 &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/from-shiny-object-to-sober-reality-the-vector-database-story-two-years-later"&gt;provides a framework&lt;/a&gt; where correctness is mathematically guaranteed, not just hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This level of certainty is precisely what today’s AI systems lack. Modern AI outputs are generated by complex neural networks with probabilistic behavior. Ask the same question twice and you might get different answers. By contrast, a Lean4 proof or program will behave deterministically – given the same input, it produces the same verified result every time. This determinism and transparency (every inference step can be audited) make Lean4 an appealing antidote to AI’s unpredictability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key advantages of Lean4’s formal verification&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Precision and reliability:&lt;/b&gt; Formal proofs avoid ambiguity through strict logic, ensuring each reasoning step is valid and results are correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Systematic verification:&lt;/b&gt; Lean4 can formally verify that a solution meets all specified conditions or axioms, acting as an objective referee for correctness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency and reproducibility:&lt;/b&gt; Anyone can independently check a Lean4 proof, and the outcome will be the same – a stark contrast to the opaque reasoning of neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, Lean4 brings the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2505.05758v3#:~:text=and%20an%20ITP,to%20natural%20language%20logical%20reasoning"&gt;gold standard of mathematical rigor&lt;/a&gt; to computing and AI. It enables us to turn an AI’s claim (“I found a solution”) into a formally checkable proof that is indeed correct. This capability is proving to be a game-changer in several aspects of AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lean4 as a safety net for LLMs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting intersections of Lean4 and AI is in improving LLM accuracy and safety. &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/6-proven-lessons-from-the-ai-projects-that-broke-before-they-scaled"&gt;Research groups&lt;/a&gt; and startups are now combining LLMs’ natural language prowess with Lean4’s formal checks to create AI systems that reason correctly by construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the problem of AI hallucinations, when an AI confidently asserts false information. Instead of adding more opaque patches (like heuristic penalties or reinforcement tweaks), why not prevent hallucinations by having the AI prove its statements? That’s exactly what some recent efforts do. For example, a 2025 research framework called &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04592#:~:text=limiting%20their%20effectiveness,proving%20with%20%2430%2C809%24%20formal%20statements"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Safe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; uses Lean4 to verify each step of an LLM’s reasoning. The idea is simple but powerful: Each step in the AI’s chain-of-thought (CoT) translates the claim into Lean4’s formal language and the AI (or a proof assistant) provides a proof. If the proof fails, the system knows the reasoning was flawed – a clear indicator of a hallucination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step-by-step formal audit trail dramatically improves reliability, catching mistakes as they happen and providing &lt;a href="https://quantumzeitgeist.com/large-language-models-verified-with-formal-mathematics-reduce-hallucinations/#:~:text=from%20Huawei%20Noah%E2%80%99s%20Ark%20Lab,step%20correctness"&gt;checkable evidence&lt;/a&gt; for every conclusion. The approach that has shown “significant performance improvement while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence” of correctness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another prominent example is Harmonic AI, a startup co-founded by Vlad Tenev (of Robinhood fame) that tackles hallucinations in AI. Harmonic’s system, Aristotle, solves math problems by generating Lean4 proofs for its answers and formally verifying them before responding to the user. “[Aristotle] formally verifies the output… we actually do guarantee that there’s no hallucinations,” &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/harmonic-the-robinhood-ceos-ai-math-startup-launches-an-ai-chatbot-app/#:~:text=formally%20verifies%20the%20output%2C%E2%80%9D%20said,%E2%80%9D"&gt;Harmonic’s CEO explains&lt;/a&gt;. In practical terms, Aristotle writes a solution in Lean4’s language and runs the Lean4 checker. Only if the proof checks out as correct does it present the answer. This yields a “hallucination-free” math chatbot – a bold claim, but one backed by Lean4’s deterministic proof checking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, this method isn’t limited to toy problems. Harmonic reports that Aristotle achieved a gold-medal level performance on the 2025 International Math Olympiad problems, the key difference that its solutions were formally verified, unlike other AI models that merely gave answers in English. In other words, where tech giants Google and OpenAI also reached human-champion level on math questions, Aristotle did so with a proof in hand. The takeaway for AI safety is compelling: When an answer comes with a Lean4 proof, you don’t have to trust the AI – you can check it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could be extended to many domains. We could imagine an &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/large-reasoning-models-almost-certainly-can-think"&gt;LLM assistant&lt;/a&gt; for finance that provides an answer only if it can generate a formal proof that it adheres to accounting rules or legal constraints. Or, an AI scientific adviser that outputs a hypothesis alongside a Lean4 proof of consistency with known physics laws. The pattern is the same – Lean4 acts as a rigorous safety net, filtering out incorrect or unverified results. As one AI researcher from &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04592#:~:text=limiting%20their%20effectiveness,also%20propose%20%24FormalStep%24%20as%20a"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Safe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; put it, “the gold standard for supporting a claim is to provide a proof,” and now AI can attempt exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building secure and reliable systems with Lean4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lean4’s value isn’t confined to pure reasoning tasks; it’s also poised to revolutionize software security and reliability in the age of AI. Bugs and vulnerabilities in software are essentially small logic errors that slip through human testing. What if AI-assisted programming could eliminate those by using Lean4 to verify code correctness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In formal methods circles, it’s well known that provably correct code can “&lt;a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rWkGFmnSNl#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20Formal%20verification%20of%20software,Our"&gt;eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; [and] mitigate critical system failures.” Lean4 enables writing programs with proofs of properties like “this code never crashes or exposes data.” However, historically, writing such verified code has been labor-intensive and required specialized expertise. Now, with LLMs, there’s an opportunity to automate and scale this process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have begun creating benchmarks like VeriBench to push LLMs to generate Lean4-verified programs from ordinary code. Early results show today’s models are not yet up to the task for arbitrary software – in one evaluation, a state-of-the-art model could fully verify only ~12% of given programming challenges in Lean4. Yet, an experimental AI “agent” approach (iteratively self-correcting with Lean feedback) raised that success rate to nearly 60%. This is a promising leap, hinting that future AI coding assistants might routinely produce machine-checkable, bug-free code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic significance for enterprises is huge. Imagine being able to ask an AI to write a piece of software and receiving not just the code, but a proof that it is secure and correct by design. Such proofs could guarantee no buffer overflows, no race conditions and compliance with security policies. In sectors like banking, healthcare or critical infrastructure, this could drastically reduce risks. It’s telling that formal verification is already standard in high-stakes fields (that is, verifying the firmware of medical devices or avionics systems). Harmonic’s CEO explicitly notes that similar verification technology is used in “medical devices and aviation” for safety – Lean4 is bringing that level of rigor into the AI toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond software bugs, Lean4 can encode and verify domain-specific safety rules. For instance, consider AI systems that design engineering projects. A LessWrong forum discussion on AI safety gives the example of bridge design: An AI could propose a bridge structure, and formal systems like Lean can certify that the design obeys all the mechanical engineering safety criteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bridge’s compliance with load tolerances, material strength and design codes becomes a &lt;a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rWkGFmnSNl#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20Formal%20verification%20of%20software,Our"&gt;theorem in Lean&lt;/a&gt;, which, once proved, serves as an unimpeachable safety certificate. The broader vision is that any AI decision impacting the physical world – from circuit layouts to aerospace trajectories – could be accompanied by a Lean4 proof that it meets specified safety constraints. In effect, Lean4 adds a layer of trust on top of AI outputs: If the AI can’t prove it’s safe or correct, it doesn’t get deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;From big tech to startups: A growing movement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What started in academia as a niche tool for mathematicians is rapidly becoming a mainstream pursuit in AI. Over the last few years, major AI labs and startups alike have embraced Lean4 to push the frontier of reliable AI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OpenAI and Meta (2022):&lt;/b&gt; Both organizations &lt;a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-math-theorem-proving/"&gt;independently trained AI models&lt;/a&gt; to solve high-school olympiad math problems by generating formal proofs in Lean. This was a landmark moment, demonstrating that large models can interface with formal theorem provers and achieve non-trivial results. Meta even made their Lean-enabled model publicly available for researchers. These projects showed that Lean4 can work hand-in-hand with LLMs to tackle problems that demand step-by-step logical rigor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Google DeepMind (2024):&lt;/b&gt; DeepMind’s AlphaProof system &lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/"&gt;proved mathematical statements&lt;/a&gt; in Lean4 at roughly the level of an International Math Olympiad silver medalist. It was the first AI to reach “medal-worthy” performance on formal math competition problems – essentially confirming that AI can achieve top-tier reasoning skills when aligned with a proof assistant. AlphaProof’s success underscored that Lean4 isn’t just a debugging tool; it’s enabling new heights of automated reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Startup ecosystem:&lt;/b&gt; The aforementioned Harmonic AI is a leading example, raising significant funding ($100M in 2025) to build “hallucination-free” AI by using Lean4 as its backbone. Another effort, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21801"&gt;DeepSeek&lt;/a&gt;, has been releasing open-source Lean4 prover models aimed at democratizing this technology. We’re also seeing academic startups and tools – for example, Lean-based verifiers being integrated into coding assistants, and new benchmarks like FormalStep and VeriBench guiding the research community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Community and education:&lt;/b&gt; A vibrant community has grown around Lean (the Lean Prover forum, mathlib library), and even &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-team-of-math-proves-a-critical-link-between-addition-and-sets-20231206/"&gt;famous mathematicians&lt;/a&gt; like Terence Tao have started using Lean4 with AI assistance to formalize cutting-edge math results. This melding of human expertise, community knowledge and AI hints at the collaborative future of formal methods in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these developments point to a convergence: AI and formal verification are no longer separate worlds. The techniques and learnings are cross-pollinating. Each success – whether it’s solving a math theorem or catching a software bug – builds confidence that Lean4 can handle more complex, real-world problems in AI safety and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenges and the road ahead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to temper excitement with a dose of reality. Lean4’s integration into AI workflows is still in its early days, and there are hurdles to overcome:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scalability:&lt;/b&gt; Formalizing real-world knowledge or large codebases in Lean4 can be labor-intensive. Lean requires precise specification of problems, which isn’t always straightforward for messy, real-world scenarios. Efforts like auto-formalization (where AI converts informal specs into Lean code) are underway, but more progress is needed to make this seamless for everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Model limitations:&lt;/b&gt; Current LLMs, even cutting-edge ones, struggle to produce correct Lean4 proofs or programs without guidance. The failure rate on benchmarks like VeriBench shows that generating fully verified solutions is a difficult challenge. Advancing AI’s capabilities to understand and generate formal logic is an active area of research – and success isn’t guaranteed to be quick. However, every improvement in AI reasoning (like better chain-of-thought or specialized training on formal tasks) is likely to boost performance here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;User expertise:&lt;/b&gt; Utilizing Lean4 verification requires a new mindset for developers and decision-makers. Organizations may need to invest in training or new hires who understand formal methods. The cultural shift to insist on proofs might take time, much like the adoption of automated testing or static analysis did in the past. Early adopters will need to showcase wins to convince the broader industry of the ROI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the trajectory is set. As one commentator observed, we are in a race between AI’s expanding capabilities and our ability to harness those capabilities safely. Formal verification tools like Lean4 are among the most promising means to tilt the balance toward safety. They provide a principled way to ensure AI systems do exactly what we intend, no more and no less, with proofs to show it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Toward provably safe AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an era when AI systems are increasingly making decisions that affect lives and critical infrastructure, trust is the scarcest resource. Lean4 offers a path to earn that trust not through promises, but through proof. By bringing formal mathematical certainty into AI development, we can build systems that are verifiably correct, secure, and aligned with our objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From enabling LLMs to solve problems with guaranteed accuracy, to generating software free of exploitable bugs, Lean4’s role in AI is expanding from a research curiosity to a strategic necessity. Tech giants and startups alike are investing in this approach, pointing to a future where saying “the AI seems to be correct” is not enough – we will demand “the AI can show it’s correct.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise decision-makers, the message is clear: It’s time to watch this space closely. Incorporating formal verification via Lean4 could become a competitive advantage in delivering AI products that customers and regulators trust. We are witnessing the early steps of AI’s evolution from an intuitive apprentice to a formally validated expert. Lean4 is not a magic bullet for all AI safety concerns, but it is a powerful ingredient in the recipe for safe, deterministic AI that actually does what it’s supposed to do – nothing more, nothing less, nothing incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI continues to advance, those who combine its power with the rigor of formal proof will lead the way in deploying systems that are not only intelligent, but provably reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dhyey Mavani is accelerating generative AI at LinkedIn. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Read more from our &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/datadecisionmakers"&gt;&lt;i&gt;guest writers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.

See our &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/guest-posts"&gt;&lt;i&gt;guidelines here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) have astounded the world with their capabilities, yet they remain plagued by unpredictability and hallucinations – confidently outputting incorrect information. In high-stakes domains like finance, medicine or autonomous systems, such unreliability is unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;b&gt;Lean4&lt;/b&gt;, an open-source programming language and interactive theorem prover becoming a key tool to inject rigor and certainty into AI systems. By leveraging formal verification, Lean4 promises to make AI safer, more secure and deterministic in its functionality. Let&amp;#x27;s explore how Lean4 is being adopted by AI leaders and why it could become foundational for building trustworthy AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is Lean4 and why it matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lean4 is both a programming language and a proof assistant designed for formal verification. Every theorem or program written in Lean4 must pass a strict type-checking by Lean’s trusted kernel, yielding a binary verdict: A statement either checks out as correct or it doesn’t. This all-or-nothing verification means there’s no room for ambiguity – a property or result is proven true or it fails. Such rigorous checking “&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2505.05758v3#:~:text=and%20an%20ITP,to%20natural%20language%20logical%20reasoning"&gt;dramatically increases the reliability&lt;/a&gt;” of anything formalized in Lean4. In other words, Lean4 &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/from-shiny-object-to-sober-reality-the-vector-database-story-two-years-later"&gt;provides a framework&lt;/a&gt; where correctness is mathematically guaranteed, not just hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This level of certainty is precisely what today’s AI systems lack. Modern AI outputs are generated by complex neural networks with probabilistic behavior. Ask the same question twice and you might get different answers. By contrast, a Lean4 proof or program will behave deterministically – given the same input, it produces the same verified result every time. This determinism and transparency (every inference step can be audited) make Lean4 an appealing antidote to AI’s unpredictability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key advantages of Lean4’s formal verification&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Precision and reliability:&lt;/b&gt; Formal proofs avoid ambiguity through strict logic, ensuring each reasoning step is valid and results are correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Systematic verification:&lt;/b&gt; Lean4 can formally verify that a solution meets all specified conditions or axioms, acting as an objective referee for correctness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency and reproducibility:&lt;/b&gt; Anyone can independently check a Lean4 proof, and the outcome will be the same – a stark contrast to the opaque reasoning of neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, Lean4 brings the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2505.05758v3#:~:text=and%20an%20ITP,to%20natural%20language%20logical%20reasoning"&gt;gold standard of mathematical rigor&lt;/a&gt; to computing and AI. It enables us to turn an AI’s claim (“I found a solution”) into a formally checkable proof that is indeed correct. This capability is proving to be a game-changer in several aspects of AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lean4 as a safety net for LLMs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting intersections of Lean4 and AI is in improving LLM accuracy and safety. &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/6-proven-lessons-from-the-ai-projects-that-broke-before-they-scaled"&gt;Research groups&lt;/a&gt; and startups are now combining LLMs’ natural language prowess with Lean4’s formal checks to create AI systems that reason correctly by construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the problem of AI hallucinations, when an AI confidently asserts false information. Instead of adding more opaque patches (like heuristic penalties or reinforcement tweaks), why not prevent hallucinations by having the AI prove its statements? That’s exactly what some recent efforts do. For example, a 2025 research framework called &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04592#:~:text=limiting%20their%20effectiveness,proving%20with%20%2430%2C809%24%20formal%20statements"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Safe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; uses Lean4 to verify each step of an LLM’s reasoning. The idea is simple but powerful: Each step in the AI’s chain-of-thought (CoT) translates the claim into Lean4’s formal language and the AI (or a proof assistant) provides a proof. If the proof fails, the system knows the reasoning was flawed – a clear indicator of a hallucination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step-by-step formal audit trail dramatically improves reliability, catching mistakes as they happen and providing &lt;a href="https://quantumzeitgeist.com/large-language-models-verified-with-formal-mathematics-reduce-hallucinations/#:~:text=from%20Huawei%20Noah%E2%80%99s%20Ark%20Lab,step%20correctness"&gt;checkable evidence&lt;/a&gt; for every conclusion. The approach that has shown “significant performance improvement while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence” of correctness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another prominent example is Harmonic AI, a startup co-founded by Vlad Tenev (of Robinhood fame) that tackles hallucinations in AI. Harmonic’s system, Aristotle, solves math problems by generating Lean4 proofs for its answers and formally verifying them before responding to the user. “[Aristotle] formally verifies the output… we actually do guarantee that there’s no hallucinations,” &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/harmonic-the-robinhood-ceos-ai-math-startup-launches-an-ai-chatbot-app/#:~:text=formally%20verifies%20the%20output%2C%E2%80%9D%20said,%E2%80%9D"&gt;Harmonic’s CEO explains&lt;/a&gt;. In practical terms, Aristotle writes a solution in Lean4’s language and runs the Lean4 checker. Only if the proof checks out as correct does it present the answer. This yields a “hallucination-free” math chatbot – a bold claim, but one backed by Lean4’s deterministic proof checking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, this method isn’t limited to toy problems. Harmonic reports that Aristotle achieved a gold-medal level performance on the 2025 International Math Olympiad problems, the key difference that its solutions were formally verified, unlike other AI models that merely gave answers in English. In other words, where tech giants Google and OpenAI also reached human-champion level on math questions, Aristotle did so with a proof in hand. The takeaway for AI safety is compelling: When an answer comes with a Lean4 proof, you don’t have to trust the AI – you can check it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could be extended to many domains. We could imagine an &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/large-reasoning-models-almost-certainly-can-think"&gt;LLM assistant&lt;/a&gt; for finance that provides an answer only if it can generate a formal proof that it adheres to accounting rules or legal constraints. Or, an AI scientific adviser that outputs a hypothesis alongside a Lean4 proof of consistency with known physics laws. The pattern is the same – Lean4 acts as a rigorous safety net, filtering out incorrect or unverified results. As one AI researcher from &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04592#:~:text=limiting%20their%20effectiveness,also%20propose%20%24FormalStep%24%20as%20a"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Safe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; put it, “the gold standard for supporting a claim is to provide a proof,” and now AI can attempt exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building secure and reliable systems with Lean4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lean4’s value isn’t confined to pure reasoning tasks; it’s also poised to revolutionize software security and reliability in the age of AI. Bugs and vulnerabilities in software are essentially small logic errors that slip through human testing. What if AI-assisted programming could eliminate those by using Lean4 to verify code correctness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In formal methods circles, it’s well known that provably correct code can “&lt;a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rWkGFmnSNl#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20Formal%20verification%20of%20software,Our"&gt;eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; [and] mitigate critical system failures.” Lean4 enables writing programs with proofs of properties like “this code never crashes or exposes data.” However, historically, writing such verified code has been labor-intensive and required specialized expertise. Now, with LLMs, there’s an opportunity to automate and scale this process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have begun creating benchmarks like VeriBench to push LLMs to generate Lean4-verified programs from ordinary code. Early results show today’s models are not yet up to the task for arbitrary software – in one evaluation, a state-of-the-art model could fully verify only ~12% of given programming challenges in Lean4. Yet, an experimental AI “agent” approach (iteratively self-correcting with Lean feedback) raised that success rate to nearly 60%. This is a promising leap, hinting that future AI coding assistants might routinely produce machine-checkable, bug-free code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic significance for enterprises is huge. Imagine being able to ask an AI to write a piece of software and receiving not just the code, but a proof that it is secure and correct by design. Such proofs could guarantee no buffer overflows, no race conditions and compliance with security policies. In sectors like banking, healthcare or critical infrastructure, this could drastically reduce risks. It’s telling that formal verification is already standard in high-stakes fields (that is, verifying the firmware of medical devices or avionics systems). Harmonic’s CEO explicitly notes that similar verification technology is used in “medical devices and aviation” for safety – Lean4 is bringing that level of rigor into the AI toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond software bugs, Lean4 can encode and verify domain-specific safety rules. For instance, consider AI systems that design engineering projects. A LessWrong forum discussion on AI safety gives the example of bridge design: An AI could propose a bridge structure, and formal systems like Lean can certify that the design obeys all the mechanical engineering safety criteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bridge’s compliance with load tolerances, material strength and design codes becomes a &lt;a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rWkGFmnSNl#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20Formal%20verification%20of%20software,Our"&gt;theorem in Lean&lt;/a&gt;, which, once proved, serves as an unimpeachable safety certificate. The broader vision is that any AI decision impacting the physical world – from circuit layouts to aerospace trajectories – could be accompanied by a Lean4 proof that it meets specified safety constraints. In effect, Lean4 adds a layer of trust on top of AI outputs: If the AI can’t prove it’s safe or correct, it doesn’t get deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;From big tech to startups: A growing movement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What started in academia as a niche tool for mathematicians is rapidly becoming a mainstream pursuit in AI. Over the last few years, major AI labs and startups alike have embraced Lean4 to push the frontier of reliable AI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OpenAI and Meta (2022):&lt;/b&gt; Both organizations &lt;a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-math-theorem-proving/"&gt;independently trained AI models&lt;/a&gt; to solve high-school olympiad math problems by generating formal proofs in Lean. This was a landmark moment, demonstrating that large models can interface with formal theorem provers and achieve non-trivial results. Meta even made their Lean-enabled model publicly available for researchers. These projects showed that Lean4 can work hand-in-hand with LLMs to tackle problems that demand step-by-step logical rigor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Google DeepMind (2024):&lt;/b&gt; DeepMind’s AlphaProof system &lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/"&gt;proved mathematical statements&lt;/a&gt; in Lean4 at roughly the level of an International Math Olympiad silver medalist.
