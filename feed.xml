          &lt;p&gt;Alphabet has lined up banks to sell a rare 100-year bond, stepping up a borrowing spree by Big Tech companies racing to fund their vast investments in AI this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called century bond will form part of a debut sterling issuance this week by Google’s parent company, said people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphabet was also selling $20 billion of dollar bonds on Monday and lining up a Swiss franc bond sale, the people said. The dollar portion of the deal was upsized from $15 billion because of strong demand, they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Century bonds—long-term borrowing at its most extreme—are highly unusual, although a flurry was sold during the period of very low interest rates that followed the financial crisis, including by governments such as Austria and Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Oxford, EDF, and the Wellcome Trust—the most recent in 2018—are the only issuers to have tapped the sterling century market. Such sales are even rarer in the tech sector, with most of the industry’s biggest groups issuing up to 40 years, although IBM sold a 100-year bond in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A banker familiar with Alphabet’s transaction said the company’s multi-currency bond offering is an effort to expand the investor pool given the massive amount of capital needed by Big Tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There might be a supply-demand imbalance if you were to try to come back to the US dollar market over and over again,” the banker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuing a century bond in the sterling market is more cost-effective than in the dollar market, where the interest rate is higher, the banker added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a century bond is “highly unusual” for tech companies, it could appeal to buyers such as life insurance companies and pension funds, which have a mandate to buy long-term assets, said Nicholas Elfner, co-head of research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony Trzcinka, a US-based senior portfolio manager at Impax Asset Management, which purchased Alphabet’s bonds last year, said he skipped Monday’s offering because of insufficient yields and concerns about overexposure to companies with complex financial obligations tied to AI investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t worth it to swap into new ones,” Trzcinka said. “We’ve been very conscious of our exposure to these hyperscalers and their capex budgets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Tech companies and their suppliers are expected to invest almost $700 billion in AI infrastructure this year and are increasingly turning to the debt markets to finance the giant data center build-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphabet in November sold $17.5 billion of bonds in the US including a 50-year bond—the longest-dated dollar bond sold by a tech group last year—and raised €6.5 billion on European markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle last week raised $25 billion from a bond sale that attracted more than $125 billion of orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta all increased their capital expenditure plans during their most recent earnings reports, prompting questions about whether they will be able to fund the unprecedented spending spree from their cash flows alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Google’s parent company reported annual sales that topped $400 billion for the first time, beating investors’ expectations for revenues and profits in the most recent quarter. It said it planned to spend as much as $185 billion on capex this year, roughly double last year’s total, to capitalize on booming demand for its Gemini AI assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphabet’s long-term debt jumped to $46.5 billion in 2025, up more than four times the previous year, though it held cash and equivalents of $126.8 billion at the year-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor demand was the strongest on the shortest portion of Monday’s deal, with a three-year offering pricing at only 0.27 percentage points above US Treasuries, versus 0.6 percentage points during initial price discussions, said people familiar with the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longest portion of the offering, a 40-year bond, is expected to yield 0.95 percentage points over US Treasuries, down from 1.2 percentage points during initial talks, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan are the bookrunners on the bond sales across three currencies. All three declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a move that could reshape how global tech firms moderate content in one of the world’s largest and fastest growing markets for internet services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The changes, published (PDF) on Tuesday as amendments to India’s 2021 IT Rules, bring deepfakes under a formal regulatory framework, mandating the labeling and traceability of synthetic audio and visual content, while also slashing compliance timelines for platforms, including a three-hour deadline for official takedown orders and a two-hour window for certain urgent user complaints.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India’s importance as a digital market amplifies the impact of the new rules. With over a billion internet users and a predominantly young population, the South Asian nation is a critical market for platforms like Meta and YouTube, making it likely that compliance measures adopted in India will influence global product and moderation practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under the amended rules, social media platforms that allow users to upload or share audio-visual content must require disclosures on whether material is synthetically generated, deploy tools to verify those claims, and ensure that deepfakes are clearly labeled and embedded with traceable provenance data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Certain categories of synthetic content — including deceptive impersonations, non-consensual intimate imagery, and material linked to serious crimes — are barred outright in the rules. Non-compliance, particularly in cases flagged by authorities or users, can expose companies to greater legal liability by jeopardizing their safe-harbor protections under Indian law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The rules lean heavily on automated systems to meet those obligations. Platforms are expected to deploy technical tools to verify user disclosures, identify, and label deepfakes, and prevent the creation or sharing of prohibited synthetic content in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The amended IT Rules mark a more calibrated approach to regulating AI-generated deepfakes,” said Rohit Kumar, founding partner at New Delhi-based policy consulting firm The Quantum Hub. “The significantly compressed grievance timelines — such as the two- to three-hour takedown windows — will materially raise compliance burdens and merit close scrutiny, particularly given that non-compliance is linked to the loss of safe harbor protections.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aprajita Rana, a partner at AZB &amp;amp; Partners, a leading Indian corporate law firm, said the rules now focus on AI-generated audio-visual content rather than all online information, while carving out exceptions for routine, cosmetic, or efficiency-related uses of AI. However, she cautioned that the requirement for intermediaries to remove content within three hours once they become aware of it departs from established free-speech principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The law, however, continues to require intermediaries to remove content upon being aware or receiving actual knowledge, that too within three hours,” Rana said, adding that the labeling requirements would apply across formats to curb the spread of child sexual abuse material and deceptive content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;New Delhi-based digital advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation said the rules risk accelerating censorship by drastically compressing takedown timelines, leaving little scope for human review and pushing platforms toward automated over-removal. In a statement posted on X, the group also raised concerns about the expansion of prohibited content categories and provisions that allow platforms to disclose the identities of users to private complainants without judicial oversight.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“These impossibly short timelines eliminate any meaningful human review,” the group said, warning that the changes could undermine free-speech protections and due process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Two industry sources told TechCrunch that the amendments followed a limited consultation process, with only a narrow set of suggestions reflected in the final rules. While the Indian government appears to have taken on board proposals to narrow the scope of information covered — focusing on AI-generated audio-visual content rather than all online material — other recommendations were not adopted. The scale of changes between the draft and final rules warranted another round of consultation to give companies clearer guidance on compliance expectations, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Government takedown powers have already been a point of contention in India. Social media platforms and civil-society groups have long criticized the breadth and opacity of content removal orders, and even Elon Musk’s X challenged New Delhi in court over directives to block or remove posts, arguing that they amounted to overreach and lacked adequate safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta, Google, Snap, X, and the Indian IT ministry did not respond to requests for comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest changes come just months after the Indian government, in October 2025, reduced the number of officials authorized to order content removals from the internet in response to a legal challenge by X over the scope and transparency of takedown powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The amended rules will come into effect on February 20, giving platforms little time to adjust compliance systems. The rollout coincides with India’s hosting of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi from February 16 to 20, which is expected to draw senior global technology executives and policymakers to the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/india-parliament-getty.jpg?w=1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;India has ordered social media platforms to step up policing of deepfakes and other AI-generated impersonations, while sharply shortening the time they have to comply with takedown orders. It’s a move that could reshape how global tech firms moderate content in one of the world’s largest and fastest growing markets for internet services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The changes, published (PDF) on Tuesday as amendments to India’s 2021 IT Rules, bring deepfakes under a formal regulatory framework, mandating the labeling and traceability of synthetic audio and visual content, while also slashing compliance timelines for platforms, including a three-hour deadline for official takedown orders and a two-hour window for certain urgent user complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The New York-based startup raised $16 million in a Series A round led by Frontier Growth with participation from K5 Global and Somersault Ventures, among others, TechCrunch has learned. Hauler Hero has raised more than $27 million in venture capital, to date.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hauler Hero has developed an all-in-one software platform for waste management companies that covers a variety of functions, including customer relationship management, billing, and routing. And now, like so many other software companies, Hauler Hero plans to offer AI agents to its customers as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hauler Hero was co-founded in 2020 by CEO Mark Hoadley and brother-in-law Ben Sikma, who encountered outdated software while working on mergers and acquisitions in the sector. Their aim was to bring waste management into the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“All of the existing software in the space, they were clunky, old,” Hoadley told TechCrunch in 2024. “Sometimes we’d talk about how this one reminds us of the Oregon Trail, this reminds us of the cell phone Michael Douglas used in ‘Wall Street.’ They’re very clunky and antiquated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The numbers suggest the company has had some success; Hauler Hero said it has helped facilitate 35 million trash pickups since inception in 2020. And it continues to grow, according to Hoadley, who told TechCrunch the company has doubled its head count, revenue, and customer base since announcing its seed round in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hauler Hero has added new features to its platform since its seed round, Hoadley said. The most notable is a product that captures images from third-party cameras on garbage trucks and sends them directly to a software command center. This information helps waste management companies confirm pickups, verify billing, and keep a better eye on their distributed fleet, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hoadley said some sanitation workers, and their respective unions, don’t love this tech upgrade. But he added that most unions prevent the footage from being used against the drivers for disciplinary measures, for example, and that the images can actually help reduce liability for drivers in accidents or if they are accused of missing a pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Think of it as like running a factory with no roof and no visibility into what’s happening in that factory,” Hoadley said. “If you don’t have visibility into what’s happening out there, it’s very hard to have quality control. And the quality control in this case is what was out there, was it picked up?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-trio-of-ai-agents"&gt;A trio of AI agents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hauler Hero is now working to develop and deploy a set of three AI agents. One, Hero Vision, is focused on automatically identifying service issues and revenue opportunities. Hero Chat is a chatbot for customer inquiries. Hero Route will use route data to automatically adjust routes to make them more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There’s an enormous amount of data in our system about pickups, work orders, billing information, and if you give these agents an understanding of your data model, you can just go tell them, hey, go build me a chart,” Hoadley said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hauler Hero plans to use some of its recent funding to commercialize these agents in addition to bulking up its offerings for municipal entities, a growing group of the company’s customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It wasn’t something that I necessarily thought was going to be part of this journey,” Hoadley said about working with these public entities. “It kind of came organically as many things do. We just had inbound from some municipalities and eventually we sold one of them and then we sold another.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hoadley said that he thinks some of that demand is driven by the fact that its two main competitors, Routeware and Wastech, merged in 2024, leaving government entities with little choice of providers to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hoadley said the company is now focused on fine-tuning and scaling its product — and maybe some new additions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re going to continue to chart the course for the next decade of being at the cutting edge of delivering value for customers, leveraging all the latest tools,” Hoadley said. “There’s a lot more fun things and valuable things that we can do for our customers, and we’re really excited about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI cybersecurity startup Vega Security wants to flip that approach by running security where the data already lives, implementing in cloud services, data lakes, and existing storage systems. And the two-year-old firm just raised a $120 million Series B round to scale that vision, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Led by Accel with participation from Cyberstarts, Redpoint, and CRV, the new round nearly doubles Vega’s valuation to $700 million, and brings its total funding to $185 million, money the startup will use to further develop its AI-native security operations suite, beef up its go-to-market team, and expand globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega, told TechCrunch that the current operating model of the SIEM (security information and event management) — the dominant technology in this domain for the last two decades — is not only “crazy expensive,” but is also increasingly causing AI-native security operations to fail. In complex cloud environments, he says, the current model often increases exposure to threat actors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Vega has defined a new operating model that enables organizations to leverage the full potential of their enterprise data to achieve incident response readiness, without all the complexity, the cost, the drama,” Sandler told TechCrunch. “We want to simply enable them to reach AI-native detection response capability anywhere the data is, at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like so many cybersecurity founders, Sandler did his time in the Israeli military’s cybersecurity unit before being one of the founding employees behind Granulate, which Intel acquired for $650 million in 2022. After a year at Intel, Sandler decided to “do it big time in the cybersecurity world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That pedigree is partly what attracted the attention of Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel. But it was also Vega’s ambitious approach to security management in a market that is already dominated by one player: Splunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brasoveanu told TechCrunch that legacy SIEM companies like Splunk, which Cisco acquired in 2024 for $28 billion, have been criticized in recent years because their solutions are difficult to scale. They fail at processing the insane rise of data volumes driven by AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Splunk and every contender since has always centralized the data, but by doing that you essentially hold the customer hostage,” Brasoveanu said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, sometimes it’s easier to hate the status quo than do the work of making a switch to a better alternative, a quandary any startup attempting to breach enterprise budgets understands. That’s why Sandler says Vega’s “North Star” was to not only build a solution that is more cost effective and better at threat detection, but “to make it no drama, as simple as possible for the biggest, most complex enterprises in the world to adopt it within minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vega’s approach seems to be working. The 100-person startup has already signed multimillion-dollar contracts with banks, healthcare companies, and Fortune 500 firms, including cloud-heavy companies like Instacart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The only reason they would do that with a two-year-old startup is because the problem is so painful and other solutions on the market require an unrealistic expectation that the enterprise change the way they operate or do two years of data migrations,” Sandler said. “Vega enables them to just plug and play and achieve immediate detection response value.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Shay-Sandler-Eli-Rosen.-Credit-Ohad-Kab.jpeg?resize=1200,802" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Modern enterprises generate enormous amounts of security data, but legacy tools like Splunk still require companies to store all of it in one place before they can detect threats — a slow and costly process that’s increasingly breaking down in cloud environments where volumes are exploding and data lives everywhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI cybersecurity startup Vega Security wants to flip that approach by running security where the data already lives, implementing in cloud services, data lakes, and existing storage systems. And the two-year-old firm just raised a $120 million Series B round to scale that vision, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Led by Accel with participation from Cyberstarts, Redpoint, and CRV, the new round nearly doubles Vega’s valuation to $700 million, and brings its total funding to $185 million, money the startup will use to further develop its AI-native security operations suite, beef up its go-to-market team, and expand globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega, told TechCrunch that the current operating model of the SIEM (security information and event management) — the dominant technology in this domain for the last two decades — is not only “crazy expensive,” but is also increasingly causing AI-native security operations to fail. In complex cloud environments, he says, the current model often increases exposure to threat actors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Vega has defined a new operating model that enables organizations to leverage the full potential of their enterprise data to achieve incident response readiness, without all the complexity, the cost, the drama,” Sandler told TechCrunch. “We want to simply enable them to reach AI-native detection response capability anywhere the data is, at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like so many cybersecurity founders, Sandler did his time in the Israeli military’s cybersecurity unit before being one of the founding employees behind Granulate, which Intel acquired for $650 million in 2022. After a year at Intel, Sandler decided to “do it big time in the cybersecurity world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That pedigree is partly what attracted the attention of Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel. But it was also Vega’s ambitious approach to security management in a market that is already dominated by one player: Splunk.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brasoveanu told TechCrunch that legacy SIEM companies like Splunk, which Cisco acquired in 2024 for $28 billion, have been criticized in recent years because their solutions are difficult to scale. They fail at processing the insane rise of data volumes driven by AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Splunk and every contender since has always centralized the data, but by doing that you essentially hold the customer hostage,” Brasoveanu said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, sometimes it’s easier to hate the status quo than do the work of making a switch to a better alternative, a quandary any startup attempting to breach enterprise budgets understands. That’s why Sandler says Vega’s “North Star” was to not only build a solution that is more cost effective and better at threat detection, but “to make it no drama, as simple as possible for the biggest, most complex enterprises in the world to adopt it within minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;

But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. Many lamented the performance of GPT-5.2, the latest model. Others shared memes parodying the chatbot’s sycophancy. Some planned a “Mass Cancellation Party” in San Francisco, a sardonic nod to the GPT-4o funeral that an OpenAI employee had floated, poking fun at users who are mourning the model’s impending retirement. Still, others are protesting against what they see as a deepening entanglement between OpenAI and the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As of December 2025,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;ChatGPT had nearly 900 million weekly active users, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. While it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, QuitGPT is getting attention. A recent Instagram post from the campaign has more than 36 million views and 1.3 million likes. And the organizers say that more than 17,000 people have signed up on the campaign’s website, which asks people whether they canceled their subscriptions, will commit to stop using ChatGPT, or will share the campaign on social media.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“There are lots of examples of failed campaigns like this, but we have seen a lot of effectiveness,” says Dana Fisher, a sociologist at American University. A wave of canceled subscriptions rarely sways a company’s behavior, unless it reaches a critical mass, she says. “The place where there’s a pressure point that might work is where the consumer behavior is if enough people actually use their … money to express their political opinions.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;reached out to three&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;employees at OpenAI, none of whom said they were familiar with the campaign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dozens of left-leaning teens and twentysomethings scattered across the US came together to organize QuitGPT in late January. They range from pro-democracy activists and climate organizers to techies and self-proclaimed cyber libertarians, many of them seasoned grassroots campaigners. They were inspired by a viral video posted by Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University and host of &lt;em&gt;The Prof G Pod&lt;/em&gt;. He argued that the best way to stop ICE was to persuade people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions. Denting OpenAI’s subscriber base could ripple through the stock market and threaten an economic downturn that would nudge Trump, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We make a big enough stink for OpenAI that all of the companies in the whole AI industry have to think about whether they’re going to get away enabling Trump and ICE and authoritarianism,” says an organizer of QuitGPT who requested anonymity because he feared retaliation by OpenAI, citing the company’s recent subpoenas against advocates at nonprofits. OpenAI made for an obvious first target of the movement, he says, but “this is about so much more than just OpenAI.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simon Rosenblum-Larson, a labor organizer in Madison, Wisconsin, who organizes movements to regulate the development of data centers, joined the campaign after hearing about it through Signal chats among community activists. “The goal here is to pull away the support pillars of the Trump administration. They’re reliant on many of these tech billionaires for support and for resources,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;QuitGPT’s website points to new campaign finance reports showing that Greg Brockman and his wife each donated $12.5 million to MAGA Inc., making up nearly a quarter of the roughly $102 million it raised over the second half of 2025. The information that ICE uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4 came from an AI inventory published by the Department of Homeland Security in January.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;QuitGPT is in the mold of Galloway’s own recently launched campaign, Resist and Unsubscribe. The movement urges consumers to cancel their subscriptions to Big Tech platforms, including ChatGPT, for the month of February, as a protest to companies “driving the markets and enabling our president.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are feeling real anxiety,” Galloway told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. “You take enabling a president, proximity to the president, and an unease around AI,” he says, “and now people are starting to take action with their wallets.” Galloway says his campaign’s website can draw more than 200,000 unique visits in a day and that he receives dozens of DMs every hour showing screenshots of canceled subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The consumer boycotts follow a growing wave of pressure from inside the companies themselves. In recent weeks, tech workers have been urging their employers to use their political clout to demand that ICE leave US cities, cancel company contracts with the agency, and speak out against the agency’s actions. CEOs have started responding. OpenAI’s Sam Altman wrote in an internal Slack message to employees that ICE is “going too far.” Apple CEO Tim Cook called for a “deescalation” in an internal memo posted on the company’s website for employees. It was a departure from how Big Tech CEOs have courted President Trump with dinners and donations since his inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although spurred by a fatal immigration crackdown, these developments signal that a sprawling anti-AI movement is gaining momentum. The campaigns are tapping into simmering anxieties about AI, says Rosenblum-Larson, including the energy costs of data centers, the plague of deepfake porn, the teen mental-health crisis, the job apocalypse, and slop. “It’s a really strange set of coalitions built around the AI movement,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Those are the right conditions for a movement to spring up,” says David Karpf, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. Brockman’s donation to Trump’s super PAC caught many users off guard, he says. “In the longer arc, we are going to see users respond and react to Big Tech, deciding that they’re not okay with this.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260205_chatgpt_boycott_hero.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work.

          &lt;p&gt;xAI co-founder Tony Wu abruptly announced his resignation from the company late Monday night, the latest in a string of senior executives to leave the Grok-maker in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on social media, Wu expressed warm feelings for his time at xAI, but said it was “time for my next chapter.” The current era is one where “a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mention of what “a small team” can do could hint at a potential reason for Wu’s departure. xAI reportedly had 1,200 employees as of March 2025, a number that included AI engineers and those focused more on the X social network. That number also included 900 employees that served solely as “AI tutors,” though roughly 500 of those were reportedly laid off in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu’s departure comes just months after fellow xAI co-founder Igor Babuschkin departed the company in August to start his own AI safety-focused venture capital firm. Co-founders Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy also departed the company since its 2023 founding, and co-founder Greg Yang stepped back from the company last month amid complications from chronic Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other recent high-profile xAI departures include general counsel Robert Keele, communications executives Dave Heinzinger and John Stoll, head of product engineering Haofei Wang, and CFO Mike Liberatore, who left for a role at OpenAI after just 102 days of what he called “120+ hour weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A different company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu leaves a company that is in a very different place than it was when he helped create it in 2023. His departure comes just days after CEO Elon Musk merged xAI with SpaceX, a move Musk says will allow for orbiting data centers and, eventually, “scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!” But some see the move as more of a financial engineering play, combining xAI’s nearly $1 billion a year in losses and SpaceX’s roughly $8 billion in annual profits into a single, more IPO-ready entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk previously rolled social media network X (formerly Twitter) into a unified entity with xAI back in March. At the time of the deal, X was valued at $33 billion, 25 percent less than Musk paid for the social network in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI has faced a fresh wave of criticism in recent months over Grok’s willingness to generate sexualized images of minors. That has led to an investigation by California’s attorney general and a police raid of the company’s Paris offices.&lt;/p&gt;

The updates include animated profile pictures, photo-restyling tools for Stories and Memories, and the ability to add animated backgrounds to text posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​As Meta works to maintain Facebook’s relevance among younger users on its flagship app, it’s likely betting that these new features will deliver a more personalized experience that appeals to Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​The new animated profile picture feature applies motion effects to static photos, making the subject appear to be waving, making a heart shape, or wearing a virtual party hat. To achieve the best results, Facebook recommends using a clear photo of a single person facing the camera. Photos can be pulled directly from a user’s camera roll or from images already on the platform. The company also plans to add more animation options throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3091610" height="591" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/FB-animatedProfile-Picture.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​Facebook is also enhancing its Stories — short photo and video posts that disappear after 24 hours — and Memories — a feature that resurfaces posts from the same date in previous years — with “Restyle,” a tool that uses Meta AI to reimagine the look of user-uploaded images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After uploading a photo to Stories or selecting a Memory to share, users can tap Restyle and either enter a text-based prompt or select from preset themes, including anime, illustrated, glowy, ethereal, and more. There are also options to adjust moods, lighting, and colors, and to swap in new backdrops such as a beach or a cityscape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​To spice up text posts, Facebook is also gradually rolling out animated backgrounds. By clicking on the new rainbow “A” icon, users can choose from a variety of still and animated scenes, such as falling leaves or rolling ocean waves, to make their posts stand out in the feed. The company says that seasonal backgrounds are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3091611" height="592" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/FB-AI-Text-Posts.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​With around 2.1 billion daily active users, Facebook remains a social media giant. However, in recent years, it has struggled to attract and retain a younger demographic.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To address this, the platform has embraced new technology, including AI, and introduced a more youthful redesign. Other recent updates include a friends-only feed and the ability to use unique display names within Groups, similar to how Reddit handles usernames in its communities.&amp;nbsp;The platform is also attempting to make its poke feature — a way to tap another user on the shoulder, so to speak — relevant again by launching a new dedicated button on users’ profiles that alerts the recipient to a poke via notifications.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Facebook announced new AI-powered features on Tuesday designed to let users express themselves in more playful ways across the platform.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​Facebook is also enhancing its Stories — short photo and video posts that disappear after 24 hours — and Memories — a feature that resurfaces posts from the same date in previous years — with “Restyle,” a tool that uses Meta AI to reimagine the look of user-uploaded images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After uploading a photo to Stories or selecting a Memory to share, users can tap Restyle and either enter a text-based prompt or select from preset themes, including anime, illustrated, glowy, ethereal, and more. There are also options to adjust moods, lighting, and colors, and to swap in new backdrops such as a beach or a cityscape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​To spice up text posts, Facebook is also gradually rolling out animated backgrounds. By clicking on the new rainbow “A” icon, users can choose from a variety of still and animated scenes, such as falling leaves or rolling ocean waves, to make their posts stand out in the feed. The company says that seasonal backgrounds are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​With around 2.1 billion daily active users, Facebook remains a social media giant. However, in recent years, it has struggled to attract and retain a younger demographic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To address this, the platform has embraced new technology, including AI, and introduced a more youthful redesign. Other recent updates include a friends-only feed and the ability to use unique display names within Groups, similar to how Reddit handles usernames in its communities.&amp;nbsp;The platform is also attempting to make its poke feature — a way to tap another user on the shoulder, so to speak — relevant again by launching a new dedicated button on users’ profiles that alerts the recipient to a poke via notifications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/facebook-adds-new-ai-features-animated-profile-photos-and-backgrounds-for-text-posts/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 19:34:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter steps down after 30 years at the company (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/boston-dynamics-ceo-robert-playter-steps-down-after-30-years-at-the-company/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/boston-dynamics-spot-equipped-with-velodyne-lidar.jpeg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Boston Dynamics, the Massachusetts-based robotics company&amp;nbsp;known for its four-legged robots and&amp;nbsp;humanoids,&amp;nbsp;is going through a leadership change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Robert Playter announced in an internal memo on Tuesday that he would be stepping down as the company’s chief executive, as first reported by A3. Amanda McMaster, the company’s&amp;nbsp;chief financial officer,&amp;nbsp;will stand in for the top job while the company&amp;nbsp;looks&amp;nbsp;for a replacement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch reached out to Boston Dynamics for more information.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Playter took the helm at Boston Dynamics in 2020, taking over from founder Marc Raibert. Playter worked at Boston Dynamics for 30 years, where he held other roles, including vice president of engineering and chief operating officer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Boston Dynamics&amp;nbsp;was founded in&amp;nbsp;1992 by Raibert as a spinoff from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a professor. Google’s parent company Alphabet bought Boston Dynamics in 2013,&amp;nbsp;before the company was sold to Japanese investing conglomerate SoftBank in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hyundai, its current owner, acquired the company in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The robotics producer is best known for its quadruped robot, Spot, which the company commercialized in 2020 shortly after Playter took the helm. The company most recently announced Atlas, a humanoid robot.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The signals that drive many of the brain and body’s most essential functions — consciousness, sleep, breathing, heart rate, and motion — course through bundles of “white matter” fibers in the brainstem, but imaging systems so far have been unable to finely resolve these crucial neural cables. That has left researchers and doctors with little capability to assess how they are affected by trauma or neurodegeneration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, a team of MIT, Harvard University, and Massachusetts General Hospital researchers unveil AI-powered software capable of automatically segmenting eight distinct bundles in any diffusion MRI sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the open-access study, published Feb. 6 in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;the research team led by MIT graduate student Mark Olchanyi reports that their BrainStem Bundle Tool (BSBT), which they’ve made publicly available, revealed distinct patterns of structural changes in patients with Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury, and shed light on Alzheimer’s disease as well. Moreover, the study shows, BSBT retrospectively enabled tracking of bundle healing in a coma patient that reflected the patient’s seven-month road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brainstem is a region of the brain that is essentially not explored because it is tough to image,” says Olchanyi, a doctoral candidate in MIT’s Medical Engineering and Medical Physics Program. “People don't really understand its makeup from an imaging perspective. We need to understand what the organization of the white matter is in humans and how this organization breaks down in certain disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adds Professor Emery N. Brown, Olchanyi’s thesis supervisor and co-senior author of the study, “the brainstem is one of the body’s most important control centers. Mark’s algorithms are a significant contribution to imaging research and to our ability to the understand regulation of fundamental physiology. By enhancing our capacity&amp;nbsp;to image the brainstem, he offers us new access to vital physiological functions such as control of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, temperature regulation, how we stay awake during the day and how sleep at night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown is the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Computational Neuroscience and Medical Engineering in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. He is also an anesthesiologist at MGH and a professor at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diffusion MRI helps trace the long branches, or “axons,” that neurons extend to communicate with each other. Axons are typically clad in a sheath of fat called myelin, and water diffuses along the axons within the myelin, which is also called the brain’s “white matter.” Diffusion MRI can highlight this very directed displacement of water. But segmenting the distinct bundles of axons in the brainstem has proved challenging, because they are small and masked by flows of brain fluids and the motions produced by breathing and heart beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of his thesis work to better understand the neural mechanisms that underpin consciousness, Olchanyi wanted to develop an AI algorithm to overcome these obstacles. BSBT works by tracing fiber bundles that plunge into the brainstem from neighboring areas higher in the brain, such as the thalamus and the cerebellum, to produce a “probabilistic fiber map.” An artificial intelligence module called a “convolutional neural network” then combines the map with several channels of imaging information from within the brainstem to distinguish eight individual bundles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To train the neural network to segment the bundles, Olchanyi “showed” it 30 live diffusion MRI scans from volunteers in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The scans were manually annotated to teach the neural network how to identify the bundles. Then he validated BSBT by testing its output against “ground truth” dissections of post-mortem human brains where the bundles were well delineated via microscopic inspection or very slow but ultra-high-resolution imaging. After training, BSBT became proficient in automatically identifying the eight distinct fiber bundles in new scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an experiment to test its consistency and reliability, Olchanyi tasked BSBT with finding the bundles in 40 volunteers who underwent separate scans two months apart. In each case, the tool was able to find the same bundles in the same patients in each of their two scans. Olchanyi also tested BSBT with multiple datasets (not just the HCP), and even inspected how each component of the neural network contributed to BSBT’s analysis by hobbling them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We put the neural network through the wringer,” Olchanyi says. “We wanted to make sure that it’s actually doing these plausible segmentations and it is leveraging each of its individual components in a way that improves the accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential novel biomarkers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the algorithm was properly trained and validated, the research team moved on to testing whether the ability to segment distinct fiber bundles in diffusion MRI scans could enable tracking of how each bundle’s volume and structure varied with disease or injury, creating a novel kind of biomarker. Although the brainstem has been difficult to examine in detail, many studies show that neurodegenerative diseases affect the brainstem, often early on in their progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olchanyi, Brown and their co-authors applied BSBT to scores of datasets of diffusion MRI scans from patients with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, MS, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients were compared to controls and sometimes to themselves over time. In the scans, the tool measured bundle volume and “fractional anisotropy,” (FA) which tracks how much water is flowing along the myelinated axons versus how much is diffusing in other directions, a proxy for white matter structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each condition, the tool found consistent patterns of changes in the bundles. While only one bundle showed significant decline in Alzheimer’s, in Parkinson’s the tool revealed a reduction in FA in three of the eight bundles. It also revealed volume loss in another bundle in patients between a baseline scan and a two-year follow-up. Patients with MS showed their greatest FA reductions in four bundles and volume loss in three. Meanwhile, TBI patients didn’t show significant volume loss in any bundles, but FA reductions were apparent in the majority of bundles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing in the study showed that BSBT proved more accurate than other classifier methods in discriminating between patients with health conditions versus controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BSBT, therefore, can be “a key adjunct that aids current diagnostic imaging methods by providing a fine-grained assessment of brainstem white matter structure and, in some cases, longitudinal information,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the case of a 29-year-old man who suffered a severe TBI, Olchanyi applied BSBT to a scans taken during the man’s seven-month coma. The tool showed that the man’s brainstem bundles had been displaced, but not cut, and showed that over his coma, the lesions on the nerve bundles decreased by a factor of three in volume. As they healed, the bundles moved back into place as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors wrote that BSBT “has substantial prognostic potential by identifying preserved brainstem bundles that can facilitate coma recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s other senior authors are Juan Eugenio Iglesias and Brian Edlow. Other co-authors are David Schreier, Jian Li, Chiara Maffei, Annabel Sorby-Adams, Hannah Kinney, Brian Healy, Holly Freeman, Jared Shless, Christophe Destrieux, and Hendry Tregidgo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for the study came from the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Defense, James S.

Although the brainstem has been difficult to examine in detail, many studies show that neurodegenerative diseases affect the brainstem, often early on in their progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olchanyi, Brown and their co-authors applied BSBT to scores of datasets of diffusion MRI scans from patients with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, MS, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients were compared to controls and sometimes to themselves over time. In the scans, the tool measured bundle volume and “fractional anisotropy,” (FA) which tracks how much water is flowing along the myelinated axons versus how much is diffusing in other directions, a proxy for white matter structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each condition, the tool found consistent patterns of changes in the bundles. While only one bundle showed significant decline in Alzheimer’s, in Parkinson’s the tool revealed a reduction in FA in three of the eight bundles. It also revealed volume loss in another bundle in patients between a baseline scan and a two-year follow-up. Patients with MS showed their greatest FA reductions in four bundles and volume loss in three. Meanwhile, TBI patients didn’t show significant volume loss in any bundles, but FA reductions were apparent in the majority of bundles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing in the study showed that BSBT proved more accurate than other classifier methods in discriminating between patients with health conditions versus controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BSBT, therefore, can be “a key adjunct that aids current diagnostic imaging methods by providing a fine-grained assessment of brainstem white matter structure and, in some cases, longitudinal information,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the case of a 29-year-old man who suffered a severe TBI, Olchanyi applied BSBT to a scans taken during the man’s seven-month coma. The tool showed that the man’s brainstem bundles had been displaced, but not cut, and showed that over his coma, the lesions on the nerve bundles decreased by a factor of three in volume. As they healed, the bundles moved back into place as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors wrote that BSBT “has substantial prognostic potential by identifying preserved brainstem bundles that can facilitate coma recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s other senior authors are Juan Eugenio Iglesias and Brian Edlow. Other co-authors are David Schreier, Jian Li, Chiara Maffei, Annabel Sorby-Adams, Hannah Kinney, Brian Healy, Holly Freeman, Jared Shless, Christophe Destrieux, and Hendry Tregidgo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for the study came from the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Defense, James S. McDonnell Foundation, Rappaport Foundation, American SidS Institute, American Brain Foundation, American Academy of Neurology, Center for Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology, Blueprint for Neuroscience Research, and Massachusetts Life Sciences Center.&lt;/p&gt;

But the sibling duo used AI music in their rhythm dance program, which doesn’t break any official rules, but serves as a depressing symbol of how absolutely cooked we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Mrázek spun his sister in a crazy cartwheel-lift-sort-of-move that made them look superhuman, one of the NBC commentators mentioned in passing, “This is AI generated, this first part,” referring to the music. Somehow, that admission is even more baffling than the gravity-defying tricks that the siblings showed off on the pressure of Olympic ice.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Olympic ice dance competition is split into two events: the rhythm dance, where pairs must perform a routine that meets a specific theme, and the free dance. This season’s theme is “The Music, Dance Styles, and Feeling of the 1990s.” British ice dancing duo Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson paid tribute to the Spice Girls, while United States favorites Madison Chock and Evan Bates skated to a Lenny Kravitz medley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But, for whatever reason — licensing issues? — Mrázková and Mrázek danced to a routine with music that’s half AC/DC and half AI. It’s weird. What’s even weirder is that this isn’t the duo’s first use of AI, nor is it the first time that this choice backfired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Per the International Skating Union, the governing body that oversees competitive ice skating, the duo’s music choice for the rhythm dance this season has been “One Two by AI (of 90s style Bon Jovi)” and “Thunderstruck by AC/DC.” The official Olympics website confirms that the duo is using the AI-generated song for the rhythm dance portion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Czech siblings have faced backlash before for using AI-generated music. Earlier in the season, they played a ’90s-inspired song for their routine that began with a wailing declaration: “Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz!” If that sounds familiar, it’s because that lyric comes directly from the ’90s hit “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals (which, by the way, has an incredible music video shot in a Staten Island mall — the true essence of American suburbia!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI-generated lyrics also include the lines, “Wake up, kids/We got the dreamer’s disease,” and “First we run, and then we laugh ’til we cry.” What a coincidence! Those lyrics also appear in the song “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals. The AI song is even titled “One Two,” which are the first words of… you can probably guess which song at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before the Olympics, the duo changed the song, swapping out the New Radicals lyrics for other AI-generated lyrics that sound suspiciously like Bon Jovi lyrics, as journalist Shana Bartels noted in November. For example, “raise your hands, set the night on fire” also appear in “Raise Your Hands” by Bon Jovi… and the AI “vocalist” sounds a lot like Bon Jovi, too. (Not to pour salt on the wound, but “Raise Your Hands” isn’t even from the ’90s!) This was the music that the duo danced to on Monday at the Olympics, before it transitioned into “Thunderstruck” by AC/DC, a real song from the ’90s written by real people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While it’s unclear what software the team used to generate this music, this is an LLM operating as it’s supposed to. These LLMs are trained on large libraries of music, often through legally dubious means. When prompted, LLMs produce the most statistically probable response to an input. That’s useful when writing code, but means a song “in the style of Bon Jovi,” will likely end up using some actual Bon Jovi lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And yet, the music industry seems at least temporarily enamored with the idea of “musicians” who aren’t totally real. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to set her (hopefully real) poetry to music under the persona Xania Monet. Now she has a $3 million record deal.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a shame that these Czech dancers’ accomplishment of skating at the Olympics may be marred by discourse around their use of AI music (discourse that I am actively contributing to).

Now, as tech companies look for legally safe sources of AI training data, Amazon is reportedly considering launching a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Information reported Monday that the e-commerce giant has been meeting with publishing executives and alerting them to its plans to launch such a marketplace. Ahead of an AWS conference for publishers that occurred Tuesday, Amazon “circulated slides that mention a content marketplace,” wrote the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Reached by TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson didn’t deny the story but didn’t directly address the would-be marketplace either, saying only: “Amazon has built long-lasting, innovative relationships with publishers across many areas of our business, including AWS, Retail, Advertising, AGI, and Alexa. We are always innovating together to best serve our customers, but we have nothing specific to share on this subject at this time.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon wouldn’t be the first major tech company to take this route. Microsoft recently launched what it calls a Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), which it says will give publishers “a new revenue stream” while also providing AI systems with “scaled access to premium content.” Microsoft added that the PCM was designed to “empower publishers with a transparent economic framework for licensing” their content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move is a natural next step for the AI industry, which has already sought to solve the legally nebulous problem of how copyrighted material ends up in AI training data by forging deals with major news outlets and media organizations. OpenAI, for instance, has already signed content-licensing partnerships with the Associated Press, Vox Media, News Corp, and The Atlantic, among others. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those efforts haven’t been enough to stem the legal fallout. The fight over copyrighted material in AI algorithms has led to a monsoon of lawsuits, and the issue is still being worked out by the judicial system. New regulatory strategies to deal with the issue are being proposed all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Media publishers have also fretted about the ways in which AI summaries — particularly those surfaced by Google in its search results — may be depressing traffic to their sites. One recent study claimed that such summaries have had a “devastating” impact on the number of users clicking through to websites. The Information’s report notes that publishers may view the new marketplace-based content-sharing system as a “more sustainable business [than current, more limited licensing partnerships] that will scale up revenue” as AI usage continues to escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Less than a day later, on Tuesday afternoon, xAI co-founder Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said that he, too, is bouncing, posting a gracious note on X on his way out. “Enormous thanks to @elonmusk for bringing us together on this incredible journey. So proud of what the xAI team has done and will continue to stay close as a friend of the team,” it read in part.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On their own, both were pretty standard tech departure announcements — but they’re part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Six members of the company’s 12-person founding team have now left the company, with five of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkin left to found a venture firm, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month, citing health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with bizarre behavior and apparent internal tampering — the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that flooded the platform with deepfake pornography, sparking slow-moving but real legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already spinning up plans for orbital data centers, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn’t slowing down, and if Grok can’t keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with bizarre behavior and apparent internal tampering — the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that flooded the platform with deepfake pornography, sparking slow-moving but real legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already spinning up plans for orbital data centers, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn’t slowing down, and if Grok can’t keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The allegation that I discriminated against anyone is absolutely false,” Beiermeister told the Journal. TechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for comment and also contacted an email that appears to be associated with Beiermeister; neither had responded at the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Per the Journal’s report, Beiermeister’s termination came after she expressed criticism of a planned ChatGPT feature dubbed “adult mode.” The new mode would introduce erotica into the chatbot user experience. Fidji Simo, who serves as OpenAI’s CEO of Applications — a role overseeing the company’s consumer-facing products — has told reporters that the new feature is planned to launch during the first quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beiermeister and others at the company have raised concerns about how the new “adult” feature could potentially impact certain users, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI reportedly said that Beiermeister, who was fired following a leave of absence, had&amp;nbsp;“made valuable contributions during her time at OpenAI, and her departure was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beiermeister’s LinkedIn profile says she previously worked for four years on Meta’s product team and spent more than seven years working for Palantir.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2195918462.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Ryan Beiermeister, who served as OpenAI’s vice president of product policy, was fired in January after a male colleague accused her of sex discrimination, the Wall Street Journal has reported.&lt;/p&gt;
