&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Letters&amp;nbsp;from the Parliament’s office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) disclosing Sunak’s appointments revealed concerns that the ex-Conservative PM’s privileged information could “grant Microsoft an unfair advantage.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sunak has some history with Microsoft, which has several active contracts with British government departments. In 2023, he&amp;nbsp;unveiled a £2.5 billion deal with&amp;nbsp;Microsoft&amp;nbsp;to invest in new data centers and training in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Acoba also&amp;nbsp;noted&amp;nbsp;that “there is a reasonable concern that your appointment could be seen to offer unfair access and influence within the U.K. government…given the ongoing debate about how to best regulate AI, and at a time of intense debate and lobbying around the world on what the approach should be.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sunak said he would steer clear on advising on U.K. policy matters, stick to high-level perspectives on macro-economic and geopolitical trends, and avoid lobbying. He said he would divert his salary to the Richmond Project, a charity he founded with his wife earlier this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The former PM also serves as a senior advisor to investment bank Goldman Sachs and speech writer for firms like Bain Capital and Makena Capital.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sunak&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;the first British politician to take on roles helping Silicon Valley tech giants navigate governmental affairs. Sunak’s senior political adviser, Liam Booth-Smith, is also on Anthropic’s payroll. And former Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg served as Meta’s president of global affairs until January 2025. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;OpenAI will finally stop saving most ChatGPT users' deleted and temporary chats after a court fight compelled the AI firm to retain the logs "indefinitely."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preservation order came in a lawsuit filed by The New York Times and other news plaintiffs, who alleged that user attempts to skirt paywalls with ChatGPT would most likely set their chats as temporary or delete the logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI vowed to fight the order, defending its policies and users' privacy, but it lost. By July, news plaintiffs started digging through the logs—which only preserved ChatGPT's outputs—while a few ChatGPT users' efforts to intervene were consistently denied, as they were deemed non-parties to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an order on Thursday, US Magistrate Judge Ona Wang approved a joint motion from news organizations and OpenAI to terminate the preservation order, although some ChatGPT users' deleted and temporary chats will still be monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, OpenAI was allowed to stop the controversial practice of preserving "all output log data that would otherwise be deleted" on September 26.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, all of the deleted and temporary chats that were previously saved under the preservation order will continue to be accessible to news plaintiffs, who are looking for examples of outputs infringing their articles or attributing misinformation to their publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, OpenAI will continue monitoring certain ChatGPT accounts, saving deleted and temporary chats of any users whose domains have been flagged by news organizations since they began searching through the data. If news plaintiffs flag additional domains during future meetings with OpenAI, more accounts could be roped in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars could not immediately reach OpenAI or the Times' legal team for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute with news plaintiffs continues to heat up beyond the battle over user logs, most recently with co-defendant Microsoft pushing to keep its AI companion Copilot out of the litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakes remain high for both sides. News organizations have alleged that ChatGPT and other allegedly copyright-infringing tools threaten to replace them in their market while potentially damaging their reputations by attributing false information to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI may be increasingly pressured to settle the lawsuit, and not by news organizations but by insurance companies that won't provide comprehensive coverage for their AI products with multiple potentially multibillion-dollar lawsuits pending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several companies have launched their interactive experiences, including Spotify, allowing listeners to ask ChatGPT to create playlists, recommend songs, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When you mention Spotify in your ChatGPT prompt, you’ll have the option to connect your account. A button that says “Use Spotify for this answer” will appear at the bottom of the page. Connecting your account allows the AI to access your data, such as your likes and listening history, providing relevant context that helps generate better answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056403" height="357" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chatgpt-spotify.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;ChatGPT (screenshot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;From there, you can ask it for recommendations for tracks, artists, playlists, or podcast episodes based on your tastes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can be as detailed as you want in your prompts. For instance, you can create a playlist with a specific mood in mind, choose the event you want the playlist for, or request to include only your most listened-to artists, your top favorite genre, and so on. It also asks you for the preferred length, which is helpful for planning a long road trip playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During our testing, we asked it to create a dog-walking playlist but all the songs needed to have “Dog” in the title. Here is what it came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056420" height="380" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-10-at-11.16.56AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Spotify (screenshot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tapping a suggested track or podcast episode will open the Spotify app, allowing you to listen or watch directly from there.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT also has the capability to perform actions on your behalf within Spotify, including controlling playback; adding and removing items from your library; creating, editing, and following private playlists; and managing your following list.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s important to note that when you’re connecting your Spotify account, you agree to the app’s privacy policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This policy includes important information about data sharing and security, stating that if ChatGPT experiences a security breach, there is a risk that your data could be accessed by unauthorized parties. In addition to giving ChatGPT access to data — such as what songs and podcasts you’re playing, what is saved in your Spotify library, and who you follow — you’re also providing your IP address and approximate location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, you can disconnect your Spotify account at any time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, Spotify explained in a blog post that it doesn’t share content from artists and creators with OpenAI for training purposes. All music, podcasts, or any other audio or video content on the platform stays protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056402" height="373" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spotify-chatgpt-privacy.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Spotify (screenshot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature is available in English across 145 countries for all ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro users on web and mobile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both free and premium Spotify users can use the integration; however, the company says premium users get a more tailored experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other companies have also integrated their apps into ChatGPT, including Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, and Zillow. The integrations allow you to, for example, ask Coursera to teach you something or search on Zillow for apartments in your area within a specific price range.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Earlier this week, OpenAI launched a way for developers to build apps within ChatGPT, allowing users to prompt the assistant to perform tasks and answer questions directly related to the participating apps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

However, he also admitted that bad actors will use the technology for “nefarious purposes” and that kids growing up today will have to be taught that you can’t believe something just because you saw a video of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Meta executive shared his thoughts on how AI is impacting the creator industry at the Bloomberg Screentime conference this week. At the interview’s start, Mosseri was asked to address the recent comments from creator MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson). On Threads, MrBeast had suggested that AI-generated videos could soon threaten creators’ livelihoods and said it was “scary times” for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mosseri pushed back a bit at that idea, noting that most creators won’t be using AI technology to reproduce what MrBeast has historically done, with his huge sets and elaborate productions; instead, it will allow creators to do more and make better content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you take a big step back, what the internet did, among other things, was allow almost anyone to become a publisher by reducing the cost of distributing content to essentially zero,” Mosseri explained. “And what some of these generative AI models look like they’re going to do is they’re going to reduce the cost of producing content to basically zero,” he said. (This, of course, does not reflect the true financial, environmental, and human costs of using AI, which are substantial.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, the exec suggested that there’s already a lot of “hybrid” content on today’s big social platforms, where creators are using AI in their workflow but not producing fully synthetic content. For instance, they might be using AI tools for color corrections or filters. Going forward, Mosseri said, the line between what’s real and what’s AI generated will become even more blurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s going to be a little bit less like, what is organic content and what is AI synthetic content, and what the percentages are. I think there’s gonna be actually more in the middle than pure synthetic content for a while,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As things change, Mosseri said Meta has some responsibility to do more in terms of identifying what content is AI generated. But he also noted that the way the company had gone about this wasn’t the “right focus” and was practically “a fool’s errand.” He was referring to how Meta had initially tried to label AI content automatically, which led to a situation where it was labeling real content as AI, because AI tools, including those from Adobe, were used as part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;

													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The executive said that the labeling system needs more work but that Meta should also provide more context that helps people make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While he didn’t elaborate on what that newly added context would be, he may have been thinking about Meta’s Community Notes feature, which is the crowdsourced fact-checking system launched in the U.S. this year, modeled on the one X uses. Instead of turning to third-party fact checkers, Community Notes and similar systems mark content with corrections or additional context when users who often share opposing opinions agree that a fact-check or further explanation is needed. It’s likely that Meta could be weighing the use of such a system for flagging when something is AI generated but hasn’t been labeled as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rather than saying it was fully the platform’s responsibility to label AI content, Mosseri suggested that society itself would have to change. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“My kids are young. They’re nine, seven, and five. I need them to understand, as they grow up and they get exposed to the internet, that just because they’re seeing a video of something doesn’t mean it actually happened,” he explained. “When I grew up, and I saw a video, I could assume that that was a capture of a moment that happened in the real world,” Mosseri continued. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What they’re going to&amp;nbsp;… need to think about who is saying it, who’s sharing it, in this case, and what are their incentives, and why might they be saying it,” he concluded. (That seems like a heavy mental load for young children, but alas.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the discussion, Mosseri also touched on other topics about the future of Instagram beyond AI, including its plans for a dedicated TV app and its newer focus on Reels and DMs as its core features (which Mosseri said just reflected user trends), and how TikTok’s changing ownership in the U.S. will impact the competitive landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the latter, he said that, ultimately, it’s better to have competition, as TikTok’s U.S. presence has forced Instagram to “do better work.” As for the TikTok deal itself, Mosseri said it’s hard to parse, but it seems like how the app has been built will not meaningfully change.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s the same app, the same ranking system, the same creators that you’re following — the same people. It’s all sort of seamless,” Mosseri said of the “new” TikTok U.S. operation. “It doesn’t seem like it’s a major change in terms of incentives,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/adam-mosseri-at-bloomberg-screentime.png?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Instagram head Adam Mosseri said AI will change who can be creative, as the new tools and technology will give people who couldn’t be creators before the ability to produce content at a certain quality and scale.

It’s all sort of seamless,” Mosseri said of the “new” TikTok U.S. operation. “It doesn’t seem like it’s a major change in terms of incentives,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/instagram-head-adam-mosseri-pushes-back-on-mrbeasts-ai-fears-but-admits-society-will-have-to-adjust/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 15:55:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Building connected data ecosystems for AI at scale (Artificial intelligence – MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/10/1124313/building-connected-data-ecosystems-for-ai-at-scale/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iStock-853701224.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="sponsoredModule__wrapper--c8f6fcf4edb2dcd3a940a2824bb850dc sponsoredModule__minimalist--f63b84a37007076f51d0ebb0dc1af42f"&gt;&lt;p class="sponsoredModule__intro--e69c514244f1e38617e4ec5ea754fb7f"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In partnership with&lt;/span&gt;SAP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="image__wrapper--373a87c0cefdc42b3a8bd26457571412"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background opacity"&gt;&lt;span class="image__img--e1a73f503bf0f4a3d2504e1d64ea29cb imgLazyLoaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image__meta--16eb0f8dde685315ba1d77ae67c89391"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iStock-853701224.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="sponsoredModule__wrapper--c8f6fcf4edb2dcd3a940a2824bb850dc sponsoredModule__minimalist--f63b84a37007076f51d0ebb0dc1af42f"&gt;&lt;p class="sponsoredModule__intro--e69c514244f1e38617e4ec5ea754fb7f"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In partnership with&lt;/span&gt;SAP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="image__wrapper--373a87c0cefdc42b3a8bd26457571412"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background opacity"&gt;&lt;span class="image__img--e1a73f503bf0f4a3d2504e1d64ea29cb imgLazyLoaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image__meta--16eb0f8dde685315ba1d77ae67c89391"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/10/1124313/building-connected-data-ecosystems-for-ai-at-scale/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 16:11:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Prezent raises $30 million to acquire AI services firms — starting with founder’s other company (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/prezent-raises-30-million-to-acquire-ai-services-firms-starting-with-founders-other-company/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Prezent, a startup that offers an AI-powered presentation builder to enterprises, said today that it has raised $30 million in funding led by Multiplier Capital, Greycroft, and Nomura Strategic Ventures, with participation from existing investors like Emergent Ventures, WestWave Capital, and Alumni Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Los Altos, California, startup, which is now valued at $400 million, has raised over $74 million to date. It plans to use the new capital largely for acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has also made its first acquisition, buying Prezentium, founded by Deepti Juturu, a services-led presentation company that operates in the life sciences vertical. In an unusual arrangement, Prezent founder Rajat Mishra was one of the co-founders of Prezentium. Mishra said that since the beginning of his new startup, he has been the non-operating president of Prezentium. Both startups already have an existing relationship, as Prezent uses Prezentium as a go-to-market partner. The acquisition essentially brings Mishra’s two ventures under one roof, allowing Prezent to use Prezentium’s client base to offer its own AI suite to more customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056349" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Prezent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are plenty of companies trying to create AI-powered presentation-building tools, including Presentations.ai, Lica, Gamma, and Chronicle. Notably, all these companies have Accel as a backer. While most of them focus on consumers and small business users, Prezent wants to stick to an enterprise strategy, targeting larger corporations. Previously, the company stated that it wants to expand its offerings to different verticals, including finance and manufacturing. However, Mishra noted that for now, the company wants to focus on serving clients in the life sciences and tech industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There are plenty of tools that are trying to make presentations pretty. We want to provide the best tools for business communications. I think presentation is one of the frontiers in businesses that is not automated yet. We want to help data scientists and designers to communicate effectively with this automation,” Mishra told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056487" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Prezent founder Rajat Mishra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Prezent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mishra, who previously worked at McKinsey, said that the company is taking a specialized approach to training AI models for presentations for each specific industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Prezent places a presentation engineer, who is familiar with the industry and the startup’s own offerings, in enterprises to help different people within the company get used to building presentations with AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The reality of AI in enterprise is that while AI can do many things, it can’t teach people [how] to use AI. That is why we want to place presentation engineers in companies to help our customers adopt the product faster,” Mishra said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056350" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_auto-generator_laptop@2x.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Prezent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI startups are looking to acquire services companies to take advantage of existing customer bases and also provide better customization to enterprise clients. Digital avatar startup D-ID acquired Berlin-based video startup Simpleshow, and Google-backed legal tech startup Lawhive acquired a U.K.-based law firm. With these acquisitions, AI startups want to combine their AI tools with the existing domain expertise and client service capabilities of services firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Prezent wants to build more partnerships and acquire suitable companies in sectors like executive communication coaching, medical writing, and consulting firms in the communication area. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mark Terbeek, a partner at Greycroft who has invested in multiple rounds in Prezent, said that the venture firm likes to find the areas where businesses have used costly agencies in the past to fulfill a need, and now there are AI tools available trying to do the same tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We felt that Rajat and Prezent were concentrating hard on solving specific customer needs of business communications. Plus, we saw software evolve quickly to adjust to the workflows of end users and help them save time,” he told TechCrunch over a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Going forward, Prezent wants to add better personalization to its product so the AI tool learns the style of each individual in the organization. It also wants to add multimodality capabilities to deck creations, allowing users to use text, voice, or video as input to make presentations.

On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size" id="h-microsoft-s-1-billion-investment-in-openai"&gt;Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size" id="h-the-rise-of-oracle"&gt;The rise of Oracle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle a spot alongside Google as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company’s stock went shooting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A few months later, it happened again. On September 10, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle’s stock climbed even higher, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-s-investment-spree"&gt;Nvidia’s investment spree&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they’re mostly all buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it’s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, the company bought a 4% stake in rival Intel for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI’s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk’s xAI, and OpenAI launched a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement with AMD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If that seems circular, it should. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI’s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can’t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size" id="h-building-tomorrow-s-hyperscale-data-centers"&gt;Building tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For companies like Meta that already have significant legacy infrastructure, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In just the first half of 2025, the company spent $30 billion more than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent $10 billion deal with Google Cloud, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, dubbed Hyperion, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that experts say violate the Clean Air Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size" id="h-the-stargate-moonshot"&gt;The Stargate moonshot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just two days after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. In August, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of eight data centers in Abilene, Texas, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size" id="h-microsoft-s-1-billion-investment-in-openai"&gt;Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size" id="h-the-rise-of-oracle"&gt;The rise of Oracle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle a spot alongside Google as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company’s stock went shooting up.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A few months later, it happened again. On September 10, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle’s stock climbed even higher, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-s-investment-spree"&gt;Nvidia’s investment spree&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they’re mostly all buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it’s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, the company bought a 4% stake in rival Intel for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI’s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk’s xAI, and OpenAI launched a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement with AMD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If that seems circular, it should. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI’s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can’t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size" id="h-building-tomorrow-s-hyperscale-data-centers"&gt;Building tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For companies like Meta that already have significant legacy infrastructure, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In just the first half of 2025, the company spent $30 billion more than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent $10 billion deal with Google Cloud, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, dubbed Hyperion, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that experts say violate the Clean Air Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size" id="h-the-stargate-moonshot"&gt;The Stargate moonshot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just two days after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. In August, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of eight data centers in Abilene, Texas, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;AI companies are making their much-anticipated enterprise plays, but the results are wildly inconsistent. Just this week, Deloitte announced it’s rolling out Anthropic’s Claude to all 500,000 employees. On the very same day, the Australian government forced Deloitte to refund a contract because their AI-generated report was riddled with fake citations. It’s a perfect snapshot of where we are: companies racing to adopt AI tools before they’ve figured out how to use them responsibly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On this episode of Equity, Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and Sean O’Kane dig into the messy reality of AI in the workplace, plus funding news and regulatory drama across tech and transportation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
