&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That terse message —&amp;nbsp; placed right below a note that “animal wranglers were on set to ensure animal safety” — could potentially provide a model for other filmmakers seeking to highlight that their work was made without the use of generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And just in case the disclaimer wasn’t clear enough, creator Vince Gilligan (best known for “Breaking Bad”) was even more emphatic in a Variety feature story about the show, declaring flatly, “I hate AI.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He went on to describe the technology as “the world’s most expensive and energy-intensive plagiarism machine” and compared AI-generated content to “a cow chewing its cud — an endlessly regurgitated loop of nonsense.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Thank you, Silicon Valley!” he added. “Yet again, you’ve f—ed up the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Pluribus” is the former “X-Files” writer’s return to science fiction, and it reunites him with his “Better Call Saul” star Rhea Seehorn, who plays a romantasy author confronting an alien invasion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pluribus.jpeg?resize=1200,803" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;If you watched all the way to the end of the new Apple TV show “Pluribus,” you may have noticed an unusual disclaimer in the credits: “This show was made by humans.”&lt;/p&gt;

(AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/08/is-wall-street-losing-faith-in-ai/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A rough week for tech stocks might signal a loss of investor confidence in artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Wall Street Journal reports that the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 3% — making this its worst week since President Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariff plan in April.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech companies that have otherwise performed well this year were among those hardest hit, with Palantir’s stock price falling 11% this week, Oracle declining by 9%, and Nvidia losing 7%. These drops also come after earnings reports in which Meta and Microsoft indicated that they plan to continue spending heavily on AI (both companies were down about 4%).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Valuations are stretched,” Cresset Capital’s Jack Ablin told the WSJ. “Just the slightest bit of bad news gets exaggerated … and good news is just not enough to move the needle because expectations are already pretty high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Economic factors like the ongoing government shutdown, declining consumer sentiment, and widespread layoffs are also likely dragging down the stock market. But the less tech-heavy S&amp;amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average didn’t do quite as badly, with declines of 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A rough week for tech stocks might signal a loss of investor confidence in artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
