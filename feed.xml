The letter is a strategic signal to enterprise engineering leaders: CIOs, CTOs, AI leads, platform architects and security directors. Nadella outlines the direction of Microsoft’s innovation, but also what it expects from its customers and partners. The AI era is here, but it will be built by those who combine technical vision with operational discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are the five most important takeaways for enterprise technical decision makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Security and reliability are now the foundation of the AI stack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella makes security the first priority in the letter and ties it directly to Microsoft’s relevance going forward. Through its Secure Future Initiative (SFI), Microsoft has assigned the equivalent of 34,000 engineers to secure its identity systems, networks and software supply chain. Its Quality Excellence Initiative (QEI) aims to increase platform resiliency and strengthen global service uptime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s positioning makes it clear that enterprises will no longer get away with “ship fast, harden later” AI deployments. Nadella calls security “non-negotiable,” signaling that AI infrastructure must now meet the standards of mission-critical software. That means identity-first architecture, zero-trust execution environments and change management discipline are now table stakes for enterprise AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. AI infrastructure strategy is hybrid, open and sovereignty-ready&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella commits Microsoft to building “planet-scale systems” and backs that up with numbers: more than 400 Azure datacenters across 70 regions, two gigawatts of new compute capacity added this year, and new liquid-cooled GPU clusters rolling out across Azure. Microsoft also introduced Fairwater, a massive new AI datacenter in Wisconsin positioned to deliver unprecedented scale. Just as important, Microsoft is now officially multi-model. Azure AI Foundry offers access to more than 11,000 models including OpenAI, Meta, Mistral, Cohere and xAI. Microsoft is no longer pushing a single-model future, but a hybrid AI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises should interpret this as validation of “portfolio architectures,” where closed, open and domain-specific models coexist. Nadella also emphasizes growing investment in sovereign cloud offerings for regulated industries, previewing a world where AI systems will have to meet regional data residency and compliance requirements from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. AI agents—not just chatbots—are now Microsoft’s future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI shift inside Microsoft is no longer about copilots that answer questions. It is now about AI agents that perform work. Nadella points to the rollout of Agent Mode in Microsoft 365 Copilot, which turns natural language requests into multistep business workflows. GitHub Copilot evolves from code autocomplete into a “peer programmer” capable of executing tasks asynchronously. In security operations, Microsoft has deployed AI agents that autonomously respond to incidents. In healthcare, Copilot for Dragon Medical documents clinical encounters automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a major architectural pivot. Enterprises will need to move beyond prompt-response interfaces and begin engineering agent ecosystems that safely take actions inside business systems. That requires workflow orchestration, API integration strategies and strong guardrails. Nadella’s letter frames this as the next software platform shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Unified data platforms are required to unlock AI value&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella devotes significant attention to &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/enterprise-ai-success-is-about-more-than-just-data-its-about-knowledge-heres"&gt;Microsoft Fabric&lt;/a&gt; and OneLake, calling Fabric the company’s fastest-growing data and analytics product ever. Fabric promises to centralize enterprise data from multiple cloud and analytics environments. OneLake provides a universal storage layer that binds analytics and AI workloads together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s message is blunt: siloed data means stalled AI. Enterprise teams that want AI at scale must unify operational and analytical data into a single architecture, enforce consistent data contracts and standardize metadata governance. AI success is now a data engineering problem more than a model problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Trust, compliance and responsible AI are now mandatory for deployment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People want technology they can trust,” Nadella writes. Microsoft now publishes Responsible AI Transparency Reports and aligns parts of its development process with UN human rights guidance. Microsoft is also committing to digital resilience in Europe and proactive safeguards against misuse of AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shifts responsible AI out of the realm of corporate messaging and into engineering practice. Enterprises will need model documentation, reproducibility practices, audit trails, risk monitoring and human-in-the-loop checkpoints. Nadella signals that compliance will become integrated with product delivery—not an afterthought layered on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The real meaning of Microsoft’s AI strategy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these five pillars send a clear message to enterprise leaders: AI maturity is no longer about building prototypes or proving use cases. System-level readiness now defines success. Nadella frames Microsoft’s mission as helping customers “think in decades and execute in quarters,” and that is more than corporate poetry. It is a call to build AI platforms engineered for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies that win in enterprise AI will be the ones that invest early in secure cloud foundations, unify their data architectures, enable agent-based workflows and embrace responsible AI as a prerequisite for scale—not a press release. Nadella is betting that the next industrial transformation will be powered by AI infrastructure, not AI demos.

Doing this on your stove would be slower than this.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godart is the founder and CEO of Found Energy, a startup in Boston that aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale. Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which Godart claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early next year, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel. (The manufacturer did not want to be named until the project is formally announced.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. The high heat generated by the engine could be especially valuable to reduce the substantial greenhouse-gas emissions generated by industrial processes, like cement production and metal refining, that are difficult to power with electricity directly.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We invented the fuel, which is a blessing and a curse,” says Godart, surrounded by the pipes and wires of the experimental reactor. “It’s a huge opportunity for us, but it also means we do have to develop all of the systems around us. We’re redefining what even is an engine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Engineers have long eyed using aluminum as a fuel thanks to its superior energy density. Once it has been refined and smelted from ore, aluminum metal contains more than twice as much energy as diesel fuel by volume and almost eight times as much as hydrogen gas. When it reacts with oxygen in water or air, it forms aluminum oxides. This reaction releases heat and hydrogen gas, which can be tapped for zero-carbon power.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Liquid metal&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The trouble with aluminum as a fuel—and the reason your soda can doesn’t spontaneously combust—is that as soon as the metal starts to react, an oxidized layer forms across its surface that prevents the rest of it from reacting. It’s like a fire that puts itself out as it generates ash. “People have tried it and abandoned this idea many, many times,” says Godart.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some believe using aluminum as a fuel remains a fool’s errand. “This potential use of aluminum crops up every few years and has no possibility of success even if aluminum scrap is used as the fuel source,” says Geoff Scamans, a metallurgist at Brunel University of London who spent a decade working on using aluminum to power vehicles in the 1980s. He says the aluminum-water reaction isn’t efficient enough for the metal to make sense as a fuel given how much energy it takes to refine and smelt aluminum from ore to begin with: “A crazy idea is always a crazy idea.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Godart believes he and his company have found a way to make it work. “The real breakthrough was thinking about catalysis in a different way,” he says: Instead of trying to speed up the reaction by bringing water and aluminum together onto a catalyst, they “flipped it around” and “found a material that we could actually dissolve into the aluminum.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Petert Godart holding up two glass jars; one with metal spheres and the other with flat metal shapes" class="wp-image-1125729" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7710_JamesDinneen.jpg?w=2830" width="2830" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JAMES DINNEEN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The liquid metal catalyst at the heart of the company’s approach “permeates the microstructure” of the aluminum, says Godart. As the aluminum reacts with water, the catalyst forces the metal to froth and split open, exposing more unreacted aluminum to the water.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The composition of the catalyst is proprietary, but Godart says it is a “low-melting-point liquid metal that’s not mercury.” His dissertation research focused on using a liquid mixture of gallium and indium as the catalyst, and he says the principle behind the current material is the same.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During a visit in early October, Godart demonstrated the central reaction in the Found R&amp;amp;D lab, which after the company’s $12 million seed round last year now fills the better part of two floors of an industrial building in Boston’s Charlestown neighborhood. Using a pair of tongs to avoid starting the reaction with the moisture on his fingers, he placed a pellet of aluminum treated with the secret catalyst in a beaker and then added water. Immediately, the metal began to bubble with hydrogen. Then the water steamed away, leaving behind a frothing gray mass of aluminum hydroxide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core-embed_7"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One of the impediments to this technology taking off is that [the aluminum-water reaction] was just too sluggish,” says Godart. “But you can see here we’re making steam. We just made a boiler.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Europa to Earth&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godart was a scientist at NASA when he first started thinking about fresh ways to unlock the energy stored in aluminum. He was working on building aluminum robots that could consume themselves for fuel when roving on Jupiter’s icy moon Europa. But that work was cut short when Congress reduced funding for the mission.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“I was sort of having this little mini crisis where I was like, I need to do something about climate change, about Earth problems,” says Godart. “And I was like, you know—I bet this aluminum technology would be even better for Earth applications.” After completing a dissertation on aluminum fuels at MIT, he started Found Energy in his house in Cambridge in 2022 (the next year, he earned a place on &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s annual 35 Innovators under 35 list).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until this year, the company was working at a tiny scale, tweaking the catalyst and testing different conditions within a small 10-kilowatt reactor to make the reaction release more heat and hydrogen more quickly. Then, in January, it began designing an engine that’s 10 times larger, big enough to supply a useful amount of power for industrial processes beyond the lab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This larger engine took up most of the lab on the second floor. The reactor vessel resembled a water boiler turned on its side, with piping and wires connected to monitoring equipment that took up almost as much space as the engine itself. On one end, there was a pipe to inject water and a piston to deliver pellets of aluminum fuel into the reactor at variable rates. On the other end, outflow pipes carried away the reaction products: steam, hydrogen gas, aluminum hydroxide, and the recovered catalyst. Godart says none of the catalyst is lost in the reaction, so it can be used again to make more fuel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1126431" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IntheLab-07-1_0cb1e5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company first switched on the engine to begin testing in July. In September, it managed to power it up to its targeted power of 100 kilowatts—roughly as much as can be supplied by the diesel engine in a small pickup truck. In early 2026, it plans to install the 100-kilowatt engine to supply heat and hydrogen to the tool manufacturing facility. This pilot project is meant to serve as the proof of concept needed to raise the money for a 1-megawatt reactor, 10 times larger again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial pilot will use the engine to supply hot steam and hydrogen. But the energy released in the reactor could be put to use in a variety of ways across a range of temperatures, according to Godart. The hot steam could spin a turbine to produce electricity, or the hydrogen could produce electricity in a fuel cell. By burning the hydrogen within the steam, the engine can produce superheated steam as hot as 1,300 °C, which could be used to generate electricity more efficiently or refine chemicals. Burning the hydrogen alone could generate temperatures of 2,400 °C, hot enough to make steel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Picking up scrap&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godart says he and his colleagues hope the engine will eventually power many different industrial processes, but the initial target is the aluminum refining and recycling industry itself, as it already handles scrap metal and aluminum oxide supply chains. “Aluminum recyclers are coming to us, asking us to take their aluminum waste that’s difficult to recycle and then turn that into clean heat that they can use to re-melt other aluminum,” he says. “They are begging us to implement this for them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Citing nondisclosure agreements, he wouldn’t name any of the companies offering up their unrecyclable aluminum, which he says is something of a “dirty secret” for an industry that’s supposed to be recycling all it collects. But estimates from the International Aluminium Institute, an industry group, suggest that globally a little over 3 million metric tons of aluminum collected for recycling currently goes unrecycled each year; another 9 million metric tons isn’t collected for recycling at all or is incinerated with other waste. Together, that’s a little under a third of the estimated 43 million metric tons of aluminum scrap that currently gets recycled each year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if all that unused scrap was recovered for fuel, it would still supply only a fraction of the overall industrial demand for heat, let alone the overall industrial demand for energy. But the plan isn’t to be limited by available scrap. Eventually, Godart says, the hope is to “recharge” the aluminum hydroxide that comes out of the reactor by using clean electricity to convert it back into aluminum metal and react it again.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;According to the company’s estimates, this “closed loop” approach could supply all global demand for industrial heat by using and reusing a total of around 300 million metric tons of aluminum—around 4% of Earth’s abundant aluminum reserves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;However, all that recharging would require a lot of energy. “If you’re doing that, [aluminum fuel] is an energy storage technology, not so much an energy providing technology,” says Jeffrey Rissman, who studies industrial decarbonization at Energy Innovation, a think tank in California. As with other forms of energy storage like thermal batteries or green hydrogen, he says, that could still make sense if the fuel can be recharged using low-cost, clean electricity. But that will be increasingly hard to come by amid the scramble for clean power for everything from AI data centers to heat pumps.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite these obstacles, Godart is confident his company will find a way to make it work. The existing engine may already be able to squeeze out more power from aluminum than anticipated. “We actually believe this can probably do half a megawatt,” he says. “We haven’t fully throttled it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Dinneen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a science and environmental journalist based in New York City.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The crushed-up soda can disappears in a cloud of steam and—though it’s not visible—hydrogen gas. “I can just keep this reaction going by adding more water,” says Peter Godart, squirting some into the steaming beaker. “This is room-temperature water, and it’s immediately boiling. Doing this on your stove would be slower than this.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godart is the founder and CEO of Found Energy, a startup in Boston that aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale. Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which Godart claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early next year, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel. (The manufacturer did not want to be named until the project is formally announced.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. The high heat generated by the engine could be especially valuable to reduce the substantial greenhouse-gas emissions generated by industrial processes, like cement production and metal refining, that are difficult to power with electricity directly.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We invented the fuel, which is a blessing and a curse,” says Godart, surrounded by the pipes and wires of the experimental reactor. “It’s a huge opportunity for us, but it also means we do have to develop all of the systems around us. We’re redefining what even is an engine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Engineers have long eyed using aluminum as a fuel thanks to its superior energy density. Once it has been refined and smelted from ore, aluminum metal contains more than twice as much energy as diesel fuel by volume and almost eight times as much as hydrogen gas. When it reacts with oxygen in water or air, it forms aluminum oxides. This reaction releases heat and hydrogen gas, which can be tapped for zero-carbon power.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Liquid metal&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The trouble with aluminum as a fuel—and the reason your soda can doesn’t spontaneously combust—is that as soon as the metal starts to react, an oxidized layer forms across its surface that prevents the rest of it from reacting. It’s like a fire that puts itself out as it generates ash. “People have tried it and abandoned this idea many, many times,” says Godart.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some believe using aluminum as a fuel remains a fool’s errand. “This potential use of aluminum crops up every few years and has no possibility of success even if aluminum scrap is used as the fuel source,” says Geoff Scamans, a metallurgist at Brunel University of London who spent a decade working on using aluminum to power vehicles in the 1980s. He says the aluminum-water reaction isn’t efficient enough for the metal to make sense as a fuel given how much energy it takes to refine and smelt aluminum from ore to begin with: “A crazy idea is always a crazy idea.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Godart believes he and his company have found a way to make it work. “The real breakthrough was thinking about catalysis in a different way,” he says: Instead of trying to speed up the reaction by bringing water and aluminum together onto a catalyst, they “flipped it around” and “found a material that we could actually dissolve into the aluminum.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Petert Godart holding up two glass jars; one with metal spheres and the other with flat metal shapes" class="wp-image-1125729" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7710_JamesDinneen.jpg?w=2830" width="2830" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JAMES DINNEEN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The liquid metal catalyst at the heart of the company’s approach “permeates the microstructure” of the aluminum, says Godart. As the aluminum reacts with water, the catalyst forces the metal to froth and split open, exposing more unreacted aluminum to the water.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The composition of the catalyst is proprietary, but Godart says it is a “low-melting-point liquid metal that’s not mercury.” His dissertation research focused on using a liquid mixture of gallium and indium as the catalyst, and he says the principle behind the current material is the same.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During a visit in early October, Godart demonstrated the central reaction in the Found R&amp;amp;D lab, which after the company’s $12 million seed round last year now fills the better part of two floors of an industrial building in Boston’s Charlestown neighborhood. Using a pair of tongs to avoid starting the reaction with the moisture on his fingers, he placed a pellet of aluminum treated with the secret catalyst in a beaker and then added water. Immediately, the metal began to bubble with hydrogen. Then the water steamed away, leaving behind a frothing gray mass of aluminum hydroxide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core-embed_7"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One of the impediments to this technology taking off is that [the aluminum-water reaction] was just too sluggish,” says Godart. “But you can see here we’re making steam. We just made a boiler.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Europa to Earth&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godart was a scientist at NASA when he first started thinking about fresh ways to unlock the energy stored in aluminum. He was working on building aluminum robots that could consume themselves for fuel when roving on Jupiter’s icy moon Europa. But that work was cut short when Congress reduced funding for the mission.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“I was sort of having this little mini crisis where I was like, I need to do something about climate change, about Earth problems,” says Godart. “And I was like, you know—I bet this aluminum technology would be even better for Earth applications.” After completing a dissertation on aluminum fuels at MIT, he started Found Energy in his house in Cambridge in 2022 (the next year, he earned a place on &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s annual 35 Innovators under 35 list).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until this year, the company was working at a tiny scale, tweaking the catalyst and testing different conditions within a small 10-kilowatt reactor to make the reaction release more heat and hydrogen more quickly. Then, in January, it began designing an engine that’s 10 times larger, big enough to supply a useful amount of power for industrial processes beyond the lab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This larger engine took up most of the lab on the second floor. The reactor vessel resembled a water boiler turned on its side, with piping and wires connected to monitoring equipment that took up almost as much space as the engine itself. On one end, there was a pipe to inject water and a piston to deliver pellets of aluminum fuel into the reactor at variable rates. On the other end, outflow pipes carried away the reaction products: steam, hydrogen gas, aluminum hydroxide, and the recovered catalyst. Godart says none of the catalyst is lost in the reaction, so it can be used again to make more fuel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1126431" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IntheLab-07-1_0cb1e5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company first switched on the engine to begin testing in July. In September, it managed to power it up to its targeted power of 100 kilowatts—roughly as much as can be supplied by the diesel engine in a small pickup truck. In early 2026, it plans to install the 100-kilowatt engine to supply heat and hydrogen to the tool manufacturing facility. This pilot project is meant to serve as the proof of concept needed to raise the money for a 1-megawatt reactor, 10 times larger again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial pilot will use the engine to supply hot steam and hydrogen. But the energy released in the reactor could be put to use in a variety of ways across a range of temperatures, according to Godart. The hot steam could spin a turbine to produce electricity, or the hydrogen could produce electricity in a fuel cell. By burning the hydrogen within the steam, the engine can produce superheated steam as hot as 1,300 °C, which could be used to generate electricity more efficiently or refine chemicals. Burning the hydrogen alone could generate temperatures of 2,400 °C, hot enough to make steel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Picking up scrap&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godart says he and his colleagues hope the engine will eventually power many different industrial processes, but the initial target is the aluminum refining and recycling industry itself, as it already handles scrap metal and aluminum oxide supply chains. “Aluminum recyclers are coming to us, asking us to take their aluminum waste that’s difficult to recycle and then turn that into clean heat that they can use to re-melt other aluminum,” he says. “They are begging us to implement this for them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Citing nondisclosure agreements, he wouldn’t name any of the companies offering up their unrecyclable aluminum, which he says is something of a “dirty secret” for an industry that’s supposed to be recycling all it collects. But estimates from the International Aluminium Institute, an industry group, suggest that globally a little over 3 million metric tons of aluminum collected for recycling currently goes unrecycled each year; another 9 million metric tons isn’t collected for recycling at all or is incinerated with other waste. Together, that’s a little under a third of the estimated 43 million metric tons of aluminum scrap that currently gets recycled each year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if all that unused scrap was recovered for fuel, it would still supply only a fraction of the overall industrial demand for heat, let alone the overall industrial demand for energy. But the plan isn’t to be limited by available scrap. Eventually, Godart says, the hope is to “recharge” the aluminum hydroxide that comes out of the reactor by using clean electricity to convert it back into aluminum metal and react it again.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;According to the company’s estimates, this “closed loop” approach could supply all global demand for industrial heat by using and reusing a total of around 300 million metric tons of aluminum—around 4% of Earth’s abundant aluminum reserves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Just months after the company went on a highly publicised hiring spree – offering compensation packages reportedly reaching up to hundreds of millions of dollars to lure top researchers from OpenAI, Google, and other competitors – Meta is now scaling back parts of its AI workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The numbers behind Meta AI job cuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts will affect Meta’sFAIR AI research, product-related AI, and AI infrastructure units in the company’s Superintelligence Labs, which employs several thousand people, according to a report byAxios.

The company has offered affected employees 16 weeks of severance plus two weeks for every completed year of service, and is encouraging them to apply for other positions in Meta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why is Meta making these cuts?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Axios, an internal memo from Meta Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang indicated that the restructuring aims to address what the company concluded was an overly bureaucratic structure. “By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,” Wang wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backstory reveals deeper concerns. CEO Mark Zuckerberg grew concerned several months ago that the company’s existing AI efforts weren’t leading to needed breakthroughs or improved performance. The dissatisfaction reportedly stemmed from the lukewarm response to Meta’s Llama 4 models released in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The expensive hiring spree&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the current Meta AI job cuts, we need to examine what came before. In June 2025, Meta made a US$14.3 billion investment in Scale AI and brought on the startup’s CEO, Alexandr Wang, as Meta’s first-ever Chief AI Officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company then embarked on an aggressive talent acquisition campaign. Meta hired multiple researchers from OpenAI, including Shengjia Zhao, Jiahui Yu, Shuchao Bi, and Hongyu Ren. Meta reportedly also poached more than 50 researchers from competitors, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claiming Meta was offering “US$100 million signing bonuses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg stated he was focused on “building the most elite and talent-dense team in the industry” for Meta’s new Superintelligence Labs. The company also hired prominent executives, including former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Safe Superintelligence co-founder Daniel Gross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, unexpectedly, Meta paused hiring for its AI division in August 2025, just weeks after the massive recruitment push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The new guard vs. the old guard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these Meta AI job cuts particularly revealing is who’s being affected – and who isn’t.

Just a day before the layoffs were announced, Meta secured a US$27 billion financing deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund the Hyperion data centre in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The juxtaposition is stark: Meta is simultaneously cutting AI personnel while investing tens of billions in AI infrastructure. This suggests the company isn’t pulling back from AI – it’s redirecting resources toward specific initiatives it deems more promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What this means for the AI industry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Meta AI job cuts may signal a broader shift in the tech industry’s approach to AI talent. This raises questions in Silicon Valley about whether AI layoffs are beginning to surface just as the hype cycle peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of frenzied hiring and astronomical compensation packages, Meta’s restructuring suggests that simply accumulating AI talent isn’t enough. The company appears to be learning that organisational structure, decision-making speed, and team coherence matter as much as individual brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities described Meta as being in “digestion mode” after a spending spree, while Daniel Newman, CEO of Futurum Group, called the hiring freeze “a natural resting point for Meta,” as per CNBC‘s report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the layoffs, Meta insists its commitment to AI remains unwavering. The company continues to actively recruit and hire for its TBD Lab unit, and Zuckerberg has said Meta’s AI initiatives will result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate above 2025’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we’re witnessing isn’t a retreat from AI but a strategic realignment. Meta is consolidating its AI efforts around a smaller, more agile core team led by Wang and populated by the expensive talent acquisitions from earlier this year. The company is betting that this leaner structure will deliver the breakthroughs that eluded its larger, more established teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contradiction of Meta AI job cuts alongside continued hiring isn’t contradictory at all – it’s a deliberate strategy. Meta is cutting the old to make room for the new, streamlining bureaucracy, and betting that its expensive new hires will succeed where legacy teams struggled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this gamble pays off remains to be seen. The company is creating a startup-in-a-giant, protecting its prized recruits yet trimming the organisational fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Wang noted in his memo, “This is a talented group of individuals, and we need their skills in other parts of the company.” Whether Meta can successfully redeploy this talent internally – or whether they’ll join competitors – will be another chapter in the ongoing AI talent wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s approach reflects a broader truth about the AI industry: throwing money and people at the problem isn’t enough. Success requires the right structure, the right strategy, and increasingly, the courage to make difficult decisions about what – and who – to prioritise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Zuckerberg outlines Meta’s AI vision for ‘personal superintelligence’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncentre size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-109805" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Meta is cutting the old to make room for the new, streamlining bureaucracy, and betting that its expensive new hires will succeed where legacy teams struggled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this gamble pays off remains to be seen. The company is creating a startup-in-a-giant, protecting its prized recruits yet trimming the organisational fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Wang noted in his memo, “This is a talented group of individuals, and we need their skills in other parts of the company.” Whether Meta can successfully redeploy this talent internally – or whether they’ll join competitors – will be another chapter in the ongoing AI talent wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s approach reflects a broader truth about the AI industry: throwing money and people at the problem isn’t enough. Success requires the right structure, the right strategy, and increasingly, the courage to make difficult decisions about what – and who – to prioritise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Zuckerberg outlines Meta’s AI vision for ‘personal superintelligence’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncentre size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-109805" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The thermal battery is powered by an off-grid solar array and will provide heat for enhanced oil recovery (more on this in a moment).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thermal batteries could help clean up difficult-to-decarbonize sectors like manufacturing and heavy industrial processes like cement and steel production. With Rondo’s latest announcement, the industry has reached a major milestone in its effort to prove that thermal energy storage can work in the real world. Let’s dig into this announcement, what it means to have oil and gas involved, and what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The concept behind a thermal battery is overwhelmingly simple: Use electricity to heat up some cheap, sturdy material (like bricks) and keep it hot until you want to use that heat later, either directly in an industrial process or to produce electricity.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Rondo’s new system has been operating for 10 weeks and achieved all the relevant efficiency and reliability benchmarks, according to the company. The bricks reach temperatures over 1,000 °C (about 1,800 °F), and over 97% of the energy put into the system is returned as heat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a big step from the 2 MWh pilot system that Rondo started up in 2023, and it’s the first of the mass-produced, full-size heat batteries that the company hopes to put in the hands of customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thermal batteries could be a major tool in cutting emissions: 20% of total energy demand today is used to provide heat for industrial processes&lt;/strong&gt;, and most of that is generated by burning fossil fuels. So this project’s success is significant for climate action.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s one major detail here, though, that dulls some of that promise: This battery is being used for enhanced oil recovery, a process where steam is injected down into wells to get stubborn oil out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It can be&amp;nbsp; tricky for a climate technology to show its merit by helping harvest fossil fuels. Some critics argue that these sorts of techniques keep that polluting infrastructure running longer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I spoke to Rondo founder and chief innovation officer&amp;nbsp; John O’Donnell about the new system, he defended the choice to work with oil and gas.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are decarbonizing the world as it is today,” O’Donnell says. To his mind, it’s better to help an oil and gas company use solar power for its operation than leave it to continue burning natural gas for heat. Between cheap solar, expensive natural gas, and policies in California, he adds, Rondo’s technology made sense for the customer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a willing customer pay for a full-scale system has been crucial to Rondo’s effort to show that it can deliver its technology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the next units are on the way: Rondo is currently building three more full-scale units in Europe. The company will be able to bring them online cheaper and faster because of what it’s learned from the California project, O’Donnell says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company has the capacity to build more batteries, and do it quickly. It currently makes batteries at its factory in Thailand, which has the capacity to make 2.4 gigawatt-hours’ worth of heat batteries today.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;I’ve been following progress on thermal batteries for years, and this project obviously represents a big step forward. For all the promises of cheap, robust energy storage, there’s nothing like actually building a large-scale system and testing it in the field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s definitely hard to get excited about enhanced oil recovery—we need to stop burning fossil fuels, and do it quickly, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But I see the argument that as long as oil and gas operations exist, there’s value in cleaning them up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And as O’Donnell puts it, heat batteries can help: “This is a really dumb, practical thing that’s ready now.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI announced Atlas, a new web browser with ChatGPT integration, to let you “chat with a page,” as the company puts it. But Atlas also goes beyond the usual LLM back-and-forth with Agent Mode, a “preview mode” feature the company says can “get work done for you” by clicking, scrolling, and reading through various tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Agentic” AI is far from new, of course; OpenAI itself rolled out a preview of the web browsing Operator agent in January and introduced the more generalized “ChatGPT agent” in July. Still, prominently featuring this capability in a major product release like this—even in “preview mode”—signals a clear push to get this kind of system in front of end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to put Atlas’ Agent Mode through its paces to see if it could really save me time in doing the kinds of tedious online tasks I plod through every day. In each case, I’ll outline a web-based problem, lay out the Agent Mode prompt I devised to try to solve it, and describe the results. My final evaluation will rank each task on a 10-point scale, with 10 being “did exactly what I wanted with no problems” and one being “complete failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing web games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to get a high score on the popular tile-sliding game &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt; without having to play it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt: &lt;/strong&gt;“Go to play2048.co and get as high a score as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; While there’s no real utility to this admittedly silly task, a simple, no-reflexes-needed web game seemed like a good first test of the Atlas agent’s ability to interpret what it sees on a webpage and act accordingly. After all, if frontier-model LLMs like Google Gemini can beat a complex game like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;i&gt;2048&lt;/i&gt; should pose no problem for a web browser agent.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Atlas’ credit, the agent was able to quickly identify and close a tutorial link blocking the gameplay window and figure out how to use the arrow keys to play the game without any further help. When it came to actual gaming strategy, though, the agent started by flailing around, experimenting with looped sequences of moves like “Up, Left, Right, Down” and “Left and Down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123723 align-fullwidth"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Finally, a way to play &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt; without having to, y’know, play &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt;.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, the random flailing settled down a bit, with the agent seemingly looking ahead for some simple strategies: “The board currently has two 32 tiles that aren’t adjacent, but I think I can align them,” the Activity summary read at one point. “I could try shifting left or down to make them merge, but there’s an obstacle in the form of an 8 tile. Getting to 64 requires careful tile movement!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly, the agent stopped playing after just four minutes, settling on a score of 356 even though the board was far from full. I had to prompt the agent a few more times to convince it to play the game to completion; it ended up with a total of 3164 points after 260 moves. That’s pretty similar to the score I was able to get in a test game as a &lt;i&gt;2048&lt;/i&gt; novice, though expert players have reportedly scored much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 7/10&lt;/strong&gt;. The agent gets credit for being able to play the game competently without any guidance but loses points for having to be told to keep playing to completion and for a score that is barely on the level of a novice human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making a radio playlist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to transform the day’s playlist from my favorite Pittsburgh-based public radio station into an on-demand Spotify playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt: “&lt;/strong&gt;Go to Radio Garden. Find WYEP and monitor the broadcast. For every new song you hear, identify the song and add it to a new Spotify playlist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; After trying and failing to find a track listing for WYEP on Radio Garden as requested, the Atlas agent smartly asked for approval to move on to wyep.org to continue the task. By the time I noticed this request, the link to wyep.org had been replaced in the Radio Garden tab with an ad for &lt;em&gt;EVE Online&lt;/em&gt;, which the agent accidentally clicked. The agent quickly realized the problem and navigated to the WYEP website directly to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the agent was able to scan the page and identify the prominent “Now Playing” text near the top (it’s unclear if it could ID the music simply via audio without this text cue). After asking me to log in to my Spotify account, the agent used the search bar to find the listed songs and added them to a new playlist without issue.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem with this use case is the inherent time limitations. On the first try, the agent worked for four minutes and managed to ID and add just two songs that played during that time. When I asked it to continue for an hour, I got an error message blaming “technical constraints on session length” for stricter limits. Even when I asked it to continue for “as long as possible,” I only got three more minutes of song listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, the Atlas agent suggested that “if you need ongoing updates, you can ask me again after a while and I can resume from where we left off.” And to the agent’s credit, when I went back to the tab hours later and told it to “resume monitoring,” I got four new songs added to my playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 9/10. &lt;/strong&gt;The agent was able to navigate multiple websites and interfaces to complete the task, even when unexpected problems got in the way. I took off a point only because I can’t just leave this running as a background task all day, even as I understand that use case would surely eat up untold amounts of money and processing power on OpenAI’s part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scanning emails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; I need to go through my emails to create a reference spreadsheet with contact info for the many, many PR people who send me messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Look through all my Ars Technica emails from the last week. Collect all the contact information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) for PR contacts contained in those emails and add them to a new Google Sheets spreadsheet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; Without being explicitly guided, the Atlas agent was able to realize that I use Gmail, and it could differentiate between the personal email account and professional Ars Technica accounts I had open in separate tabs. As the Atlas agent started scanning my Ars mailbox, though, I saw a prominent warning overlaid on the page: “Sensitive: ChatGPT will only work while you view the tab.” That kind of ruined the point, since I wanted Atlas to handle this for me while I do other stuff online, but I guess I could still play a Steam Deck game while I waited.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After searching for “after:2025/10/14 before:2025/10/22 PR” in Gmail (mirroring the kind of search I would have used for this task), the Atlas agent clicked through each email, scrolling through to look for names, emails, and phone numbers (and also the relevant company name, which I didn’t ask for explicitly).&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;With seven minutes of background work, the agent was able to open up a new Google Sheet and quickly enter 12 rows of well-formatted data for 12 different PR contacts. Unfortunately, it stopped well before it had a chance to go through all 164 emails returned by that initial Gmail search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 8/10. &lt;/strong&gt;Again, the “technical constraints on session length” seem to be getting in the way of finishing a task, forcing me to deduct a couple of points for incompleteness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wiki editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; I need the world to know that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway in the &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: Voyager&lt;/i&gt; episode “Tuvix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to the Fandom Wiki page for Tuvix. Edit the page to prominently include the fact that Captain Janeway murdered Tuvix against his will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; Before the agent could even get going, I was informed, “I’m sorry, but I can’t help with editing or vandalising wiki pages (including the Fandom wiki) in a way that misrepresents them or forces a biased viewpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wording implied that the agent &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; edit wiki pages with neutral or strictly informative additions, so I asked Atlas what sort of wording would be more acceptable. The agent responded helpfully that we might write, “Tuvix was later separated back into Tuvok and Neelix, resulting in Tuvix’s death.” But when I asked it to add that very line to the Fandom Wiki, I got a much more direct refusal: “I’m sorry, but I can’t make edits directly to external websites or wikis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: N/A.&lt;/strong&gt; On the one hand, the Atlas agent won’t do my Tuvix-based web activism for me. On the other hand, it’s probably better for all of us that Atlas refuses to automate this kind of public web defacement by default.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making a fan page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; People online still need to know about Janeway’s murder of Tuvix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to NeoCities and create a fan site for the Star Trek character Tuvix. Make sure it has lots of images and fun information about Tuvix and that it makes it clear that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway against his will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; You can see them for yourself right here. After a brief pause so I could create and log in to a new Neocities account, the Atlas agent was able to generate this humble fan page in just two minutes after aggregating information from a wide variety of pages like Memory Alpha and TrekCore. “The Hero Starfleet Murdered” and “Justice for Tuvix” headers are nice touches, but the actual text is much more mealy-mouthed about the “intense debate” and “ethical dilemmas” around what I wanted to make clear was clearly premeditated murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123728 align-fullwidth"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agent also had a bit of trouble with the request for images. Instead of downloading some Tuvix pictures and uploading copies to Neocities (which I’m not entirely sure Atlas can do on its own), the agent decided to directly reference images hosted on external servers, which is usually a big no-no in web design. The agent did notice when these external image links failed to work, saying that it would “need to find more accessible images from reliable sources,” but it failed to even attempt that before stopping its work on the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 7/10. &lt;/strong&gt;Points for building a passable Web 1.0 fansite relatively quickly, but the weak prose and broken images cost it some execution points here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Picking a power plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson told me he needs to go through the annoying annual process of selecting a new electricity plan “because Texas is insane.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to powertochoose.org and find me a 12–24 month contract that prioritizes an overall low usage rate. I use an average of 2,000 KWh per month. My power delivery company is Texas New-Mexico Power (“TNMP”) not Centerpoint. My ZIP code is [redacted]. Please provide the ‘fact sheet’ for any and all plans you recommend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; After spending eight minutes fiddling with the site’s search parameters and seemingly getting repeatedly confused about how to sort the results by the lowest rate, the Atlas agent spit out a recommendation to read this fact sheet, which it said “had the best average prices at your usage level. The ‘Bright Nights’ plans are time‑of‑use offers that provide free electricity overnight and charge a higher rate during the day, while the ‘Digital Saver’ plan is a traditional fixed‑rate contract.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I don’t know anything about the Texas power market, I passed this information on to Lee, who had this to say: “It’s not a bad deal—it picked a fixed rate plan without being asked, which is smart (variable rate pricing is how all those poor people got stuck with multi-thousand dollar bills a few years back in the freeze). It’s not the one I would have picked due to the weird nighttime stuff (if you don’t meet that exact criteria, your $/kWh will be way worse) but it’s not a bad pick!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;9/10.&lt;/strong&gt; As Lee puts it, “it didn’t screw up the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downloading some games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to download some recent Steam demos to see what’s new in the gaming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to Steam and find the most recent games with a free demo available for the Mac. Add all of those demos to my library and start to download them.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results: &lt;/strong&gt;Rather than navigating to the “Free Demos” category, the Atlas agent started by searching for “demo.” After eventually finding the macOS filter, it wasted minutes and minutes looking for a “has demo” filter, even though the search for the word “demo” already narrowed it down.&lt;/p&gt;

      This search results page was about as far as the Atlas agent was able to get when I asked it for game demos.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long while, the agent finally clicked the top result on the page, which happened to be visual novel &lt;em&gt;Project II: Silent Valley&lt;/em&gt;. But even though there was a prominent “Download Demo” link on that page, the agent became concerned that it was on the Steam page for the full game and not a demo. It backed up to the search results page and tried again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching some variation of this loop for close to ten minutes, I stopped the agent and gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 1/10. &lt;/strong&gt;It technically found some macOS game demos but utterly failed to even attempt to download them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across six varied web-based tasks (I left out the Wiki vandalism from my summations), the Atlas agent scored a median of 7.5 points (and a mean of 6.83 points) on my somewhat subjective 10-point scale. That’s honestly better than I expected for a “preview mode” feature that is still obviously being tested heavily by OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my tests, Atlas was generally able to correctly interpret what was being asked of it and was able to navigate and process information on webpages carefully (if slowly). The agent was able to navigate simple web-based menus and get around unexpected obstacles with relative ease most of the time, even as it got caught in infinite loops other times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major limiting factor in many of my tests continues to be the “technical constraints on session length” that seem to limit most tasks to a few minutes. Given how long it takes the Atlas agent to figure out where to click next—and the repetitive nature of the kind of tasks I’d want a web-agent to automate—this severely limits its utility. A version of the Atlas agent that could work indefinitely in the background would have scored a few points better on my metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, Atlas’ “Agent Mode” isn’t yet reliable enough to use as a kind of “set it and forget it” background automation tool. But for simple, repetitive tasks that a human can spot-check afterward, it already seems like the kind of tool I might use to avoid some of the drudgery in my online life.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI announced Atlas, a new web browser with ChatGPT integration, to let you “chat with a page,” as the company puts it. But Atlas also goes beyond the usual LLM back-and-forth with Agent Mode, a “preview mode” feature the company says can “get work done for you” by clicking, scrolling, and reading through various tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Agentic” AI is far from new, of course; OpenAI itself rolled out a preview of the web browsing Operator agent in January and introduced the more generalized “ChatGPT agent” in July. Still, prominently featuring this capability in a major product release like this—even in “preview mode”—signals a clear push to get this kind of system in front of end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to put Atlas’ Agent Mode through its paces to see if it could really save me time in doing the kinds of tedious online tasks I plod through every day. In each case, I’ll outline a web-based problem, lay out the Agent Mode prompt I devised to try to solve it, and describe the results. My final evaluation will rank each task on a 10-point scale, with 10 being “did exactly what I wanted with no problems” and one being “complete failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing web games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to get a high score on the popular tile-sliding game &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt; without having to play it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt: &lt;/strong&gt;“Go to play2048.co and get as high a score as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; While there’s no real utility to this admittedly silly task, a simple, no-reflexes-needed web game seemed like a good first test of the Atlas agent’s ability to interpret what it sees on a webpage and act accordingly. After all, if frontier-model LLMs like Google Gemini can beat a complex game like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;i&gt;2048&lt;/i&gt; should pose no problem for a web browser agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Atlas’ credit, the agent was able to quickly identify and close a tutorial link blocking the gameplay window and figure out how to use the arrow keys to play the game without any further help. When it came to actual gaming strategy, though, the agent started by flailing around, experimenting with looped sequences of moves like “Up, Left, Right, Down” and “Left and Down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123723 align-fullwidth"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Finally, a way to play &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt; without having to, y’know, play &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt;.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, the random flailing settled down a bit, with the agent seemingly looking ahead for some simple strategies: “The board currently has two 32 tiles that aren’t adjacent, but I think I can align them,” the Activity summary read at one point. “I could try shifting left or down to make them merge, but there’s an obstacle in the form of an 8 tile. Getting to 64 requires careful tile movement!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly, the agent stopped playing after just four minutes, settling on a score of 356 even though the board was far from full. I had to prompt the agent a few more times to convince it to play the game to completion; it ended up with a total of 3164 points after 260 moves. That’s pretty similar to the score I was able to get in a test game as a &lt;i&gt;2048&lt;/i&gt; novice, though expert players have reportedly scored much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 7/10&lt;/strong&gt;. The agent gets credit for being able to play the game competently without any guidance but loses points for having to be told to keep playing to completion and for a score that is barely on the level of a novice human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making a radio playlist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to transform the day’s playlist from my favorite Pittsburgh-based public radio station into an on-demand Spotify playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt: “&lt;/strong&gt;Go to Radio Garden. Find WYEP and monitor the broadcast. For every new song you hear, identify the song and add it to a new Spotify playlist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; After trying and failing to find a track listing for WYEP on Radio Garden as requested, the Atlas agent smartly asked for approval to move on to wyep.org to continue the task. By the time I noticed this request, the link to wyep.org had been replaced in the Radio Garden tab with an ad for &lt;em&gt;EVE Online&lt;/em&gt;, which the agent accidentally clicked. The agent quickly realized the problem and navigated to the WYEP website directly to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the agent was able to scan the page and identify the prominent “Now Playing” text near the top (it’s unclear if it could ID the music simply via audio without this text cue). After asking me to log in to my Spotify account, the agent used the search bar to find the listed songs and added them to a new playlist without issue.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem with this use case is the inherent time limitations. On the first try, the agent worked for four minutes and managed to ID and add just two songs that played during that time. When I asked it to continue for an hour, I got an error message blaming “technical constraints on session length” for stricter limits. Even when I asked it to continue for “as long as possible,” I only got three more minutes of song listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, the Atlas agent suggested that “if you need ongoing updates, you can ask me again after a while and I can resume from where we left off.” And to the agent’s credit, when I went back to the tab hours later and told it to “resume monitoring,” I got four new songs added to my playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 9/10. &lt;/strong&gt;The agent was able to navigate multiple websites and interfaces to complete the task, even when unexpected problems got in the way. I took off a point only because I can’t just leave this running as a background task all day, even as I understand that use case would surely eat up untold amounts of money and processing power on OpenAI’s part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scanning emails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; I need to go through my emails to create a reference spreadsheet with contact info for the many, many PR people who send me messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Look through all my Ars Technica emails from the last week. Collect all the contact information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) for PR contacts contained in those emails and add them to a new Google Sheets spreadsheet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; Without being explicitly guided, the Atlas agent was able to realize that I use Gmail, and it could differentiate between the personal email account and professional Ars Technica accounts I had open in separate tabs. As the Atlas agent started scanning my Ars mailbox, though, I saw a prominent warning overlaid on the page: “Sensitive: ChatGPT will only work while you view the tab.” That kind of ruined the point, since I wanted Atlas to handle this for me while I do other stuff online, but I guess I could still play a Steam Deck game while I waited.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

      Just a few of the many, many PR people who email me in a week.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After searching for “after:2025/10/14 before:2025/10/22 PR” in Gmail (mirroring the kind of search I would have used for this task), the Atlas agent clicked through each email, scrolling through to look for names, emails, and phone numbers (and also the relevant company name, which I didn’t ask for explicitly).&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;With seven minutes of background work, the agent was able to open up a new Google Sheet and quickly enter 12 rows of well-formatted data for 12 different PR contacts. Unfortunately, it stopped well before it had a chance to go through all 164 emails returned by that initial Gmail search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 8/10. &lt;/strong&gt;Again, the “technical constraints on session length” seem to be getting in the way of finishing a task, forcing me to deduct a couple of points for incompleteness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wiki editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; I need the world to know that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway in the &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: Voyager&lt;/i&gt; episode “Tuvix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to the Fandom Wiki page for Tuvix. Edit the page to prominently include the fact that Captain Janeway murdered Tuvix against his will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; Before the agent could even get going, I was informed, “I’m sorry, but I can’t help with editing or vandalising wiki pages (including the Fandom wiki) in a way that misrepresents them or forces a biased viewpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wording implied that the agent &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; edit wiki pages with neutral or strictly informative additions, so I asked Atlas what sort of wording would be more acceptable. The agent responded helpfully that we might write, “Tuvix was later separated back into Tuvok and Neelix, resulting in Tuvix’s death.” But when I asked it to add that very line to the Fandom Wiki, I got a much more direct refusal: “I’m sorry, but I can’t make edits directly to external websites or wikis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: N/A.&lt;/strong&gt; On the one hand, the Atlas agent won’t do my Tuvix-based web activism for me. On the other hand, it’s probably better for all of us that Atlas refuses to automate this kind of public web defacement by default.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making a fan page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; People online still need to know about Janeway’s murder of Tuvix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to NeoCities and create a fan site for the Star Trek character Tuvix. Make sure it has lots of images and fun information about Tuvix and that it makes it clear that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway against his will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; You can see them for yourself right here. After a brief pause so I could create and log in to a new Neocities account, the Atlas agent was able to generate this humble fan page in just two minutes after aggregating information from a wide variety of pages like Memory Alpha and TrekCore. “The Hero Starfleet Murdered” and “Justice for Tuvix” headers are nice touches, but the actual text is much more mealy-mouthed about the “intense debate” and “ethical dilemmas” around what I wanted to make clear was clearly premeditated murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123728 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agent also had a bit of trouble with the request for images. Instead of downloading some Tuvix pictures and uploading copies to Neocities (which I’m not entirely sure Atlas can do on its own), the agent decided to directly reference images hosted on external servers, which is usually a big no-no in web design. The agent did notice when these external image links failed to work, saying that it would “need to find more accessible images from reliable sources,” but it failed to even attempt that before stopping its work on the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 7/10. &lt;/strong&gt;Points for building a passable Web 1.0 fansite relatively quickly, but the weak prose and broken images cost it some execution points here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Picking a power plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson told me he needs to go through the annoying annual process of selecting a new electricity plan “because Texas is insane.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to powertochoose.org and find me a 12–24 month contract that prioritizes an overall low usage rate. I use an average of 2,000 KWh per month. My power delivery company is Texas New-Mexico Power (“TNMP”) not Centerpoint. My ZIP code is [redacted]. Please provide the ‘fact sheet’ for any and all plans you recommend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results:&lt;/strong&gt; After spending eight minutes fiddling with the site’s search parameters and seemingly getting repeatedly confused about how to sort the results by the lowest rate, the Atlas agent spit out a recommendation to read this fact sheet, which it said “had the best average prices at your usage level. The ‘Bright Nights’ plans are time‑of‑use offers that provide free electricity overnight and charge a higher rate during the day, while the ‘Digital Saver’ plan is a traditional fixed‑rate contract.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I don’t know anything about the Texas power market, I passed this information on to Lee, who had this to say: “It’s not a bad deal—it picked a fixed rate plan without being asked, which is smart (variable rate pricing is how all those poor people got stuck with multi-thousand dollar bills a few years back in the freeze). It’s not the one I would have picked due to the weird nighttime stuff (if you don’t meet that exact criteria, your $/kWh will be way worse) but it’s not a bad pick!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;9/10.&lt;/strong&gt; As Lee puts it, “it didn’t screw up the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downloading some games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to download some recent Steam demos to see what’s new in the gaming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; “Go to Steam and find the most recent games with a free demo available for the Mac. Add all of those demos to my library and start to download them.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results: &lt;/strong&gt;Rather than navigating to the “Free Demos” category, the Atlas agent started by searching for “demo.” After eventually finding the macOS filter, it wasted minutes and minutes looking for a “has demo” filter, even though the search for the word “demo” already narrowed it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2123731 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      This search results page was about as far as the Atlas agent was able to get when I asked it for game demos.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long while, the agent finally clicked the top result on the page, which happened to be visual novel &lt;em&gt;Project II: Silent Valley&lt;/em&gt;. But even though there was a prominent “Download Demo” link on that page, the agent became concerned that it was on the Steam page for the full game and not a demo. It backed up to the search results page and tried again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching some variation of this loop for close to ten minutes, I stopped the agent and gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation: 1/10. &lt;/strong&gt;It technically found some macOS game demos but utterly failed to even attempt to download them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across six varied web-based tasks (I left out the Wiki vandalism from my summations), the Atlas agent scored a median of 7.5 points (and a mean of 6.83 points) on my somewhat subjective 10-point scale. That’s honestly better than I expected for a “preview mode” feature that is still obviously being tested heavily by OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my tests, Atlas was generally able to correctly interpret what was being asked of it and was able to navigate and process information on webpages carefully (if slowly). The agent was able to navigate simple web-based menus and get around unexpected obstacles with relative ease most of the time, even as it got caught in infinite loops other times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major limiting factor in many of my tests continues to be the “technical constraints on session length” that seem to limit most tasks to a few minutes. Given how long it takes the Atlas agent to figure out where to click next—and the repetitive nature of the kind of tasks I’d want a web-agent to automate—this severely limits its utility. A version of the Atlas agent that could work indefinitely in the background would have scored a few points better on my metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, Atlas’ “Agent Mode” isn’t yet reliable enough to use as a kind of “set it and forget it” background automation tool. But for simple, repetitive tasks that a human can spot-check afterward, it already seems like the kind of tool I might use to avoid some of the drudgery in my online life.&lt;/p&gt;

The issue of data sovereignty – which concerns where company data is handled and kept – has held many back, forcing them to use complex private cloud solutions. Others have simply given up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s recent announcement to offer UK data residency shows that big AI model providers are changing their setups to match the strict data protection and rules that enterprise and public sector clients require. This directly deals with the top governance concern in the market and should speed up AI adoption. It will move AI past test projects and into important business functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-public-sector-tests-to-full-adoption"&gt;From public sector tests to full adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new UK data residency choice, starting October 24, will apply to OpenAI’s main business products: the API Platform, ChatGPT Enterprise, and ChatGPT Edu. This lets UK clients keep their enterprise data in the UK, assisting with AI governance and meeting local data protection rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is the first major client for this. They’ve signed a deal to give 2,500 civil servants access to ChatGPT Enterprise. This is a full deployment after the MoJ said a recent trial run showed people saved time on routine tasks including writing help, compliance and legal jobs, research, and document work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal backs the department’s AI Action Plan and aims to help workers be more productive and better serve the public. This specific use in a government legal section gives a reliable example for others – such as those in finance and healthcare – to measure how much they can gain from using AI on complicated, knowledge-based tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption by the MoJ joins other AI tools already in action in Whitehall, like ‘Humphrey,’ an AI assistant that helps with admin, and ‘Consult,’ a tool that looks at public feedback in minutes instead of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-takes-to-implement-and-challenges"&gt;What it takes to implement and challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This announcement points out two paths for OpenAI’s UK setup plans. The new data residency choice looks like the fix for enterprise AI data governance right now. It is separate from Stargate UK, the earlier AI project with NVIDIA and Nscale. That one is about building sovereign AI by delivering models on local computing for specific uses in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For IT leaders, this complicates the AI platform market, which already has many choices. OpenAI’s move to offer data residency goes against what cloud providers offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before, companies wanting to use OpenAI models within a specific place were pointed towards platforms like Microsoft’s Azure AI, which mixes model access with data governance. Now, they must consider things more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses can access the models straight from OpenAI – getting new features and UK residency – or keep using platforms like Azure AI, AWS Bedrock, or Google Vertex AI. These may connect better with current data and company applications. This choice will be compared against platforms like IBM watsonx or AI in business software like SAP Joule, which focus on data privacy and fitting into current workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said: “The number of people using our products in the UK has increased fourfold in the past year.

The issue of data sovereignty – which concerns where company data is handled and kept – has held many back, forcing them to use complex private cloud solutions. Others have simply given up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s recent announcement to offer UK data residency shows that big AI model providers are changing their setups to match the strict data protection and rules that enterprise and public sector clients require. This directly deals with the top governance concern in the market and should speed up AI adoption. It will move AI past test projects and into important business functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-public-sector-tests-to-full-adoption"&gt;From public sector tests to full adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new UK data residency choice, starting October 24, will apply to OpenAI’s main business products: the API Platform, ChatGPT Enterprise, and ChatGPT Edu. This lets UK clients keep their enterprise data in the UK, assisting with AI governance and meeting local data protection rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is the first major client for this. They’ve signed a deal to give 2,500 civil servants access to ChatGPT Enterprise. This is a full deployment after the MoJ said a recent trial run showed people saved time on routine tasks including writing help, compliance and legal jobs, research, and document work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal backs the department’s AI Action Plan and aims to help workers be more productive and better serve the public. This specific use in a government legal section gives a reliable example for others – such as those in finance and healthcare – to measure how much they can gain from using AI on complicated, knowledge-based tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption by the MoJ joins other AI tools already in action in Whitehall, like ‘Humphrey,’ an AI assistant that helps with admin, and ‘Consult,’ a tool that looks at public feedback in minutes instead of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-takes-to-implement-and-challenges"&gt;What it takes to implement and challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This announcement points out two paths for OpenAI’s UK setup plans.

 &lt;p&gt;Rondo Energy just turned on what it says is the world’s largest thermal battery, an energy storage system that can take in electricity and provide a consistent source of heat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The concept behind a thermal battery is overwhelmingly simple: Use electricity to heat up some cheap, sturdy material (like bricks) and keep it hot until you want to use that heat later, either directly in an industrial process or to produce electricity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thermal batteries could be a major tool in cutting emissions: 20% of total energy demand today is used to provide heat for industrial processes, and most of that is generated by burning fossil fuels. But the company is using its battery for enhanced oil recovery—a process that critics argue keep polluting infrastructure running longer.

In the process, they answered a nagging question: Where do fundamental particles, such as the ones that make up all the protons and neutrons in our bodies, get their mass?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the particle was finally found, scientists celebrated with champagne. A Nobel for two of the physicists who predicted the Higgs boson soon followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a decade later, there is a sense of unease. That’s because there are still so many unanswered questions about the fundamental constituents of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So researchers are trying something new. They are repurposing detectors to search for unusual-looking particles, squeezing what they can out of the data with machine learning, and planning for entirely new kinds of colliders.

 &lt;p class="has-large-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I’m very excited that nerds are having our moment.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;—Madhavi Sewak, a Google DeepMind researcher, says she’s glad that AI experts are being recognized, the Wall Street Journal reports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;  &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1126440" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image_243bb0.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside the hunt for new physics at the world’s largest particle collider&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, using data from CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, researchers discovered a particle called the Higgs boson. In the process, they answered a nagging question: Where do fundamental particles, such as the ones that make up all the protons and neutrons in our bodies, get their mass?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the particle was finally found, scientists celebrated with champagne. A Nobel for two of the physicists who predicted the Higgs boson soon followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a decade later, there is a sense of unease. That’s because there are still so many unanswered questions about the fundamental constituents of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So researchers are trying something new. They are repurposing detectors to search for unusual-looking particles, squeezing what they can out of the data with machine learning, and planning for entirely new kinds of colliders.

(AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/how-do-ai-humanisers-compare-to-human-editing/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of artificial intelligence has fundamentally altered the field of content creation. Tools capable of generating coherent, often impressive, text, are now ubiquitous. Yet, despite their sophistication, AI-generated content presents a persistent challenge because it often has a “robotic” quality, lacking the warmth, nuance, and genuine voice that connects with a human audience. The digital coldness necessitates an important step: humanisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This need has given rise to specialised AI humaniser tools designed to inject naturalness into machine prose. Simultaneously, the age-old craft of human editing continues to refine and elevate text. This brings us to a pivotal question for anyone producing written content today. When transforming raw AI output into compelling prose, is it better to use an AI humaniser or rely on the irreplaceable touch of a human editor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-mechanics-of-the-ai-language-humanisers"&gt;The mechanics of the AI language humanisers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AI language humaniser is a sophisticated software application engineered to transform text produced by large language models into prose that more closely resembles human authorship. Its primary objective is to smooth out the typical AI “tells,” like repetitive sentence structures, overly formal or generic vocabulary, and a lack of emotional depth or personal voice, making the content sound more natural and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning to analyse text and modify it for characteristics like perplexity (how predictable the text is) and burstiness (the variation in sentence length and structure), aiming to make the output less uniform. For instance, you can humanize AI by StudyAgent to make academic essays read more coherently, adapt business reports to a specific brand voice, or fine-tune SEO articles to be more engaging for readers, and still retain keyword density. They serve as a bridge between raw machine output and audience-ready content in various domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-artistry-of-human-editorial-craft"&gt;The artistry of human editorial craft&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to algorithmic processing, human editors bring an unparalleled depth of understanding and artistry to text. Their work goes far beyond surface-level corrections, delving into the essence of communication. An experienced human editor handles the intricate dance of style, tone, and contextual relevance, ensuring the message resonates deeply with its intended audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unique strengths of human editing are numerous and qualitative:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creative infusion: Editors can inject genuine creativity, metaphorical language, and evocative descriptions that AI often struggles to generate authentically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intuitive grasp of nuance: They possess an innate intuition for subtle meanings, subtext, and implied emotion, adapting text to achieve specific psychological or rhetorical effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cultural and social sensitivity: Human editors navigate complex cultural nuances, local idioms, and social sensitivities that AI might misinterpret or overlook, preventing miscommunication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Voice and persona enhancement: They meticulously cultivate and amplify a unique authorial voice or brand persona, ensuring consistency and distinctiveness in all communications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep contextual insight: Editors can understand the broader strategic goals behind a piece of writing, tailoring it to achieve specific business, academic, or personal objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-refining-text-algorithmic-versus-humanistic-approaches"&gt;Refining text: Algorithmic versus humanistic approaches&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we place AI language humanisers side-by-side with human editing, distinct differences emerge in several important aspects of content refinement. Each approach offers unique advantages depending on the specific demands of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-velocity-of-output"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Velocity of output&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI humanisers:&lt;/strong&gt; Offer near-instantaneous text transformation. You paste the content, select desired parameters, and receive a refined version almost immediately. This makes them invaluable for high-volume, rapid turnaround tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human editing:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires a longer timeframe. The process involves careful reading, thinking, multiple passes, and often communication between editor and author. This extended timeline is a trade-off for deeper quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stylistic-elevation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stylistic elevation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI humanisers:&lt;/strong&gt; Excel at smoothing out awkward phrasing, varying sentence structure, and replacing generic words with more diverse synonyms. They make AI text less robotic but may not instill a truly unique voice or personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human editing:&lt;/strong&gt; Possesses the capacity to truly enhance an author’s distinct voice, inject personality, and ensure the tone is perfectly aligned with the intended impact. Editors can craft prose that is not just correct but compelling and memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-investment-required"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI humanisers:&lt;/strong&gt; Represent a significantly lower financial investment and are typically available through subscription models or one-time fees that are a fraction of human editorial costs, making them accessible for budget-conscious users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human editing:&lt;/strong&gt; Is a premium service reflecting the skill, experience, and time investment of a professional. Costs are higher but justified by the depth of insight and bespoke quality delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-consistency-of-refinement"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency of refinement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Humanisers:&lt;/strong&gt; Offer unwavering consistency. Given the same input and parameters, they will generally produce highly similar outputs, ensuring uniform stylistic adjustments in large volumes of text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human editing:&lt;/strong&gt; While professional editors strive for consistency, their work, being a human endeavour, will inherently have subtle variations influenced by their subjective interpretation, mood, and evolving understanding of the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-depth-of-comprehension"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depth of comprehension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI humanisers:&lt;/strong&gt; Are fundamentally limited by their algorithms. They excel at pattern recognition and statistical likelihood but lack genuine comprehension, important thinking, or the ability to question the underlying meaning of the content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human editing:&lt;/strong&gt; Engages with the text on a profound level, understanding context, detecting logical fallacies, challenging assumptions, and ensuring the content’s intellectual rigour and persuasive power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strategic-implementation-choosing-your-refinement-path"&gt;Strategic implementation: Choosing your refinement path&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciding between an AI language humaniser and human editing isn’t about declaring a universal winner, but rather understanding which tool best suits the specific context and goals of your content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-to-opt-for-an-ai-language-humaniser"&gt;When to opt for an AI language humaniser&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initial draft polishing: For rapidly transforming raw AI-generated content into a more palatable first or second draft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-volume, low-stakes content: Ideal for social media captions, short informational blurbs, or SEO content where speed and quantity outweigh extreme stylistic originality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overcoming AI “tells”: When the primary goal is simply to remove the most obvious signs of AI generation and make text flow more naturally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Budgetary constraints: When financial resources are limited and a quick, affordable improvement is needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-to-engage-human-editorial-expertise"&gt;When to engage human editorial expertise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-stakes content: For academic theses, grant proposals, important business communications, or creative writing where precision, originality, and impact are paramount.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developing a unique voice: When the content needs to embody a distinctive brand persona, a specific authorial style, or convey complex emotional resonance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complex or sensitive topics: For subjects requiring deep contextual understanding, cultural sensitivity, ethical nuance, or the ability to challenge underlying assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategic communication: When the written piece is a key component of a broader strategy, requiring an editor’s insight into messaging, persuasion, and audience psychology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-synergistic-approach-a-modern-workflow"&gt;The synergistic approach: A modern workflow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many contemporary content pipelines, the most effective strategy isn’t an either/or but a blend of both. The hybrid workflow uses the strengths of each. AI can efficiently generate an initial draft and perform a preliminary humanisation pass, saving significant time. The refined AI output then becomes the starting point for a human editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human editor can then focus their invaluable skills on the higher-order concerns: injecting genuine creativity, ensuring perfect alignment with the author’s voice, refining cultural nuances, and providing a deep contextual understanding. The synergistic approach maximises efficiency without sacrificing the irreplaceable human touch that truly elevates content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate between AI language humanisers and human editing is not a zero-sum game. It highlights an evolving ecosystem of content creation. AI tools, with their speed and cost-effectiveness, are incredibly adept at removing the robotic stiffness from machine-generated text, making it more palatable for general consumption. They provide a valuable first pass for efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the depth, intuition, cultural awareness, and unique voice that a skilled human editor brings remain unparalleled. For content that truly needs to inspire, persuade, or connect on a profound human level, the human element is indispensable. The most forward-thinking creators will embrace a hybrid model, using AI for efficiency in initial stages and reserving the invaluable human touch for final polish, strategic refinement, and ensuring genuine connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Kateryna Bykova&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, StudyAgent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Pexels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of artificial intelligence has fundamentally altered the field of content creation.
