&lt;p&gt;“Innovative algorithms can only demonstrate their true value when tested with real-world data and in actual scenarios, where they can be continuously optimized through iteration,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xu’s commitment to balancing algorithmic innovation with practical application has shaped his entire career. During his PhD studies at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Xu focused on emerging technologies like multiple kernel learning methods and multimodal machine learning. Today he’s applying these techniques to real-world use cases like image recognition and video classification.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After completing his doctorate, he joined the Institute of High Performance Computing at Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), where he worked on interdisciplinary projects ranging from medical image recognition to AI systems for detecting defects on facade of buildings. These experiences broadened his perspective and deepened his passion for translating AI into real-world impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Xu joined Microsoft Research Asia where he began a new chapter focused on bridging between academic research and real-world AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft Research Asia is committed to integrating scientific exploration with real-world applications, which creates a unique research environment,” Xu says. “It brings together top talent and resources, and Microsoft’s engineering and product ecosystem strongly supports turning research into impactful technology. The lab’s open and inclusive culture encourages innovation with broader societal impact. It reflects the approach to research I’ve always hoped to contribute to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bringing-cross-domain-expertise-to-ai-s-real-world-frontiers"&gt;Bringing cross-domain expertise to AI’s real-world frontiers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a key hub in Microsoft Research’s network across Asia, the Singapore lab is guided by a three-part mission: to drive industry-transforming AI deployment, pursue fundamental breakthroughs in the field, and promote responsible, socially beneficial applications of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To reach these goals, Xu and his colleagues are working closely with local collaborators, combining cross-disciplinary expertise to tackle complex, real-world challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xu draws on his experience in healthcare as he leads the team’s collaboration with Singapore’s SingHealth to explore how AI can support precision medicine. Their efforts focus on leveraging SingHealth’s data and expertise to develop AI capabilities aimed at delivering personalized analysis and enhanced diagnostic accuracy to enable better patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond healthcare, the team is also targeting key sectors like finance and logistics. By developing domain-specific foundation models and AI agents, they aim to support smarter decision-making and accelerate digital transformation across industries. “Singapore has a strong foundation in these sectors,” Xu notes, “making it an ideal environment for technology validation and iteration.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team is also partnering with leading academic institutions, including the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), to advance the field of spatial intelligence. Their goal is to develop embodied intelligence systems capable of carrying out complex tasks in smart environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI becomes more deeply embedded in everyday life, researchers at the Singapore lab are also increasingly focused on what they call “societal AI”—building AI systems that are culturally relevant and trustworthy within Southeast Asia’s unique cultural and social contexts. Working with global colleagues, they are helping to advance a more culturally grounded and responsible approach to AI research in the region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-research-asia-singapore-expanding-global-reach-connecting-regional-innovation"&gt;Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore: Expanding global reach, connecting regional innovation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Realizing AI’s full potential requires more than technical breakthroughs. It also depends on collaboration—across industries, academia, and policy. Only through this intersection of forces can AI move beyond the lab to deliver meaningful societal value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Singapore’s strengths in science, engineering, and digital governance make it an ideal setting for this kind of work. Its collaborative culture, robust infrastructure, international talent pool, and strong policy support for science and technology make it fertile ground for interdisciplinary research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is why Microsoft Research Asia continues to collaborate closely with Singapore’s top universities, research institutions, and industry partners. These partnerships support joint research, talent development, and technical exchange. Building on this foundation, Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore will further deepen its collaboration with NUS, NTU Singapore, and Singapore Management University (SMU) to advance both fundamental and applied research, while equipping the next generation of researchers with real-world experience. In addition, Microsoft Research Asia is fostering academic exchange and strengthening the research ecosystem through summer schools and joint workshops with NUS, NTU Singapore, and SMU.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Singapore lab further marks an important step in expanding the company’s global research footprint, serving as a bridge between regional innovation and Microsoft’s global ecosystem. Through its integrated lab network, Microsoft Research fosters the sharing of technologies, methods, and real-world insights, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We aim to build a research hub in Singapore that is globally connected and deeply rooted in the local ecosystem,” Xu says. “Many breakthroughs come from interdisciplinary and cross-regional collaboration. By breaking boundaries—across disciplines, industries, and geographies—we can drive research that has lasting impact.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI becomes more deeply woven into industry and everyday life, Xu believes that meaningful research must be closely connected to regional development and social well-being.&lt;br /&gt;“Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore is a future-facing lab,” he says. “While we push technological frontiers, we’re equally committed to the responsibility of technology—ensuring AI can help address society’s most pressing challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a world shaped by global challenges, Xu sees collaboration and innovation as essential to real progress. With Singapore as a launchpad, he and his team are working to extend AI’s impact and value across Southeast Asia and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Xingxing Xu (center) with colleagues at Microsoft Research Asia - Singapore&amp;nbsp;" class="wp-image-1145598" height="768" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Xinxing-with-colleagues.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Xingxing Xu (center) with colleagues at Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="three-essential-strengths-for-the-next-generation-of-ai-researchers"&gt;Three essential strengths for the next generation of AI researchers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI’s progress depends not only on technical breakthroughs but also on the growth and dedication of talent. At Microsoft Research Asia, there is a strong belief that bringing research into the real world requires more than technical coordination—it depends on unlocking the full creativity and potential of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Singapore—a regional innovation hub that connects Southeast Asia—Xu and his colleagues are working to push AI beyond the lab and into fields like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. For young researchers hoping to shape the future of AI, this is a uniquely powerful stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help guide the next generation, Xu shares three pieces of advice:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a strong foundation&lt;/strong&gt; – “Core knowledge in machine learning, linear algebra, and probability and statistics is the bedrock of AI research,” Xu says. “A solid theoretical base is essential to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving field. Even today’s hottest trends in generative AI rely on longstanding principles of optimization and model architecture design.” While code generation tools are on the rise, Xu emphasizes that mathematical fundamentals remain essential for understanding and innovating in AI.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand real-world applications&lt;/strong&gt; – Technical skills alone aren’t enough. Xu encourages young researchers to deeply engage with the problems they’re trying to solve. Only by tightly integrating technology with its context can researchers create truly valuable solutions.&lt;p&gt;“In healthcare, for example, researchers may need to follow doctors in clinics to gain a true understanding of clinical workflows. That context helps identify the best entry points for AI deployment. Framing research problems around real-world needs is often more impactful than just tuning model parameters,” Xu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop interdisciplinary thinking&lt;/strong&gt; – Cross-disciplinary collaboration is becoming essential to AI innovation. Xu advises young researchers to learn how to work with experts from other fields to explore new directions together. “These kinds of interactions often spark fresh, creative ideas,” he says.&lt;p&gt;Maintaining curiosity is just as important. “Being open to new technologies and fields is what enables researchers to continually break new ground and produce original results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xu extends an open invitation to aspiring researchers from all backgrounds to join Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore. “We offer a unique platform that blends cutting-edge research with real-world impact,” he says. “It’s a place where you can work on the frontiers of AI—and see how your work can help transform industries and improve lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

Using a device called a gyrotron, the company wants to drill deeper, cheaper, in an effort to unlock geothermal power anywhere on the planet. (For all the details, check it out here.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the story, I visited Quaise’s headquarters in Houston. I also took a trip across town to Nabors Industries, Quaise’s investor and tech partner and one of the biggest drilling companies in the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Standing on top of a drilling rig in the backyard of Nabors’s headquarters, I couldn’t stop thinking about the role oil and gas companies are playing in the energy transition. This industry has resources and energy expertise—but also a vested interest in fossil fuels. Can it really be part of addressing climate change?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The relationship between Quaise and Nabors is one that we see increasingly often in climate tech—a startup partnering up with an established company in a similar field. (Another one that comes to mind is in the cement industry, where Sublime Systems has seen a lot of support from legacy players including Holcim, one of the biggest cement companies in the world.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Quaise got an early investment from Nabors in 2021, to the tune of $12 million. Now the company also serves as a technical partner for the startup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We are agnostic to what hole we’re drilling,” says Cameron Maresh, a project engineer on the energy transition team at Nabors Industries. The company is working on other investments and projects in the geothermal industry, Maresh says, and the work with Quaise is the culmination of a yearslong collaboration: “We’re just truly excited to see what Quaise can do.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;From the outside, this sort of partnership makes a lot of sense for Quaise. It gets resources and expertise. Meanwhile, Nabors is getting involved with an innovative company that could represent a new direction for geothermal. And maybe more to the point, if fossil fuels are to be phased out, this deal gives the company a stake in next-generation energy production.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is so much potential for oil and gas companies to play a productive role in addressing climate change.&lt;/strong&gt; One report from the International Energy Agency examined the role these legacy players could take: &amp;nbsp;“Energy transitions can happen without the engagement of the oil and gas industry, but the journey to net zero will be more costly and difficult to navigate if they are not on board,” the authors wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the agency’s blueprint for what a net-zero emissions energy system could look like in 2050, about 30% of energy could come from sources where the oil and gas industry’s knowledge and resources are useful. That includes hydrogen, liquid biofuels, biomethane, carbon capture, and geothermal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But so far, the industry has hardly lived up to its potential as a positive force for the climate. &lt;/strong&gt;Also in that report, the IEA pointed out that oil and gas producers made up only about 1% of global investment in climate tech in 2022. Investment has ticked up a bit since then, but still, it’s tough to argue that the industry is committed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now that climate tech is falling out of fashion with the government in the US, I’d venture to guess that we’re going to see oil and gas companies increasingly pulling back on their investments and promises.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;BP recently backtracked on previous commitments to cut oil and gas production and invest in clean energy. And last year the company announced that it had written off $1.1 billion in offshore wind investments in 2023 and wanted to sell other wind assets. Shell closed down all its hydrogen fueling stations for vehicles in California last year. (This might not be all that big a loss, since EVs are beating hydrogen by a huge margin in the US, but it’s still worth noting.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So oil and gas companies are investing what amounts to pennies and often backtrack when the political winds change direction. And, let’s not forget, fossil-fuel companies have a long history of behaving badly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In perhaps the most notorious example, scientists at Exxon modeled climate change in the 1970s, and their forecasts turned out to be quite accurate. Rather than publish that research, the company downplayed how climate change might affect the planet. (For what it’s worth, company representatives have argued that this was less of a coverup and more of an internal discussion that wasn’t fit to be shared outside the company.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;While fossil fuels are still part of our near-term future, oil and gas companies, and particularly producers, would need to make drastic changes to align with climate goals—changes that wouldn’t be in their financial interest. Few seem inclined to really take the turn needed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the IEA report puts it: &amp;nbsp;“In practice, no one committed to change should wait for someone else to move first.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

Using a device called a gyrotron, the company wants to drill deeper, cheaper, in an effort to unlock geothermal power anywhere on the planet. (For all the details, check it out here.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the story, I visited Quaise’s headquarters in Houston. I also took a trip across town to Nabors Industries, Quaise’s investor and tech partner and one of the biggest drilling companies in the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Standing on top of a drilling rig in the backyard of Nabors’s headquarters, I couldn’t stop thinking about the role oil and gas companies are playing in the energy transition. This industry has resources and energy expertise—but also a vested interest in fossil fuels. Can it really be part of addressing climate change?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The relationship between Quaise and Nabors is one that we see increasingly often in climate tech—a startup partnering up with an established company in a similar field. (Another one that comes to mind is in the cement industry, where Sublime Systems has seen a lot of support from legacy players including Holcim, one of the biggest cement companies in the world.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Quaise got an early investment from Nabors in 2021, to the tune of $12 million. Now the company also serves as a technical partner for the startup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We are agnostic to what hole we’re drilling,” says Cameron Maresh, a project engineer on the energy transition team at Nabors Industries. The company is working on other investments and projects in the geothermal industry, Maresh says, and the work with Quaise is the culmination of a yearslong collaboration: “We’re just truly excited to see what Quaise can do.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;From the outside, this sort of partnership makes a lot of sense for Quaise. It gets resources and expertise. Meanwhile, Nabors is getting involved with an innovative company that could represent a new direction for geothermal. And maybe more to the point, if fossil fuels are to be phased out, this deal gives the company a stake in next-generation energy production.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is so much potential for oil and gas companies to play a productive role in addressing climate change.&lt;/strong&gt; One report from the International Energy Agency examined the role these legacy players could take: &amp;nbsp;“Energy transitions can happen without the engagement of the oil and gas industry, but the journey to net zero will be more costly and difficult to navigate if they are not on board,” the authors wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the agency’s blueprint for what a net-zero emissions energy system could look like in 2050, about 30% of energy could come from sources where the oil and gas industry’s knowledge and resources are useful. That includes hydrogen, liquid biofuels, biomethane, carbon capture, and geothermal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But so far, the industry has hardly lived up to its potential as a positive force for the climate. &lt;/strong&gt;Also in that report, the IEA pointed out that oil and gas producers made up only about 1% of global investment in climate tech in 2022. Investment has ticked up a bit since then, but still, it’s tough to argue that the industry is committed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now that climate tech is falling out of fashion with the government in the US, I’d venture to guess that we’re going to see oil and gas companies increasingly pulling back on their investments and promises.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;BP recently backtracked on previous commitments to cut oil and gas production and invest in clean energy. And last year the company announced that it had written off $1.1 billion in offshore wind investments in 2023 and wanted to sell other wind assets. Shell closed down all its hydrogen fueling stations for vehicles in California last year. (This might not be all that big a loss, since EVs are beating hydrogen by a huge margin in the US, but it’s still worth noting.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So oil and gas companies are investing what amounts to pennies and often backtrack when the political winds change direction.
