&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;UK-based Cavalry works on 2D motion animation for different verticals such as advertising, marketing, gaming, and generative art. Canva said that Cavalry’s tooling will add to the existing capabilities of Affinity, Canva’s professional creative editing suite for photos, vectors, and layouts, which it acquired in 2024&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Canva revamped Affinity’s design last year and made it free for all users. The company said that since then, people have downloaded the software over five million times. Affinity has the capabilities of photos, vector, and layout editing. With this acquisition, Canva wants to add motion editing to its suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“By bringing Cavalry alongside&amp;nbsp;Affinity, we’re closing that [motion editing] gap and unlocking a complete professional suite spanning photo, vector, layout, and now motion editing,” the company said in a blog post. “Together, these tools form the foundation of a full-stack Creative OS for professional work, while preserving the depth and control professional creatives rely on,” it added. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Besides Cavalry, Canva has also acquired stealth startup MangoAI, which was working on building reinforcement learning systems to improve video ad performance, according to its website. Canva said that the startup’s first product helped clients create and launch ads and observe outcomes to improve future campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MangoAI was built by Nirmal Govind, former Vice President of Data Science &amp;amp; Engineering at Netflix, and Vinith Misra, a former data scientist at Netflix and Roblox. Canva said that Govind will become Canva’s first ”&amp;nbsp;Chief Algorithms Officer” and Misra will work on improving Canva’s marketing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In January 2025, Canva acquired marketing intelligence startup Magicbrief and later last year, it launched a growth tool called Canva Grow for asset creation and performance measurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During a sit-down at Web Summit Qatar earlier this month, Canva co-founder and COO Cliff Obrecht told TechCrunch that Canva Grow is doing “incredibly well,” especially when it comes to creating static content and publishing it to Meta platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It is quite an early product, but we’ll soon be launching a lot more things around video creation, deploying across multi platform,” Obrecht had said. “So it’s very early, but it’s very much got a very loyal small user base, but a lot of big brands are spending money, and then we’re scaling up massively.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the new acquisitions, the company wants to bolster its position as a marketing solution by potentially adding video creation and more granular measurement. Canva closed 2025 at $4 billion in annualized revenue with more than 265 million users and 31 million paid users.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Monday, creative suite maker Canva announced the dual acquisition of startups Cavalry, which works on animation, and Mango AI, which works on improving ad performance.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, AI is finally making that problem solvable – and the market has responded with a reality check for one of technology’s oldest names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares recorded their worst single-day drop in more than 25 years earlier this week, plunging 13% after AI startup Anthropic said its Claude Code tool can accelerate COBOL modernisation – the kind of painstaking, expensive legacy work that has underpinned a portion of IBM’s consulting revenue for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Anthropic blog stated that “modernising a COBOL system once required armies of consultants spending years mapping workflows,” and argued that tools like Claude Code can now automate the exploration and analysis phases that consume most of the effort in COBOL modernisation. That single claim was enough to send investors reaching for the sell button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;COBOL is bigger than most realise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why the reaction was so sharp, it helps to understand just how entrenched COBOL remains. Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL code run in production daily, powering critical systems in finance and government sectors. The language handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deeper problem isn’t the code itself – it’s the people who understand it. The number of developers who understand COBOL continues to shrink as the workforce that built these systems has largely retired. That talent scarcity is precisely what made COBOL modernisation so expensive for so long, and what made large consulting engagements – the kind IBM and rivals like Accenture and Cognizant built profitable practices around – essentially unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic argues that AI flips this equation entirely. Claude Code works by mapping dependencies in thousands of lines of code, documenting workflows, identifying risks faster than human analysts, and providing teams with deep insights for informed decision-making. The company says teams can now modernise COBOL codebases in quarters not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;IBM was already here&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the market’s reaction may be overlooking is that IBM itself has been making this argument for some time. Anthropic’s post comes about three years after IBM itself suggested using AI to rewrite COBOL as Java and created a product called “watsonx Code Assistant for Z” to do it. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said as recently as July 2025 that the company’s AI coding assistant for mainframes “has got very adoption,” with the majority of customers using it to understand their COBOL codebase and decide what to modernise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM defended its position on Monday, saying its mainframe platform delivers the same quality of performance and security regardless of programming language – COBOL or otherwise. And analysts were quick to add nuance to the panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani noted that “clients already had the option to migrate from the mainframe, yet they are sticking with the platform,” suggesting the fear of displacement may be outrunning the reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The broader pattern&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM wasn’t alone in taking a hit. Accenture and Cognizant also declined following the news – a sign that investors are looking at the entire consulting model around legacy modernisation, not IBM’s mainframe hardware business. Just last week, cybersecurity stocks sold off sharply after Anthropic announced Claude Code Security, a tool that scans codebases for vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern is becoming familiar: each new AI ability announcement triggers a reassessment of which existing revenue streams might be compressed, and the market prices in fear immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM didn’t stay quiet. Rob Thomas, the company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, pushed back directly in the aforementioned blog post, drawing a line the market appeared to have missed: “Translating code is one thing. Modernising a platform is something else entirely. The two are not the same, and the gap between them is where most enterprises run into trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His argument is worth sitting with. The value IBM’s mainframe delivers, Thomas contends, has nothing to do with COBOL as a language – it lives in the vertically integrated stack underneath it: z/OS, transaction processing architecture, quantum-safe encryption, and decades of hardware-software optimisation that no code translation tool touches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s Claude Code, in his reading, is solving a real problem – just not the one that matters most for enterprises running IBM Z. He also raised a point that complicates the headline narrative further: roughly 40% of COBOL actually runs on Windows, Linux, and other distributed platforms – not mainframes at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of what’s being framed as an IBM mainframe story is partly a distributed systems problem that has been folded into a mainframe headline. IBM’s own clients are already making the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Canada has used IBM’s watsonx Code Assistant for Z to map dependencies and build modernisation blueprints for core applications. The National Organisation for Social Insurance reported a 94% reduction in time to analyse legacy COBOL code using the same tool – cutting an eight-hour task to roughly 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Monday’s selloff was a fair verdict or a reflexive one, the underlying change is real: AI is making COBOL modernisation economically viable for the first time in decades. The question IBM is asking – and the market hasn’t fully answered – is whether that’s a threat to its business or an acceleration of the transformation it’s already leading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hitachi bets on industrial expertise to win the physical AI race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This illegal activity is incredibly hard to disrupt, since it’s backed by sophisticated criminal networks and the perpetrators know that their chances of being caught are slim. With an annual value of $20 billion, according to Interpol, it’s the world’s fourth-most-lucrative criminal enterprise after trafficking in drugs, weapons, and people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The United Nations seeks to end trafficking in protected species by 2030. But the environmental guardians facing up to these nefarious networks—dispersed alliances of rangers, community groups, and law enforcement officers—have long been ill equipped and underfunded. A recent report by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime found “no reason for confidence” that the 2030 target would be reached.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, there is genuine hope that tech could help turn the tide. Tools initially developed for cities and research facilities are increasingly moving into the planet’s wild places, allowing environmental agencies and self-motivated communities in both richer and poorer countries to step up their efforts to detect illegal goods, trace smuggling networks, and prevent poaching at the source.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In December, Interpol announced it had seized record numbers of live animals, thanks in part to a set of sophisticated tools that had helped to expose hidden networks behind trafficking. Its Operation Thunder 2025 coordinated law enforcement agencies from 134 countries and seized 30,000 live animals, from apes to butterflies, using a suite of technologies including digital forensics and AI-driven detection. “The success of Thunder 2025 shows that modern threats demand modern tools,” says José Adrián Sanchez Romero, an operations coordinator at Interpol’s environmental security subdirectorate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are five examples of technologies that are arming conservationists and others in the battle to end wildlife crime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Researcher marks the horn of a subdued rhino on the ground" class="wp-image-1133246" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Rhisotope-Project-2025-4-edited.jpg" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE RHISOTOPE PROJECT&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tagging rhinos&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In July, a group of South African researchers announced they had won government approval for one of the most eyebrow-raising attempts to prevent wildlife crime: drilling radioactive substances into the horns of rhinoceroses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In an effort dubbed the Rhisotope Project, the group worked in 2024 and 2025 to fit 33 rhinos from Limpopo Rhino Orphanage in South Africa with pellets containing low-level radioactive isotopes. The project is supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Blood samples and veterinary exams have shown that the pellets don’t affect the health of the rhinos, the rangers, or the surrounding environment. But the isotope emits enough radiation for the horns to be detected by radiation portal monitors, devices that can scan cargo containers and vehicles to detect illicit sources of radiation. Eleven thousand such monitors are already in operation at airports and shipping terminals worldwide, in addition to thousands of personal monitors worn by border security. In November 2024,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Rhisotope tested the system at New York airports and harbors in collaboration with the US Customs and Border Patrol. The group found that border guards could detect an individual horn the team had planted inside a full 40-foot shipping container.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The project was pioneered by James Larkin, director of the radiation and health physics unit at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. Though the country is currently home to 15,000 rhinos, the majority of Africa’s total population, poachers have killed 10,000 rhinos there since 2007. In the past, the common approach to deterring poachers was to eliminate the part they’re seeking, preemptively cutting off the animal’s entire horn. But dehorning requires rhinos to be sedated for long periods, and it’s a stressful and costly process that must be repeated every 18 to 24 months, as rhino horns grow back. The act also renders rhinos less able to protect themselves, and they tend to withdraw from social interactions and competition for mates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new approach is far less painful and time-consuming. Each dose costs 21,500 South African rand (about $1,300) per animal and remains active for five years. Warning signs along perimeter fences make it clear the animals have been tagged, helping to deter poachers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Larkin, who spent his career as a nuclear safety expert, says he was initially wary when conservationists suggested to him that radioactive substances could help prevent rhino poaching, joking that he didn’t want to end up in jail if anyone got hurt. But he changed his mind when he realized there was a dose that would be harmless to bystanders while making the horns both worthless to smugglers and readily detectable. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Poachers will kill a rhino for even a small amount of horn, which can fetch $60,000 per kilogram as an ingredient for traditional medicines. Adding isotopes, though, renders the horns potentially unsafe to consume, and it’s hard for smugglers to reverse: “It’s almost impossible to remove isotopes unless you are a skilled radiation protection officer who knows what they are looking for,” Larkin says. Even so, he’s tight-lipped about the compound the pellets are made from and what they look like: “I don’t want to help criminals,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The South African health agency has now approved Rhisotope to roll out the program across the country. “We have a goal ultimately to treat up to 500 rhinos a year,” says Jessica Babich, chief executive of the project. At the same time, the group is working to adapt its approach to other popular poaching targets—elephant tusks and pangolin scales—as well as trafficked plants like cycads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A handheld portable scanner on the flank of a lizard" class="wp-image-1133239" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/XRF_device.jpg?w=1392" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF TARONGA CONSERVATION SOCIETY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="scan of a lizard" class="wp-image-1133234" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Rapiscan_8.jpg?w=1029" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF TARONGA CONSERVATION SOCIETY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scanning signatures&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many exotic pets, from birds to pythons, there are two parallel trades: a legal one in farmed or captive-bred animals and an illicit one in creatures taken from the wild. But faced with a lizard or a parrot, how can law enforcement know its origin story?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Australia, some conservationists have been trying to follow the numbers. It’s very hard to breed the egg-­laying mammals known as short-beaked echidnas. US zoos have yielded only 19 echidna babies, or “puggles,” in a century of efforts. So Indonesia’s yearly export of dozens of “captive-bred” echidnas has long raised suspicions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address the issue, a team at Australia’s Taronga Conservation Society, led by Kate Brandis, has developed an x-ray fluorescence (XRF) gun that can analyze elemental signatures in keratin—the stuff of quills, feathers, and hair. Wild echidnas, for instance, forage for a diverse diet of beetle larvae, ants, and grubs, while captive animals tend to be raised on a low-diversity diet of commercial feed. Each of these dietary histories leaves a record in the mammals’ porcupine-like spines, which can be read with high accuracy using a handheld XRF gun. Similar evidence can be found in other species, like cockatoos, pangolins, and turtles, which the team has used to test the device.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is certainly plenty more to be done: Australia, home to many unique species that live nowhere else on the planet, is a target for collectors from Asia, Europe, and the US. Brandis is targeting some of the species most often trafficked out of the country, including shingleback and blue-tongue lizards. Not long ago, Australian environmental authorities led a trial study at post offices across the country, using the XRF gun alongside AI-equipped parcel scanners, which Brandis’s team had trained to recognize concealed species in real time. The trial uncovered more than 100 legally protected lizards that were being shipped out of Australia; a distributor was sentenced to more than three years in jail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="serviceman at a control center looks at the Skylight AI app on a large wall display" class="wp-image-1133230" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/E08C5A59-E3D0-4552-BED9-C68B7CAAB8A4_1_105_c.jpg?w=718" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF SKYLIGHT AI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="person holds a phone with the app while looking at a nearby vessel at sea" class="wp-image-1133233" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Marine-Training-Program-11.jpg?w=1378" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF SKYLIGHT AI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AI in the sky&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Commercial fishing, scuba diving, and oil exploration are all prohibited in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument near Hawaii, an expanse of the Pacific larger than all US national parks combined. It is just one of a number of vast marine protected areas that have emerged in recent years, along with global pacts to conserve 30% of Earth’s land and sea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But establishing these reserves is just one step. Enforcing their protection is another matter. And for many marine reserves—especially those in the Global South—there is no real way to do that, says Ted Schmitt, senior director of conservation at the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI (AI2). Thousands of square kilometers of open ocean is a lot to monitor. Even with satellites scanning the marine areas, the reality until recently was that you had to know what you were looking for: “When you have the vastness of the ocean, you can have analysts who are very well trained, looking for vessels,” he says. Even then, there is little chance of finding wrongdoing without intelligence from the ground.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2017, Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen began developing a tool called Skylight to provide analysts with more of that intelligence, using AI to help analyze satellite and ship-tracking data to detect suspicious behavior. The project moved to AI2 after Allen’s death in 2018, and the technology has since been adopted by more than 200 organizations in more than 70 countries. “We’re basically monitoring the entire ocean 24-7-365, and surfacing all these vessels,” says Schmitt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To see how coast guards use the system, Schmitt points to a series of arrests in Panama in early 2025. That January, satellites found 16 boats about 200 kilometers off the coast inside the Coiba Ridge marine reserve, which serves as a migratory highway for sharks, rays, and large fish like yellowfin tuna. Skylight’s AI algorithms, trained to recognize the signature movements of various types of fishing, detected long-line fishing and requested higher-resolution images of the site from a commercial satellite flying overhead. The images and Skylight’s analysis were used by Panama’s environmental agency and military, which deployed ships and aircraft to the area, ultimately seizing six vessels and thousands of kilograms of illegally taken fish.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skylight AI detects around 300,000 vessels per week, according to the company’s platform analytics. Stories like Coiba Ridge make clear that AI can benefit partners who are working tirelessly on the ground, says Schmitt: “The Panama case really was one of those ‘wow’ moments, not because the technology finally proved itself, but because the agencies that needed to operationalize it, and actually take it to a legal finish, did it.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="closeup on the gloved hands of a man outside with a DNA test kit" class="wp-image-1133232" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8831.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF WILDTECHDNA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rapid DNA tests&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the conservation scientist Natalie Schmitt was researching snow leopards in remote areas of Nepal, she worked with people who could point out signs of these elusive big cats—often a pile of droppings. But the results weren’t reliable: Leopard scat can easily be confused with the poop of wolves and foxes, which share the same habitat and prey, she explains. What Schmitt wanted was a tool that could identify the animal involved, right on the spot—ideally by finding a way to sequence the DNA in the scat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While some laboratories can take DNA samples of such material and identify species of interest, they are few and far between in rich countries and usually nonexistent in poorer countries, meaning that this process can be weeks long and involve shipping samples cross-country or across borders. This is a problem not just for field research but for wildlife trafficking enforcement. Imagine a border agent who has just opened a box of shark-like fins or a shipment of live parrots and needs to know whether the particular species is one that can legally be captured and transported. People in this situation don’t have weeks to spare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Schmitt founded WildTechDNA, which has developed a DNA test that aims to do that work on the fly. The test, which is about as easy and fast as a home pregnancy test, employs a simple two-step process. First, a new extraction method—“Literally, put the sample in the extraction tube and squeeze 10 times,” she says—can cut the time it takes to pull DNA out of a sample from a day to about three minutes. Then, to actually test that DNA, the company took inspiration from the covid pandemic. The researchers found they could use technology similar to rapid at-home tests to identify whether the DNA in question belongs to a specific species: “Our tests use very simple lateral-flow strips to tell you whether a sample belongs to your target species of interest, yes or no.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The strips can be tailored to test for a wide range of targets, from big cats to microbes, opening up diverse applications in the wild. They can tell if samples of hair belong to a snow leopard, or if a frog has been infected with the fungi that cause chytridiomycosis, a disease that has devastated amphibians worldwide and wiped out at least 90 species.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;WildTechDNA’s earliest adopter was the Canadian government, which wanted to detect European eels—a critically endangered species that is effectively impossible to identify by appearance. This confusion has allowed €3 billion of European eels to be smuggled each year, disguised as other eel species. Some of that passes into Canada on its way to suppliers in Japan and China, and in some cases on to Canadian restaurants and consumers. “When a shipment is suspected to contain European eel, they’ll randomly sample it and they’ll send those samples off to a lab across the country, which will take three weeks,” says Schmitt of traditional tracking methods. WildTechDNA developed tests specific to European eels and taught Canadian enforcement officers how to use them, so that they could launch a “nationwide European eel blitz,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a 2025 campaign, European eels turned up in fewer than 1% of shipments. Schmitt says Canadian authorities have not disclosed details about investigations but are encouraged by the results—significantly below the rates detected using older technologies in 2016, an improvement they attribute to better surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to affordable camera traps and animal-mounted GPS tags, low-cost solar-powered microphones have proved to be strikingly effective at revealing what’s living in some of the planet’s most densely inhabited and biodiverse environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rainforest Connection, a nonprofit founded by the physicist turned conservation-­tech entrepreneur Topher White in 2014, was a pioneer in bioacoustic monitoring for conservation. The group initially repurposed old phones into low-cost monitoring devices but has since developed a standardized device called the Guardian that has now been deployed in more than 600 locations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Guardians are designed to capture a broad soundscape of the rainforest: “They sit out in the rainforest for long periods of time, up in treetops. They’re solar-powered, they can last for years, and we listen to all the sounds continuously and transmit that up to the cloud, where we are then able to analyze it for all sorts of things,” says White. From the outset, the aim was to use these devices to pick up immediate threats—“chainsaws, logging trucks, gunshots, things like that,” White says—and relay real-time alerts to local partners, including police, Indigenous groups, and local communities that protect the land.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133238" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Setting-up-a-Guardian_5.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAINFOREST CONNECTION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Guardian device in a tree canopy" class="wp-image-1133229" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DJI_0018.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAINFOREST CONNECTION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bioacoustic monitoring devices have rapidly advanced in recent years. Many can now analyze data before transmitting it, and they’ve become cheaper to make as batteries have gotten smaller. By today’s standards, Rainforest Connection’s sensors are “over-engineered,” says White. But having a large number of detectors already deployed means there is ample data that can be mined for signals beyond well-known red flags, like gunshots. “An area for a lot more innovation going forward is to use the soundscape itself as a detector,” White says. Rainforest Connection and the German software firm SAP tested this approach on the island of Sumatra and found they could identify human intruders by using machine learning to hunt for “uncharacteristic sudden changes to the soundscape.” For example, tracking animal calls—and noting when those animals go silent—could reveal the arrival of poachers. In 2026, Rainforest Connection will roll out this approach to reserves in Thailand, Jamaica, and Romania by building a unique model for each environment, trained on thousands of hours of audio and verified using camera traps. “We have a lot of eyes and ears in the forest already, all of which are aware and reacting to each other and to new stimuli,” White says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, Rainforest Connection’s unfiltered stream has another use: an app where you can listen to the livestream from the Ecuadorian rainforest, taking in the complete soundscape of birdsong, frog chatter, and cicada chirps.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew Ponsford is a freelance reporter based in London.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every year, poachers shoot hundreds of rhinos, fishing crews haul millions of sharks out of protected seas, and smugglers carry countless animals and plants across borders. This illegal activity is incredibly hard to disrupt, since it’s backed by sophisticated criminal networks and the perpetrators know that their chances of being caught are slim. With an annual value of $20 billion, according to Interpol, it’s the world’s fourth-most-lucrative criminal enterprise after trafficking in drugs, weapons, and people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The United Nations seeks to end trafficking in protected species by 2030. But the environmental guardians facing up to these nefarious networks—dispersed alliances of rangers, community groups, and law enforcement officers—have long been ill equipped and underfunded. A recent report by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime found “no reason for confidence” that the 2030 target would be reached.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, there is genuine hope that tech could help turn the tide. Tools initially developed for cities and research facilities are increasingly moving into the planet’s wild places, allowing environmental agencies and self-motivated communities in both richer and poorer countries to step up their efforts to detect illegal goods, trace smuggling networks, and prevent poaching at the source.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In December, Interpol announced it had seized record numbers of live animals, thanks in part to a set of sophisticated tools that had helped to expose hidden networks behind trafficking. Its Operation Thunder 2025 coordinated law enforcement agencies from 134 countries and seized 30,000 live animals, from apes to butterflies, using a suite of technologies including digital forensics and AI-driven detection. “The success of Thunder 2025 shows that modern threats demand modern tools,” says José Adrián Sanchez Romero, an operations coordinator at Interpol’s environmental security subdirectorate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are five examples of technologies that are arming conservationists and others in the battle to end wildlife crime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Researcher marks the horn of a subdued rhino on the ground" class="wp-image-1133246" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Rhisotope-Project-2025-4-edited.jpg" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE RHISOTOPE PROJECT&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tagging rhinos&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In July, a group of South African researchers announced they had won government approval for one of the most eyebrow-raising attempts to prevent wildlife crime: drilling radioactive substances into the horns of rhinoceroses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In an effort dubbed the Rhisotope Project, the group worked in 2024 and 2025 to fit 33 rhinos from Limpopo Rhino Orphanage in South Africa with pellets containing low-level radioactive isotopes. The project is supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Blood samples and veterinary exams have shown that the pellets don’t affect the health of the rhinos, the rangers, or the surrounding environment. But the isotope emits enough radiation for the horns to be detected by radiation portal monitors, devices that can scan cargo containers and vehicles to detect illicit sources of radiation. Eleven thousand such monitors are already in operation at airports and shipping terminals worldwide, in addition to thousands of personal monitors worn by border security. In November 2024,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Rhisotope tested the system at New York airports and harbors in collaboration with the US Customs and Border Patrol. The group found that border guards could detect an individual horn the team had planted inside a full 40-foot shipping container.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The project was pioneered by James Larkin, director of the radiation and health physics unit at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. Though the country is currently home to 15,000 rhinos, the majority of Africa’s total population, poachers have killed 10,000 rhinos there since 2007. In the past, the common approach to deterring poachers was to eliminate the part they’re seeking, preemptively cutting off the animal’s entire horn. But dehorning requires rhinos to be sedated for long periods, and it’s a stressful and costly process that must be repeated every 18 to 24 months, as rhino horns grow back. The act also renders rhinos less able to protect themselves, and they tend to withdraw from social interactions and competition for mates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new approach is far less painful and time-consuming. Each dose costs 21,500 South African rand (about $1,300) per animal and remains active for five years. Warning signs along perimeter fences make it clear the animals have been tagged, helping to deter poachers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Larkin, who spent his career as a nuclear safety expert, says he was initially wary when conservationists suggested to him that radioactive substances could help prevent rhino poaching, joking that he didn’t want to end up in jail if anyone got hurt. But he changed his mind when he realized there was a dose that would be harmless to bystanders while making the horns both worthless to smugglers and readily detectable. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Poachers will kill a rhino for even a small amount of horn, which can fetch $60,000 per kilogram as an ingredient for traditional medicines. Adding isotopes, though, renders the horns potentially unsafe to consume, and it’s hard for smugglers to reverse: “It’s almost impossible to remove isotopes unless you are a skilled radiation protection officer who knows what they are looking for,” Larkin says. Even so, he’s tight-lipped about the compound the pellets are made from and what they look like: “I don’t want to help criminals,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The South African health agency has now approved Rhisotope to roll out the program across the country. “We have a goal ultimately to treat up to 500 rhinos a year,” says Jessica Babich, chief executive of the project. At the same time, the group is working to adapt its approach to other popular poaching targets—elephant tusks and pangolin scales—as well as trafficked plants like cycads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A handheld portable scanner on the flank of a lizard" class="wp-image-1133239" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/XRF_device.jpg?w=1392" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF TARONGA CONSERVATION SOCIETY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="scan of a lizard" class="wp-image-1133234" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Rapiscan_8.jpg?w=1029" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF TARONGA CONSERVATION SOCIETY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scanning signatures&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many exotic pets, from birds to pythons, there are two parallel trades: a legal one in farmed or captive-bred animals and an illicit one in creatures taken from the wild. But faced with a lizard or a parrot, how can law enforcement know its origin story?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Australia, some conservationists have been trying to follow the numbers. It’s very hard to breed the egg-­laying mammals known as short-beaked echidnas. US zoos have yielded only 19 echidna babies, or “puggles,” in a century of efforts. So Indonesia’s yearly export of dozens of “captive-bred” echidnas has long raised suspicions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address the issue, a team at Australia’s Taronga Conservation Society, led by Kate Brandis, has developed an x-ray fluorescence (XRF) gun that can analyze elemental signatures in keratin—the stuff of quills, feathers, and hair. Wild echidnas, for instance, forage for a diverse diet of beetle larvae, ants, and grubs, while captive animals tend to be raised on a low-diversity diet of commercial feed. Each of these dietary histories leaves a record in the mammals’ porcupine-like spines, which can be read with high accuracy using a handheld XRF gun. Similar evidence can be found in other species, like cockatoos, pangolins, and turtles, which the team has used to test the device.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is certainly plenty more to be done: Australia, home to many unique species that live nowhere else on the planet, is a target for collectors from Asia, Europe, and the US. Brandis is targeting some of the species most often trafficked out of the country, including shingleback and blue-tongue lizards. Not long ago, Australian environmental authorities led a trial study at post offices across the country, using the XRF gun alongside AI-equipped parcel scanners, which Brandis’s team had trained to recognize concealed species in real time. The trial uncovered more than 100 legally protected lizards that were being shipped out of Australia; a distributor was sentenced to more than three years in jail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="serviceman at a control center looks at the Skylight AI app on a large wall display" class="wp-image-1133230" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/E08C5A59-E3D0-4552-BED9-C68B7CAAB8A4_1_105_c.jpg?w=718" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF SKYLIGHT AI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="person holds a phone with the app while looking at a nearby vessel at sea" class="wp-image-1133233" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Marine-Training-Program-11.jpg?w=1378" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF SKYLIGHT AI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AI in the sky&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Commercial fishing, scuba diving, and oil exploration are all prohibited in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument near Hawaii, an expanse of the Pacific larger than all US national parks combined. It is just one of a number of vast marine protected areas that have emerged in recent years, along with global pacts to conserve 30% of Earth’s land and sea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But establishing these reserves is just one step. Enforcing their protection is another matter. And for many marine reserves—especially those in the Global South—there is no real way to do that, says Ted Schmitt, senior director of conservation at the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI (AI2). Thousands of square kilometers of open ocean is a lot to monitor. Even with satellites scanning the marine areas, the reality until recently was that you had to know what you were looking for: “When you have the vastness of the ocean, you can have analysts who are very well trained, looking for vessels,” he says. Even then, there is little chance of finding wrongdoing without intelligence from the ground.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2017, Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen began developing a tool called Skylight to provide analysts with more of that intelligence, using AI to help analyze satellite and ship-tracking data to detect suspicious behavior. The project moved to AI2 after Allen’s death in 2018, and the technology has since been adopted by more than 200 organizations in more than 70 countries. “We’re basically monitoring the entire ocean 24-7-365, and surfacing all these vessels,” says Schmitt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To see how coast guards use the system, Schmitt points to a series of arrests in Panama in early 2025. That January, satellites found 16 boats about 200 kilometers off the coast inside the Coiba Ridge marine reserve, which serves as a migratory highway for sharks, rays, and large fish like yellowfin tuna. Skylight’s AI algorithms, trained to recognize the signature movements of various types of fishing, detected long-line fishing and requested higher-resolution images of the site from a commercial satellite flying overhead. The images and Skylight’s analysis were used by Panama’s environmental agency and military, which deployed ships and aircraft to the area, ultimately seizing six vessels and thousands of kilograms of illegally taken fish.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skylight AI detects around 300,000 vessels per week, according to the company’s platform analytics. Stories like Coiba Ridge make clear that AI can benefit partners who are working tirelessly on the ground, says Schmitt: “The Panama case really was one of those ‘wow’ moments, not because the technology finally proved itself, but because the agencies that needed to operationalize it, and actually take it to a legal finish, did it.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="closeup on the gloved hands of a man outside with a DNA test kit" class="wp-image-1133232" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8831.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF WILDTECHDNA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rapid DNA tests&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the conservation scientist Natalie Schmitt was researching snow leopards in remote areas of Nepal, she worked with people who could point out signs of these elusive big cats—often a pile of droppings. But the results weren’t reliable: Leopard scat can easily be confused with the poop of wolves and foxes, which share the same habitat and prey, she explains. What Schmitt wanted was a tool that could identify the animal involved, right on the spot—ideally by finding a way to sequence the DNA in the scat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While some laboratories can take DNA samples of such material and identify species of interest, they are few and far between in rich countries and usually nonexistent in poorer countries, meaning that this process can be weeks long and involve shipping samples cross-country or across borders. This is a problem not just for field research but for wildlife trafficking enforcement. Imagine a border agent who has just opened a box of shark-like fins or a shipment of live parrots and needs to know whether the particular species is one that can legally be captured and transported. People in this situation don’t have weeks to spare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Schmitt founded WildTechDNA, which has developed a DNA test that aims to do that work on the fly. The test, which is about as easy and fast as a home pregnancy test, employs a simple two-step process. First, a new extraction method—“Literally, put the sample in the extraction tube and squeeze 10 times,” she says—can cut the time it takes to pull DNA out of a sample from a day to about three minutes. Then, to actually test that DNA, the company took inspiration from the covid pandemic. The researchers found they could use technology similar to rapid at-home tests to identify whether the DNA in question belongs to a specific species: “Our tests use very simple lateral-flow strips to tell you whether a sample belongs to your target species of interest, yes or no.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The strips can be tailored to test for a wide range of targets, from big cats to microbes, opening up diverse applications in the wild. They can tell if samples of hair belong to a snow leopard, or if a frog has been infected with the fungi that cause chytridiomycosis, a disease that has devastated amphibians worldwide and wiped out at least 90 species.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;WildTechDNA’s earliest adopter was the Canadian government, which wanted to detect European eels—a critically endangered species that is effectively impossible to identify by appearance. This confusion has allowed €3 billion of European eels to be smuggled each year, disguised as other eel species. Some of that passes into Canada on its way to suppliers in Japan and China, and in some cases on to Canadian restaurants and consumers. “When a shipment is suspected to contain European eel, they’ll randomly sample it and they’ll send those samples off to a lab across the country, which will take three weeks,” says Schmitt of traditional tracking methods. WildTechDNA developed tests specific to European eels and taught Canadian enforcement officers how to use them, so that they could launch a “nationwide European eel blitz,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a 2025 campaign, European eels turned up in fewer than 1% of shipments. Schmitt says Canadian authorities have not disclosed details about investigations but are encouraged by the results—significantly below the rates detected using older technologies in 2016, an improvement they attribute to better surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to affordable camera traps and animal-mounted GPS tags, low-cost solar-powered microphones have proved to be strikingly effective at revealing what’s living in some of the planet’s most densely inhabited and biodiverse environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rainforest Connection, a nonprofit founded by the physicist turned conservation-­tech entrepreneur Topher White in 2014, was a pioneer in bioacoustic monitoring for conservation. The group initially repurposed old phones into low-cost monitoring devices but has since developed a standardized device called the Guardian that has now been deployed in more than 600 locations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Guardians are designed to capture a broad soundscape of the rainforest: “They sit out in the rainforest for long periods of time, up in treetops. They’re solar-powered, they can last for years, and we listen to all the sounds continuously and transmit that up to the cloud, where we are then able to analyze it for all sorts of things,” says White. From the outset, the aim was to use these devices to pick up immediate threats—“chainsaws, logging trucks, gunshots, things like that,” White says—and relay real-time alerts to local partners, including police, Indigenous groups, and local communities that protect the land.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133238" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Setting-up-a-Guardian_5.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAINFOREST CONNECTION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Guardian device in a tree canopy" class="wp-image-1133229" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DJI_0018.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAINFOREST CONNECTION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bioacoustic monitoring devices have rapidly advanced in recent years. Many can now analyze data before transmitting it, and they’ve become cheaper to make as batteries have gotten smaller. By today’s standards, Rainforest Connection’s sensors are “over-engineered,” says White. But having a large number of detectors already deployed means there is ample data that can be mined for signals beyond well-known red flags, like gunshots. “An area for a lot more innovation going forward is to use the soundscape itself as a detector,” White says. Rainforest Connection and the German software firm SAP tested this approach on the island of Sumatra and found they could identify human intruders by using machine learning to hunt for “uncharacteristic sudden changes to the soundscape.” For example, tracking animal calls—and noting when those animals go silent—could reveal the arrival of poachers. In 2026, Rainforest Connection will roll out this approach to reserves in Thailand, Jamaica, and Romania by building a unique model for each environment, trained on thousands of hours of audio and verified using camera traps. “We have a lot of eyes and ears in the forest already, all of which are aware and reacting to each other and to new stimuli,” White says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, Rainforest Connection’s unfiltered stream has another use: an app where you can listen to the livestream from the Ecuadorian rainforest, taking in the complete soundscape of birdsong, frog chatter, and cicada chirps.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew Ponsford is a freelance reporter based in London.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/24/1132760/conservationists-making-rhinos-radioactive/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] We’re putting more stuff into space than ever.

Jesper Persson from the company said there had been benefits. “Since day one, we’ve perceived the desired values from the project. The quality of invoices has improved considerably, and the AI continues to evolve and improve with each passing day. The efficiency gains we achieved translated directly into tangible cost savings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company’s objective is to have finance teams delegate decisions and actions to agents in the future, and it plans to release more AI tools in 2026. The company states that AI is in its platform not an add-on feature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/invoicing-agentic-ai-baswares-ai-agents-from-invoicing-to-100-automated/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 12:14:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
