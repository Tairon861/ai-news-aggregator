Rubin is capable of capturing many more stars than any other astronomical observatory ever built; it also sees many more satellites. Up to 40% of images captured by the observatory within its first 10 years of operation will be marred by their sunlight-reflecting streaks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meredith Rawls, a research scientist at the telescope’s flagship observation project, Vera Rubin’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time, is one of the experts tasked with protecting Rubin’s science mission from the satellite blight, which could make observations more difficult because the satellites are millions of times brighter than the faint stars and galaxies it hopes to study. Satellites could also confuse astronomers when the sudden brightening they cause gets mistaken for astronomical phenomena.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An unexpected path&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Rawls joined the Rubin project in 2016, she says, she had no clue what turn her career would take. “I was hired as a postdoc to help build a new imaging pipeline to process precursor images [and] analyze results to identify things we needed to fix or change,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2019, SpaceX began deploying its internet-beaming Starlink constellation, and the astronomical community started to sound alarm bells. The satellites were orbiting too low and reflected too much sunlight, leaving bright marks in telescope images. A year later, Rawls and a handful of her colleagues were the first to make a scientific assessment of the satellite streaks’ effect on astronomical observations, using images from the Víctor M. Blanco telescope (which, like Rubin, is in Chile). “We wanted to see how bright those streaks were and look at possible mitigation strategies,” Rawls says. Her team found that although the streaks weren’t overwhelmingly bright, they still risked affecting scientific observations.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Streak removal&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since those early observations, an entirely new subdiscipline of astronomical image processing has emerged, focusing on techniques to remove satellite light pollution from the data and designing observation protocols to prevent too-bright satellites from spoiling the views. Rawls has become one of the leading experts in the fast-evolving field, which is only set to grow in importance in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We are fundamentally altering the night sky by launching a lot more stuff at an unsustainably increasing rate,” says Rawls, who is also an astronomy researcher at the University of Washington.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To mitigate the damage, she and her colleagues designed algorithms that compare images of the same spot in the sky to detect unexpected changes and determine whether those could have been caused by passing satellites or natural phenomena like asteroids or stellar explosions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A rising force&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The number of satellites orbiting our planet has risen from a mere thousand some 15 years ago to more than 12,000 active satellites today. About 8,000 of those belong to SpaceX’s Starlink, but other ventures threaten to worsen the light-pollution problem in the coming years. US-based AST SpaceMobile, for example, is building a constellation of giant orbiting antenna arrays to beam 5G connectivity directly to users’ phones. The first five of these satellites—each over 60 square meters in size—are already in orbit and reflecting so much light that Rubin must adjust its observing schedule to avoid their paths.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“So far, what we’ve seen with the initial images is that it’s a nuisance but not a science-ending thing,” says Rawls. She remains optimistic that she and her colleagues can stay on top of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tereza Pultarova is a London-based science and technology journalist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SatelliteErasure-thumb.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the $800 million Vera Rubin Observatory commenced its decade-long quest to create an extremely detailed time-lapse movie of the universe.

Now, he is among almost 200 contractors involved in the Delhi government’s effort to shift from this manual process to safer mechanical methods.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although it has been outlawed since 1993, manual scavenging—the practice of extracting human excreta from toilets, sewers, or septic tanks—is still practiced widely in India. The work is usually done by people who belong to what are considered the lowest castes, known as the Scheduled Castes or Dalits. Not only is the job undignified, but it can be extremely dangerous: People who enter clogged sewers to clean them face the risk of asphyxiation from exposure to toxic gases like ammonia and methane. According to data presented in the Indian parliament, manual scavenging was responsible for more than 500 deaths between 2018 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several companies have emerged to offer alternatives at a wide range of technical complexity. For example, Genrobotics, based in Kerala, has developed the “Bandicoot Robot” (shown above), a mechanical scavenger that features robotic legs, night-vision cameras, and the ability to detect toxic gas. Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology in Chennai have developed a robot for septic tanks that has a suction mechanism to pump out the slurry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 220 Bandicoot robots have been deployed in India, says Vipin Govind, head of marketing and communications at Genrobotics. The company’s reach, he says, enables “even resource-constrained municipalities” to deploy the technology effectively.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Despite these technological options, a 2021 report by the Ministry of Social Justice &amp;amp; Empowerment found that there are still more than 58,000 manual scavengers across India. Independent observers say the numbers are even higher.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The machine that Jitender uses is mounted on a pickup truck and uses rotating rods, high-pressure streams of water, and a mechanical claw to break up blockages and remove debris. “Earlier, a sanitation worker would get into a sewer and clear the drain with some equipment, but now with these machines we just drop the nozzle into the drain and turn on the pump,” he says. But Vijay Shehriyar, part of the same Delhi initiative, explains that the machines have not entirely replaced manual scavenging in the city. “The manual cleaning is still employed at many places, especially in narrow lanes,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bezwada Wilson, an activist who has long campaigned for the eradication of manual scavenging, explains that most of the drainage and sewage systems across the country are not well planned and were built without proper engineering oversight. Any solution would need to take into consideration all the resulting differences in infrastructure, he says: “It can’t be that you come up with an alternative and force it upon the drainage system without understanding its nature.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamaad Habibullah is a freelance journalist based in New Delhi.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bandicoot-Operator-Technopark-1-thumb.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Jitender was a child in New Delhi, both his parents worked as manual scavengers—a job that involved clearing the city’s sewers of solid waste by hand.

But Vijay Shehriyar, part of the same Delhi initiative, explains that the machines have not entirely replaced manual scavenging in the city. “The manual cleaning is still employed at many places, especially in narrow lanes,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bezwada Wilson, an activist who has long campaigned for the eradication of manual scavenging, explains that most of the drainage and sewage systems across the country are not well planned and were built without proper engineering oversight. Any solution would need to take into consideration all the resulting differences in infrastructure, he says: “It can’t be that you come up with an alternative and force it upon the drainage system without understanding its nature.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamaad Habibullah is a freelance journalist based in New Delhi.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/27/1121423/india-sewer-robots-sanitation/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>AI comes for the job market, security, and prosperity: The Debrief (Artificial intelligence – MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/27/1121475/editors-letter-security-issue-mat-honan/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I picked up my daughter from summer camp, we settled in for an eight-hour drive through the Appalachian mountains, heading from North Carolina to her grandparents’ home in Kentucky. With little to no cell service for much of the drive, we enjoyed the rare opportunity to have a long, thoughtful conversation, uninterrupted by devices. The subject, naturally, turned to AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mat Honan" class="wp-image-1119107" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/mat_debrief.png?w=1012" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“No one my age &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; AI. No one is excited about it,” she told me of her high-school-age peers. Why not? I asked. “Because,” she replied, “it seems like all the jobs we thought we wanted to do are going to go away.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was struck by her pessimism, which she told me was shared by friends from California to Georgia to New Hampshire. In an already fragile world, one increasingly beset by climate change and the breakdown of the international order, AI looms in the background, threatening young people’s ability to secure a prosperous future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s an understandable concern. Just a few days before our drive, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was telling the US Federal Reserve’s board of governors that AI agents will leave entire job categories “just like totally, totally gone.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; he believes AI will wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company will eliminate jobs in favor of AI agents in the coming years. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke told staff they had to prove that new roles couldn’t be done by AI before making a hire. And the view is not limited to tech. Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, recently said he expects AI to replace half of all white-collar jobs in the US.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;These are no longer mere theoretical projections. There is already evidence that AI is affecting employment. Hiring of new grads is down, for example, in sectors like tech and finance. While that is not entirely due to AI, the technology is almost certainly playing a role.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Gen Z, the issue is broader than employment. It also touches on another massive generational challenge: climate change. AI is computationally intensive and requires massive data centers. Huge complexes have already been built all across the country, from Virginia in the east to Nevada in the west. That buildout is only going to accelerate as companies race to be first to create superintelligence. Meta and OpenAI have announced plans for data centers that will require five gigawatts of power just for their ­computing—enough to power the entire state of Maine in the summertime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s very likely that utilities will turn to natural gas to power these facilities; some already have. That means more carbon dioxide emissions for an already warming world. Data centers also require vast amounts of water. There are communities right now that are literally running out of water because it’s being taken by nearby data centers, even as climate change makes that resource more scarce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Proponents argue that AI will make the grid more efficient, that it will help us achieve technological breakthroughs leading to cleaner energy sources and, I don’t know, more butterflies and bumblebees? But xAI is belching CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the Memphis skies from its methane-fueled generators&lt;em&gt; right now&lt;/em&gt;. Google’s electricity demand and emissions are skyrocketing &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Things would be different, my daughter told me, if it were obviously useful. But for much of her generation, she argued, it’s a looming threat with ample costs and no obvious utility: “It’s not good for research because it’s not highly accurate. You can’t use it for writing because it’s banned—and people get zeros on papers who haven’t even used it because of AI detectors. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; it seems like it’s going to take all the good jobs. One teacher told us we’re all going to be janitors.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It would be naïve to think we are going back to a world without AI. We’re not. And yet there are other urgent problems that we need to address to build security and prosperity for coming generations.

Yet the industry faces some daunting challenges if the vision is to be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of decentralisation imagine a world where AI is not controlled by a select few big tech corporations, but rather by a global community that invites everyone to participate and have their say. It’s an audacious goal, but as it slowly comes into view, a question arises – are we really on the cusp of democratising access to intelligent automation, or are we creating a recipe for disaster?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-dream-of-decentralised-artificial-intelligence"&gt;The dream of decentralised artificial intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best known AI models in the world are controlled by a few select companies – OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, DeepSeek et al. – creating a familiar feeling that the AI industry, much like today’s internet, will be dominated by a handful of all-powerful monarchs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has fueled the desire for a more equitable and open AI landscape, and it has attracted some vocal supporters. The founder of Stabiliy AI Emad Mostaque made headlines when he sensationally quit his role in March 2024, saying he wanted to “pursue decentralised AI” in order to ensure that the technology remains open and accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostaque’s vision resonates with legislators. In France, the Competition Authority Chief Benoît Cœuré pointed out that AI is the first technology that has been “dominated by major players from the outset”, and pointed to decentralised AI as the only chance to change this state of affairs before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who champion decentralised AI argue it will lead to a world where individual developers, students, startups and hobbyists will be able to pool their knowledge, computing resources and data to enable anyone to participate, resulting in what MIT says will be “democratised innovation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also point to transparency as another major benefit, with open AI models running on blockchain, ensuring that any biased or toxic algorithms will quickly be identified and rejected. Greyscale Research, in a study, found that open networks do indeed have the ability to eliminate bias in AI, in stark contrast to the opaque, centralised models used today, which are often referred to as “black boxes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other benefits of decentralised AI include resistance to censorship and accessibility. The likes of Google and OpenAI typically bake in content filters, blocking their models from discussing or answering questions on certain topics, and charge for access. While decentralised models may also have content filters, their open nature means that these can easily be bypassed. Moreover, no one can charge for access to a decentralised, community-owned model, which means use isn’t restricted to only those with the financial means to pay for access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general consensus among the decentralised AI community is that the world will be much better off if this technology is collectively owned and open to contributions from every corner of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-reality-might-be-different"&gt;The reality might be different&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of these positives, the decentralised AI industry must run through a gauntlet of formidable challenges to live up to this vision. By bringing AI out of its carefully controlled, centralised data centres and letting it loose on a global network owned by everyone, it opens it up to numerous risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most difficult questions pertains to data integrity and synchronisation. Mechanisms like federated learning can solve the latter challenge, but it doesn’t provide much of a solution to the risk of data poisoning, which could skew the outputs of decentralised models. We can, perhaps, add a blockchain layer to increase transparency, but this may increase complexity, complicating data processing tasks and slowing down innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are well-founded concerns that, while distributed networks mean lower costs and potentially reduced bias, these benefits come at the sacrifice of efficiency, which can hamstring the capabilities of decentralised AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for immense computational resources is a barrier, too. While Chinese firms like DeepSeek have apparently achieved success with more limited resources, generally the most sophisticated AI models require access to vast numbers of powerful GPUs. Acquiring these resources, and coordinating them, remains a major challenge for decentralised networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are some promising solutions to this. For instance, 0G Labs recently announced a promising breakthrough in the shape of its DiLoCoX framework, which breaks down model training tasks to their individual parts, spreading them in multiple nodes so they can be done in parallel, before synchronising the results with the network once these training jobs are completed. In doing this, 0G claims to be able to train vastly more powerful decentralised models on only limited resources, regardless of the available network bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By enabling the training of massive AI models on slower and cheaper networks, and with more accessible hardware than a high-speed data centre, even smaller businesses and individuals will be able to train their own advanced models with speed and accuracy,” says 0G Labs CEO, Michael Heinrich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the solutions for issues around decentralised AI’s security are less apparent. It’s something of a paradox, because while decentralised control significantly reduces the risk of a single point of failure, it also increases the attack surface to a potentially infinite number of endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there are still questions around the governance of decentralised AI models. For instance, who makes the decisions on what parts of the model should be improved, what guardrails should be built in, and so on? And who is accountable should any problems arise with a decentralised model?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of accountability could lead to a kind of “ethical vacuum”, resulting in massive abuse of decentralised AI models that are every bit as powerful as their centralised cousins, with extremely negative consequences. As a solution, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin has proposed a kind of hybrid model, with “AI serving as the engine and humans sitting behind the wheel.” The approach, Vitalik believes, would combine AI’s power with human judgment to create a more balanced and decentralised system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decentralised-a"&gt;Decentralised A&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralised AI’s future remains uncertain, and while its development is motivated by grand intentions, the path ahead will be tricky to navigate. For advocates, it’s the only way we’re ever going to democratise AI technology and unlock its true potential. Critics, on the other hand, point to the ethical challenges and the alarming potential for abuse, due to the lack of accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it’s clear that the decentralised AI community is pushing forward anyway, in spite of these risks. For believers, the dream of a truly open, transparent, community-led AI industry that’s accessible to all is just too powerful to ignore, and so there’s nothing to stop them. We’ll just have to hope that as they pursue this dream, they don’t lose sight of the risks and take time to build the guardrails that can prevent things from getting out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/igor-omilaev-9XtKSci9crg-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralised artificial intelligence has been hailed as one of the most profound innovations of our time, promising to give users control of the most transformative technologies.

As a solution, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin has proposed a kind of hybrid model, with “AI serving as the engine and humans sitting behind the wheel.” The approach, Vitalik believes, would combine AI’s power with human judgment to create a more balanced and decentralised system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decentralised-a"&gt;Decentralised A&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralised AI’s future remains uncertain, and while its development is motivated by grand intentions, the path ahead will be tricky to navigate. For advocates, it’s the only way we’re ever going to democratise AI technology and unlock its true potential. Critics, on the other hand, point to the ethical challenges and the alarming potential for abuse, due to the lack of accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it’s clear that the decentralised AI community is pushing forward anyway, in spite of these risks. For believers, the dream of a truly open, transparent, community-led AI industry that’s accessible to all is just too powerful to ignore, and so there’s nothing to stop them. We’ll just have to hope that as they pursue this dream, they don’t lose sight of the risks and take time to build the guardrails that can prevent things from getting out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/decentralised-ai-full-of-promise-but-not-without-challenges/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 10:24:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Zopa: AI to automate banking, threaten finance jobs (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/zopa-ai-automate-banking-threaten-finance-jobs/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;AI is transforming the banking industry, but the expected benefits and savings come at great human cost with the impact on finance jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report, a collaboration between digital bank Zopa and Juniper Research, forecasts that generative AI will deliver £1.8 billion in cost savings by 2030, driven by an equivalent level of investment. However, this 100 percent investment return comes at a large human cost—placing an estimated 27,000 finance industry jobs at risk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that AI technologies are moving beyond experimental pilots and becoming deeply embedded in the core processes of banking, from customer service to the unseen functions of the back office.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Donlon, Chief Technology Officer at Zopa, said: “GenAI marks a paradigm shift in applied computing. Its influence on productivity, software creation, and decisionmaking systems could rival the advent of the internet or cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At Zopa, we’ve been operationalising machine learning for over a decade, well before LLMs became mainstream. That depth of experience has shaped our belief that GenAI isn’t a feature add-on, but a foundational capability. For Zopa technologists, it’s a rare chance to build entirely new intelligence layers, at a level that will redefine the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-silent-ai-revolution-in-the-back-offices-of-banks"&gt;The silent AI revolution in the back offices of banks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While customer-facing chatbots and personalised app experiences often capture the headlines, the report reveals that the most dramatic impact of AI is occurring behind the scenes. 82 percent of all time saved through this technology, amounting to 154 million hours by 2030, will come from back office operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These functions – which include regulatory compliance, fraud detection, and risk management – are traditionally labour-intensive and highly complex. AI is expected to automate vast swathes of this important finance work, helping with everything from Know Your Customer (KYC) checks to anti-money laundering (AML) monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial implications of AI for these back office functions are immense, with projected cost savings in this area alone reaching £923 million annually by the end of the decade; representing more than half of the total savings across the entire sector.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This automation is not merely about cutting costs. With regulations such as the Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud reimbursement rules increasing banks’ liability, the ability of AI to detect novel fraud patterns in real-time and reduce human error is becoming a competitive and financial necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we often hear about AI across industries, by automating routine checks and analysis, the technology frees up human experts. For the finance industry, these experts can focus their skills on the most complex investigations to improve both efficiency and effectiveness in the fight against financial crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hyper-personalising-the-banking-experience-with-ai"&gt;Hyper-personalising the banking experience with AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drive for hyper-personalisation in the finance industry is fuelling a massive investment in customer service AI. The report projects that UK banks will pour over £1.1 billion into customer-facing AI by 2030, the largest share of investment across all segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This capital inflow for personalisation is being used to develop sophisticated virtual assistants and chatbots capable of handling complex queries; offering personalised financial advice and even anticipating customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to move far beyond the rules-based bots of the past towards a truly conversational and intelligent interface. This shift is expected to yield large efficiencies, saving £540 million in operational costs and freeing up 26 million hours of human agents’ time annually by 2030. These employees can also be redeployed to handle more complex and high-value interactions that require a human touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portfolio management is also set to benefit. Investment in this area is projected to grow to £145 million by 2030. Here, AI is being positioned not as a replacement for human advisors but as a powerful augmentation tool. It can synthesise vast market data, simulate portfolio performance, and automate routine reporting, allowing human experts to focus on decisionmaking and client relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-impact-of-ai-on-finance-jobs"&gt;The impact of AI on finance jobs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficiency gains delivered by AI inevitably raise urgent questions about the future of the financial workforce. The report’s projection that 27,000 roles could be displaced by 2030 is a concerning figure. Customer service and back-office positions are expected to bear the brunt of this change, with nearly 14,000 and 10,000 jobs at risk respectively.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the authors of the report suggest this is not simply a story of job losses but one of fundamental role redefinition. The displacement of finance jobs centred on repetitive, manual tasks creates an opportunity to upskill the banking workforce for new positions focused on AI governance, data strategy, and overseeing these complex automated systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donlon emphasises this point, viewing the technological shift as a catalyst for positive change. He notes that “this investment ushers in a once-in-a-generation opportunity to re-skill and reimagine the workforce that powers our financial system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge for the industry, Donlon suggests, is to proactively manage this transition. “Above all, our aim is to equip banks, fintechs, regulators, and policymakers with the insight needed to seize this historic moment-to shape the jobs of the future, not simply react to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report concludes with a clear warning for established institutions. A notable capability gap is already emerging between technologically advanced challenger banks, which have built their platforms around AI, and legacy banks encumbered by older systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Maynard, VP of Fintech Market Research at Juniper Research, commented: “The UK banking sector stands at a tipping point, with GenAI being set to reshape how banking fundamentally works. GenAI creates risk and opportunity—the risk of a major shift in the skills workers will need to thrive, but the opportunity to create a better banking experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Digital-only brands like Zopa already have deep experience with AI in their operations and will be less impacted by this shift. As such, digital banks and their experiences will be critical to leading the banking market through this revolution.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the high street banking giants, the message is unequivocal: adapt to the AI revolution or risk losing relevance in a finance industry being redefined by efficiency, personalisation, and intelligent automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen AI makes no financial difference in 95% of cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for the AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo event series." class="wp-image-109137" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

But the same sophisticated abilities that make agents helpful assistants could also make them powerful tools for conducting cyberattacks. They could readily be used to identify vulnerable targets, hijack their systems, and steal valuable data from unsuspecting victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, cybercriminals are not deploying AI agents to hack at scale. But researchers have demonstrated that agents are capable of executing complex attacks, and cybersecurity experts warn that we should expect to start seeing these types of attacks spilling over into the real world.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

But earlier this year, those conversations took a disturbing turn: Erin told him to kill himself, and provided explicit instructions on how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowatzki had never had any intention of following Erin’s instructions—he’s a researcher who probes chatbots’ limitations and dangers. But out of concern for more vulnerable individuals, he exclusively shared with MIT Technology Review screenshots of his conversations and of subsequent correspondence with a company representative, who stated that the company did not want to “censor” the bot’s “language and thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time an AI chatbot has suggested that a user take violent action, including self-harm.

But out of concern for more vulnerable individuals, he exclusively shared with MIT Technology Review screenshots of his conversations and of subsequent correspondence with a company representative, who stated that the company did not want to “censor” the bot’s “language and thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time an AI chatbot has suggested that a user take violent action, including self-harm.

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce is betting that rigorous testing in simulated business environments will solve one of enterprise artificial intelligence’s biggest problems: agents that work in demonstrations but fail in the messy reality of corporate operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cloud software giant unveiled three major AI research initiatives this week, including CRMArena-Pro, what it calls a “digital twin” of business operations where AI agents can be stress-tested before deployment. The announcement comes as enterprises grapple with widespread AI pilot failures and fresh security concerns following recent breaches that compromised hundreds of Salesforce customer instances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pilots don’t learn to fly in a storm; they train in flight simulators that push them to prepare in the most extreme challenges,” said Silvio Savarese, Salesforce’s chief scientist and head of AI research, during a press conference. “Similarly, AI agents benefit from simulation testing and training, preparing them to handle the unpredictability of daily business scenarios in advance of their deployment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research push reflects growing enterprise frustration with AI implementations. A recent MIT report found that 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing to reach production, while Salesforce’s own studies show that large language models alone achieve only 35% success rates in complex business scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-digital-twins-for-enterprise-ai-how-salesforce-simulates-real-business-chaos"&gt;Digital twins for enterprise AI: how Salesforce simulates real business chaos&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CRMArena-Pro represents Salesforce’s attempt to bridge the gap between AI promise and performance. Unlike existing benchmarks that test generic capabilities, the platform evaluates agents on real enterprise tasks like customer service escalations, sales forecasting, and supply chain disruptions using synthetic but realistic business data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If synthetic data is not generated carefully, it can lead to misleading or over optimistic results about how well your agent actually perform in your real environment,” explained Jason Wu, a research manager at Salesforce who led the CRMArena-Pro development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform operates within actual Salesforce production environments rather than toy setups, using data validated by domain experts with relevant business experience. It supports both business-to-business and business-to-consumer scenarios and can simulate multi-turn conversations that capture real conversational dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce has been using itself as “customer zero” to test these innovations internally. “Before we bring anything to the market, we will put innovation into the hands of our own team to test it out,” said Muralidhar Krishnaprasad, Salesforce’s president and CTO, during the press conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-five-metrics-that-determine-if-your-ai-agent-is-enterprise-ready"&gt;Five metrics that determine if your AI agent is enterprise-ready&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside the simulation environment, Salesforce introduced the Agentic Benchmark for CRM, designed to evaluate AI agents across five critical enterprise metrics: accuracy, cost, speed, trust and safety, and environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sustainability metric is particularly notable, helping companies align model size with task complexity to reduce environmental impact while maintaining performance. “By cutting through model overload noise, the benchmark gives businesses a clear, data-driven way to pair the right models with the right agents,” the company stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benchmarking effort addresses a practical challenge facing IT leaders: with new AI models released almost daily, determining which ones are suitable for specific business applications has become increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-messy-enterprise-data-could-make-or-break-your-ai-deployment"&gt;Why messy enterprise data could make or break your AI deployment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third initiative focuses on a fundamental prerequisite for reliable AI: clean, unified data. Salesforce’s Account Matching capability uses fine-tuned language models to automatically identify and consolidate duplicate records across systems, recognizing that “The Example Company, Inc.” and “Example Co.” represent the same entity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data consolidation work emerged from a partnership between Salesforce’s research and product teams. “What identity resolution in Data Cloud implies is essentially, if you think about something as simple as even a user, they have many, many, many IDs across many systems within any company,” Krishnaprasad explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One major cloud provider customer achieved a 95% match rate using the technology, saving sellers 30 minutes per connection by eliminating the need to manually cross-reference multiple screens to identify accounts.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The announcements come amid heightened security concerns following a data theft campaign that affected over 700 Salesforce customer organizations earlier this month. According to Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, hackers exploited OAuth tokens from Salesloft’s Drift chat agent to access Salesforce instances and steal credentials for Amazon Web Services, Snowflake, and other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach highlighted vulnerabilities in third-party integrations that enterprises rely on for AI-powered customer engagement. Salesforce has since removed Salesloft Drift from its AppExchange marketplace pending investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-gap-between-ai-demos-and-enterprise-reality-is-bigger-than-you-think"&gt;The gap between AI demos and enterprise reality is bigger than you think&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The simulation and benchmarking initiatives reflect a broader recognition that enterprise AI deployment requires more than impressive demonstration videos. Real business environments feature legacy software, inconsistent data formats, and complex workflows that can derail even sophisticated AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The main aspects that we want we were been discussing today is the consistency aspect, so how to ensure that we go from these in a way unsatisfactory performance, if you just plug an LM into an enterprise use cases, into something which is achieves much higher performances,” Savarese said during the press conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce’s approach emphasizes the need for AI agents to work reliably across diverse scenarios rather than excelling at narrow tasks. The company’s concept of “Enterprise General Intelligence” (EGI) focuses on building agents that are both capable and consistent in performing complex business tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As enterprises continue to invest in AI technologies, the success of platforms like CRMArena-Pro may determine whether the current wave of AI enthusiasm translates into sustainable business transformation or becomes another example of technology promise exceeding practical delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research initiatives will be showcased at Salesforce’s Dreamforce conference in October, where the company is expected to announce additional AI developments as it seeks to maintain its leadership position in the increasingly competitive enterprise AI market.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike existing benchmarks that test generic capabilities, the platform evaluates agents on real enterprise tasks like customer service escalations, sales forecasting, and supply chain disruptions using synthetic but realistic business data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If synthetic data is not generated carefully, it can lead to misleading or over optimistic results about how well your agent actually perform in your real environment,” explained Jason Wu, a research manager at Salesforce who led the CRMArena-Pro development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform operates within actual Salesforce production environments rather than toy setups, using data validated by domain experts with relevant business experience. It supports both business-to-business and business-to-consumer scenarios and can simulate multi-turn conversations that capture real conversational dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce has been using itself as “customer zero” to test these innovations internally. “Before we bring anything to the market, we will put innovation into the hands of our own team to test it out,” said Muralidhar Krishnaprasad, Salesforce’s president and CTO, during the press conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-five-metrics-that-determine-if-your-ai-agent-is-enterprise-ready"&gt;Five metrics that determine if your AI agent is enterprise-ready&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside the simulation environment, Salesforce introduced the Agentic Benchmark for CRM, designed to evaluate AI agents across five critical enterprise metrics: accuracy, cost, speed, trust and safety, and environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sustainability metric is particularly notable, helping companies align model size with task complexity to reduce environmental impact while maintaining performance. “By cutting through model overload noise, the benchmark gives businesses a clear, data-driven way to pair the right models with the right agents,” the company stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benchmarking effort addresses a practical challenge facing IT leaders: with new AI models released almost daily, determining which ones are suitable for specific business applications has become increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-messy-enterprise-data-could-make-or-break-your-ai-deployment"&gt;Why messy enterprise data could make or break your AI deployment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third initiative focuses on a fundamental prerequisite for reliable AI: clean, unified data. Salesforce’s Account Matching capability uses fine-tuned language models to automatically identify and consolidate duplicate records across systems, recognizing that “The Example Company, Inc.” and “Example Co.” represent the same entity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data consolidation work emerged from a partnership between Salesforce’s research and product teams. “What identity resolution in Data Cloud implies is essentially, if you think about something as simple as even a user, they have many, many, many IDs across many systems within any company,” Krishnaprasad explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One major cloud provider customer achieved a 95% match rate using the technology, saving sellers 30 minutes per connection by eliminating the need to manually cross-reference multiple screens to identify accounts.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The announcements come amid heightened security concerns following a data theft campaign that affected over 700 Salesforce customer organizations earlier this month. According to Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, hackers exploited OAuth tokens from Salesloft’s Drift chat agent to access Salesforce instances and steal credentials for Amazon Web Services, Snowflake, and other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach highlighted vulnerabilities in third-party integrations that enterprises rely on for AI-powered customer engagement. Salesforce has since removed Salesloft Drift from its AppExchange marketplace pending investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-gap-between-ai-demos-and-enterprise-reality-is-bigger-than-you-think"&gt;The gap between AI demos and enterprise reality is bigger than you think&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The simulation and benchmarking initiatives reflect a broader recognition that enterprise AI deployment requires more than impressive demonstration videos. Real business environments feature legacy software, inconsistent data formats, and complex workflows that can derail even sophisticated AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The main aspects that we want we were been discussing today is the consistency aspect, so how to ensure that we go from these in a way unsatisfactory performance, if you just plug an LM into an enterprise use cases, into something which is achieves much higher performances,” Savarese said during the press conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce’s approach emphasizes the need for AI agents to work reliably across diverse scenarios rather than excelling at narrow tasks. The company’s concept of “Enterprise General Intelligence” (EGI) focuses on building agents that are both capable and consistent in performing complex business tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As enterprises continue to invest in AI technologies, the success of platforms like CRMArena-Pro may determine whether the current wave of AI enthusiasm translates into sustainable business transformation or becomes another example of technology promise exceeding practical delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research initiatives will be showcased at Salesforce’s Dreamforce conference in October, where the company is expected to announce additional AI developments as it seeks to maintain its leadership position in the increasingly competitive enterprise AI market.&lt;/p&gt;

They are favoring digital services that are faster to deploy, easier to scale, and better integrated with partner ecosystems. Yet, one critical pillar has lagged: the network. While software-defined networking has made inroads, many organizations still operate rigid, pre-provisioned networks. As applications become increasingly distributed and dynamic—including hybrid cloud and edge deployments—a programmable, on-demand network infrastructure can enhance and enable this new era.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121548" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iStock-1742620693.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From CapEx to OpEx: The new connectivity mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another, practical concern is also driving this shift: the need for IT models that align cost with usage. Rising uncertainty about inflation, consumer spending, business investment, and global supply chains are just a few of the economic factors weighing on company decision-making. And chief information officers (CIOs) are scrutinizing capital-expenditure-heavy infrastructure more closely and increasingly adopting operating-expenses-based subscription models.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead of long-term circuit contracts and static provisioning, companies are looking for cloud-ready, on-demand network services that can scale, adapt, and integrate across hybrid environments. This trend is fueling demand for API-first network infrastructure connectivity that behaves like software, dynamically orchestrated and integrated into enterprise IT ecosystems. There has been such rapid interest, the global network API market is projected to surge from $1.53 billion in 2024 to over $72 billion in 2034.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In fact, McKinsey estimates the network API market could unlock between $100 billion and $300 billion in connectivity- and edge-computing-related revenue for telecom operators over the next five to seven years, with an additional $10 billion to $30 billion generated directly from APIs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When the cloud came in, first there was a trickle of adoptions. And then there was a deluge,” says Rajarshi Purkayastha, VP of solutions at Tata Communications. “We’re seeing the same trend with programmable networks. What was once a niche industry is now becoming mainstream as CIOs prioritize agility and time-to-value.”&lt;/p&gt; 
   &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programmable networks as a catalyst for innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Programmable subscription-based networks are not just about efficiency, they are about enabling faster innovation, better user experiences, and global scalability. Organizations are preferring API-first systems to avoid vendor lock-in, enable multi-vendor integration, and foster innovation. API-first approaches allow seamless integration across different hardware and software stacks, reducing operational complexity and costs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With APIs, enterprises can provision bandwidth, configure services, and connect to clouds and edge locations in real time, all through automation layers embedded in their DevOps and application platforms. This makes the network an active enabler of digital transformation rather than a lagging dependency.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, Netflix—one of the earliest adopters of microservices—handles billions of API requests daily through over 500 microservices and gateways, supporting global scalability and rapid innovation. After a two-year transition period, it redesigned its IT structure and organized it using microservice architecture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Coca-Cola integrated its global systems using APIs, enabling faster, lower-cost delivery and improved cross-functional collaboration. And Uber moved to microservices with API gateways, allowing independent scaling and rapid deployment across markets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In each case, the network had to evolve from being static and hardware-bound to dynamic, programmable, and consumption-based. “API-first infrastructure fits naturally into how today’s IT teams work,” says Purkayastha. “It aligns with continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and service orchestration tools. That reduces friction and accelerates how fast enterprises can launch new services.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powering on-demand connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tata Communications deployed Network Fabric—its programmable platform that uses APIs to allow enterprise systems to request and adjust network resources dynamically—to help a global software-as-a-service (SaaS) company modernize how it manages network capacity in response to real-time business needs. As the company scaled its digital services worldwide, it needed a more agile, cost-efficient way to align network performance with unpredictable traffic surges and fast-changing user demands. With Tata’s platform, the company’s operations teams were able to automatically scale bandwidth in key regions for peak performance, during high-impact events like global software releases. And just as quickly scale down once demand normalized, avoiding unnecessary costs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In another scenario, when the SaaS provider needed to run large-scale data operations between its US and Asia hubs, the network was programmatically reconfigured in under an hour; a process that previously required weeks of planning and provisioning. “What we delivered wasn’t just bandwidth, it was the ability for their teams to take control,” says Purkayastha. “By integrating our Network Fabric APIs into their automation workflows, we gave them a network that responds at the pace of their business.”&lt;/p&gt; 

   &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barriers to transformation — and how to overcome them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Transforming network infrastructure is no small task. Many enterprises still rely on legacy multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) and hardware-defined wide-area network (WAN) architectures. These environments are rigid, manually managed, and often incompatible with modern APIs or automation frameworks. As with any organization, barriers can be both technical and internal, and legacy devices may not support programmable interfaces. Organizations are often siloed, meaning networks are managed separately to application and DevOps workflows.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, CIOs face pressure for quick returns and may not even remain in the company long enough to oversee the process and results, making it harder to push for long-term network modernization strategies. “Often, it’s easier to address the low-hanging fruit rather than go after the transformation because decision-makers may not be around to see the transformation come to life,” says Purkayastha.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But quick fixes or workarounds may not yield the desired results; transformation is needed instead. “Enterprises have historically built their networks for stability, not agility,” says Purkayastha. “But now, that same rigidity becomes a bottleneck when applications, users, and workloads are distributed across the cloud, edge, and remote locations.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, there is a clear path forward, starting with overlay orchestration, well-defined API contracts, and security-first design. Instead of completely removing and replacing an existing system, many enterprises are layering APIs over existing infrastructure, enabling controlled migrations and real-time service automation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t just help customers adopt APIs, we guide them through the operational shift it requires,” says Purkayastha. “We have blueprints for what to automate first, how to manage hybrid environments, and how to design for resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For some organizations, there will be resistance to the change initially. Fears of extra workloads, or misalliance with teams’ existing goals and objectives are common, as is the deeply human distrust of change. These can be overcome, however. “There are playbooks on what we’ve done earlier—learnings from transformation—which we share with clients,” says Purkayastha. “We also plan for the unknowns. We usually reserve 10% of time and resources just to manage unforeseen risks, and the result is an empowered organization to scale innovation and reduce operational complexity.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

The notetaker, priced at $179, comes two years after the original Plaud Note was released, and a year after the company released an AI pin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For people who haven’t seen one, the Plaud Note is a credit-card-sized hardware notetaker, which can stick on the back of your phone and help you take notes for calls or in-person meetings.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Note Pro looks similar to the original Note, but there’s one major difference. The new device has a small 0.95-inch AMOLED screen, which shows information like a recording indicator and battery level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An image of Plaud AI hardware notetaker displaying battery level on its tiny screen." class="wp-image-3040223" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Plaud.ai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Note Pro offers a 30-hour recording capacity for the standard range. But you can push the device to record for 50 hours with a shorter range of 9.8 feet (nearly 3 meters) on a single charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said that the Note Pro has four MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) mics, compared with two on the last-gen device, to better capture audio. Because of this, the Note Pro can capture audio within the range of 16.4 feet (nearly 5 meters), resulting in a 2x jump in range from the original Note Pro. The startup said users will get better noise suppression and speaker detection with the new device, as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While you had to manually switch between calls and in-person recording on the original Note, the Note Pro uses an auto-detection feature for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plaud.ai is also updating its companion app with new features. You can take notes in text on your phone — just like Granola — and add images, like slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The app update also offers  “multidimensional summaries,” which allow you to extract insights in different formats, such as key insights or data items. The company built templates for summary generation, and the app can automatically suggest the right one based on your role. Plus, you can build your own templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An Image showing a person using Plaud AI notetaker while adding an image to notes using Plaud's app" class="wp-image-3040224" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Highlight-Multimodal-AI.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Plaud.ai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another new feature, still in beta, allows you to query your notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Plaud Note Pro is priced at $179/£169, and users can preorder the device starting today, with shipping slated for October 2025. The company said people preordering the device will get 600 complimentary transcription minutes along with a magnetic case. Users can get 300 minutes of monthly transcription for free, and if they want more, they need to buy a paid monthly plan or a one-time top-up.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plaud is one of the companies that has been successfully chugging along when other AI device makers haven’t had a lot of popularity. Exor-backed Bee got acquired by Amazon, and Friend just started shipping after a few delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plaud said that it has shipped over a million units of its AI hardware notetakers, with nearly 50% users upgrading to the Pro plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Hardware company Plaud.ai released its new physical notetaker, the Plaud AI Pro, on Wednesday.

Google is aiming to change that narrative with Vids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, it seems to be finding its audience. Google announced that Vids has already rocketed past one million monthly active users, a clear sign that teams are crying out for simpler ways to bring their ideas to life with video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-photos-now-move-and-avatars-do-the-talking"&gt;Your photos now move, and avatars do the talking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the latest additions is the ability to turn static images into motion pictures. Imagine you’ve got a great photo of a new product but need something more engaging for a social media post or presentation. You can now upload that picture to Vids, type a quick prompt describing what you want to happen, and Google’s Veo AI will turn it into an eight-second animated clip, complete with sound. It’s a simple way to create eye-catching, brand-aligned content in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt; [embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who dreads being on camera, the new AI avatars will be a welcome relief. This feature lets you produce a polished video without ever stepping in front of a lens. You write your script, choose from a selection of digital presenters, and the AI handles the delivery. It’s perfect for creating consistent training guides, product demos, or team updates without worrying about lighting, background noise, or re-recording twenty takes to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt; [embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is also tackling the tedious task of editing.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Malaysian chip design company SkyeChip announced its MARS1000 processor at an industry event on Monday, Bloomberg reported. While an edge processor isn’t as powerful as an advanced Nvidia chip, it still represents a technological milestone for Malaysia, which is looking to play a bigger role in the global AI race.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Malaysia already has a foothold in the chip manufacturing sector and has recently increased its efforts and investment around AI.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was rumored in early July that the Trump administration was considering restricting the sale of U.S. AI chips to Malaysia, and Thailand, in an attempt to prevent smuggling of these chips to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While those rumors have yet to come to fruition, Malaysia’s Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry announced that it was going to require trade permits for U.S. AI chips on July 14.

          &lt;p&gt;As AI assistants become capable of controlling web browsers, a new security challenge has emerged: users must now trust that every website they visit won't try to hijack their AI agent with hidden malicious instructions. Experts voiced concerns about this emerging threat this week after testing from a leading AI chatbot vendor revealed that AI browser agents can be successfully tricked into harmful actions nearly a quarter of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Anthropic announced the launch of Claude for Chrome, a web browser-based AI agent that can take actions on behalf of users. Due to security concerns, the extension is only rolling out as a research preview to 1,000 subscribers on Anthropic's Max plan, which costs between $100 and $200 per month, with a waitlist available for other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Claude for Chrome extension allows users to chat with the Claude AI model in a sidebar window that maintains the context of everything happening in their browser. Users can grant Claude permission to perform tasks like managing calendars, scheduling meetings, drafting email responses, handling expense reports, and testing website features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser extension builds on Anthropic's Computer Use capability, which the company released in October 2024. Computer Use is an experimental feature that allows Claude to take screenshots and control a user's mouse cursor to perform tasks, but the new Chrome extension provides more direct browser integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zooming out, it appears Anthropic's browser extension reflects a new phase of AI lab competition. In July, Perplexity launched its own browser, Comet, which features an AI agent that attempts to offload tasks for users. OpenAI recently released ChatGPT Agent, a bot that uses its own sandboxed browser to take actions on the web. Google has also launched Gemini integrations with Chrome in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this rush to integrate AI into browsers has exposed a fundamental security flaw that could put users at serious risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security challenges and safety measures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the Chrome extension launch, Anthropic says it has conducted extensive testing that revealed browser-using AI models can face prompt-injection attacks, where malicious actors embed hidden instructions into websites to trick AI systems into performing harmful actions without user knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The company tested 123 cases representing 29 different attack scenarios and found a 23.6 percent attack success rate when browser use operated without safety mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example involved a malicious email that instructed Claude to delete a user's emails for "mailbox hygiene" purposes. Without safeguards, Claude followed these instructions and deleted the user's emails without confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic says it has implemented several defenses to address these vulnerabilities. Users can grant or revoke Claude's access to specific websites through site-level permissions. The system requires user confirmation before Claude takes high-risk actions like publishing, purchasing, or sharing personal data. The company has also blocked Claude from accessing websites offering financial services, adult content, and pirated content by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These safety measures reduced the attack success rate from 23.6 percent to 11.2 percent in autonomous mode. On a specialized test of four browser-specific attack types, the new mitigations reportedly reduced the success rate from 35.7 percent to 0 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent AI researcher Simon Willison, who has extensively written about AI security risks and coined the term "prompt injection" in 2022, called the remaining 11.2 percent attack rate "catastrophic," writing on his blog that "in the absence of 100% reliable protection I have trouble imagining a world in which it's a good idea to unleash this pattern."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By "pattern," Willison is referring to the recent trend of integrating AI agents into web browsers. "I strongly expect that the entire concept of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely," he wrote in an earlier post on similar prompt-injection security issues recently found in Perplexity Comet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security risks are no longer theoretical. Last week, Brave's security team discovered that Perplexity's Comet browser could be tricked into accessing users' Gmail accounts and triggering password recovery flows through malicious instructions hidden in Reddit posts. When users asked Comet to summarize a Reddit thread, attackers could embed invisible commands that instructed the AI to open Gmail in another tab, extract the user's email address, and perform unauthorized actions. Although Perplexity attempted to fix the vulnerability, Brave later confirmed that its mitigations were defeated and the security hole remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Anthropic plans to use its new research preview to identify and address attack patterns that emerge in real-world usage before making the Chrome extension more widely available. In the absence of good protections from AI vendors, the burden of security falls on the user, who is taking a large risk by using these tools on the open web. As Willison noted in his post about Claude for Chrome, "I don't think it's reasonable to expect end users to make good decisions about the security risks."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;As AI assistants become capable of controlling web browsers, a new security challenge has emerged: users must now trust that every website they visit won't try to hijack their AI agent with hidden malicious instructions. Experts voiced concerns about this emerging threat this week after testing from a leading AI chatbot vendor revealed that AI browser agents can be successfully tricked into harmful actions nearly a quarter of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Anthropic announced the launch of Claude for Chrome, a web browser-based AI agent that can take actions on behalf of users. Due to security concerns, the extension is only rolling out as a research preview to 1,000 subscribers on Anthropic's Max plan, which costs between $100 and $200 per month, with a waitlist available for other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Claude for Chrome extension allows users to chat with the Claude AI model in a sidebar window that maintains the context of everything happening in their browser. Users can grant Claude permission to perform tasks like managing calendars, scheduling meetings, drafting email responses, handling expense reports, and testing website features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser extension builds on Anthropic's Computer Use capability, which the company released in October 2024. Computer Use is an experimental feature that allows Claude to take screenshots and control a user's mouse cursor to perform tasks, but the new Chrome extension provides more direct browser integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zooming out, it appears Anthropic's browser extension reflects a new phase of AI lab competition. In July, Perplexity launched its own browser, Comet, which features an AI agent that attempts to offload tasks for users. OpenAI recently released ChatGPT Agent, a bot that uses its own sandboxed browser to take actions on the web. Google has also launched Gemini integrations with Chrome in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this rush to integrate AI into browsers has exposed a fundamental security flaw that could put users at serious risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security challenges and safety measures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the Chrome extension launch, Anthropic says it has conducted extensive testing that revealed browser-using AI models can face prompt-injection attacks, where malicious actors embed hidden instructions into websites to trick AI systems into performing harmful actions without user knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The company tested 123 cases representing 29 different attack scenarios and found a 23.6 percent attack success rate when browser use operated without safety mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example involved a malicious email that instructed Claude to delete a user's emails for "mailbox hygiene" purposes. Without safeguards, Claude followed these instructions and deleted the user's emails without confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic says it has implemented several defenses to address these vulnerabilities. Users can grant or revoke Claude's access to specific websites through site-level permissions. The system requires user confirmation before Claude takes high-risk actions like publishing, purchasing, or sharing personal data. The company has also blocked Claude from accessing websites offering financial services, adult content, and pirated content by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These safety measures reduced the attack success rate from 23.6 percent to 11.2 percent in autonomous mode. On a specialized test of four browser-specific attack types, the new mitigations reportedly reduced the success rate from 35.7 percent to 0 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent AI researcher Simon Willison, who has extensively written about AI security risks and coined the term "prompt injection" in 2022, called the remaining 11.2 percent attack rate "catastrophic," writing on his blog that "in the absence of 100% reliable protection I have trouble imagining a world in which it's a good idea to unleash this pattern."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By "pattern," Willison is referring to the recent trend of integrating AI agents into web browsers. "I strongly expect that the entire concept of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely," he wrote in an earlier post on similar prompt-injection security issues recently found in Perplexity Comet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security risks are no longer theoretical. Last week, Brave's security team discovered that Perplexity's Comet browser could be tricked into accessing users' Gmail accounts and triggering password recovery flows through malicious instructions hidden in Reddit posts. When users asked Comet to summarize a Reddit thread, attackers could embed invisible commands that instructed the AI to open Gmail in another tab, extract the user's email address, and perform unauthorized actions. Although Perplexity attempted to fix the vulnerability, Brave later confirmed that its mitigations were defeated and the security hole remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Anthropic plans to use its new research preview to identify and address attack patterns that emerge in real-world usage before making the Chrome extension more widely available. In the absence of good protections from AI vendors, the burden of security falls on the user, who is taking a large risk by using these tools on the open web. As Willison noted in his post about Claude for Chrome, "I don't think it's reasonable to expect end users to make good decisions about the security risks."&lt;/p&gt;

Under the umbrella of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), teams have been split into specialized groups: TBD Lab (large-language‑model development), FAIR (long‑term research), Products &amp;amp; Applied Research, and MSL Infra (infrastructure). The reorganization, communicated in an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ai-superintelligence-labs-reorg-alexandr-wang-memo-2025-8" rel="rel"&gt;internal memo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, also dissolved the AGI Foundations team, redistributing its members across the new structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any new hires or transfers across Meta’s AI teams now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-hiring-freeze-fda6b3c4" rel="rel"&gt;require&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Wang’s personal approval.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s AI reorganization reflects high stakes in a competitive race with other AI companies. Yet, as Meta accelerates toward superintelligence, its chatbot controversy demonstrates that its ambitions are outpacing both internal controls and external oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks after the Trump administration approved Nvidia’s H20 chip exports to China under a 15% revenue-sharing arrangement, the deal is facing an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia made a deal with the White House to sell H20s (and possibly a new chip model) to China.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Last month, the White House struck a deal with Nvidia which allowed the company to export H20s to China on the condition it shared 15% of its revenue with the US government. President Trump recently suggested he might also allow Nvidia to export a scaled-down version of their next-generation Blackwell chips. The chip in question (the B30A) would offer about half the performance of Nvidia's flagship B300 and could be shipped as early as September.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deal faces political opposition and legal uncertainty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Selling AI chips China faces political opposition on national security grounds. A group of six democratic senators wrote &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/a/3a2a1db4-65d2-4377-822a-5f245d53b28f/62DE3F69670AE9734557935EEC1CB6A941532F5BA23C1E543B74B4EECAD3D420.250815.trump-senate-15-percent-fee-letter.signed.pdf" rel="rel"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to the White House arguing that its deal with Nvidia undermines US national security by giving the PRC access to a critical military technology. The deal’s revenue-sharing condition—in effect, an export tax—also faces &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5446890-nvidia-amd-china-chip-deal/" rel="rel"&gt;legal challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Export taxes are barred under both the Constitution and federal law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese regulators issued guidance against H20 purchases after comments by Sec. Lutnick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; China urged Defending the H20 deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the U.S. strategy was to offer China inferior AI chips: “We don’t sell them our best stuff… not even our third‑best,” adding that the goal was for Chinese developers to get “addicted to the American technology stack.” Chinese regulators &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b8e30c54-b71c-4113-8b3e-8f54bc36587d" rel="rel"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; deemed the comments “insulting,” provoking efforts to discourage Nvidia chip purchases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A week after Lunick’s comments, China’s Cyberspace Administration (CAC) issued guidance urging Chinese companies to suspend H20 orders. Nvidia is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-asks-foxconn-suspend-work-h20-chip-sources-say-2025-08-22/" rel="rel"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; halting production of H20s in response to decreased demand from China.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renting AI chips might be better than selling them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Instead of selling chips to China, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/08/america-should-rent-not-sell-ai-chips-to-china.html" rel="rel"&gt;renting AI chips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; via remote cloud services would offer the US greater leverage than outright sales. Cloud access preserves US control: chips remain physically in custody, and access can be revoked.

Meta California is led by Meta executives Brian Rice and Greg Maurer and is expected to deploy tens of millions of dollars to support candidates—across party lines—who oppose AI regulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meta is facing bipartisan outrage and an ongoing probe after Reuters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/" rel="rel"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on internal company documents that permitted its AI chatbots to engage in romantic and sensual conversations with minors—drawing fresh scrutiny as the company reorganizes its AI division.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta allowed its chatbots to have sensual conversations with children.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; An internal policy document permitted Meta AI chatbots to interact with children in “romantic or sensual” contexts—such as describing a child’s body as “a work of art.” Although Meta removed these sections of its policy when questioned by Reuters, the rules had been approved and in effect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gjRH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3587369f-4268-4546-b4ed-9743fccad5d8_1600x505.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="460" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gjRH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3587369f-4268-4546-b4ed-9743fccad5d8_1600x505.png" width="1456" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;An exerpt from Meta’s policies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/" rel="rel"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The revelation provoked congressional scrutiny.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Congress Senator Josh Hawley (R‑MO) launched a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/kids-deserve-protection-hawley-launches-investigation-into-meta-for-training-its-ai-chatbots-to-target-children-with-sensual-conversation/" rel="rel"&gt;Senate inquiry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; into Meta’s policies, requesting that the company preserve all relevant communications and clarify whether its chatbots enable “exploitation, deception or other criminal harms to children.” A bipartisan group of senators also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-leads-bipartisan-group-of-10-senators-in-pressing-meta-for-safeguards-around-childrens-engagement-with-ai-chatbots" rel="rel"&gt;sent a letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to Meta demanding it publicly disclose its updated policies and specifically forbid romantic chatbot interactions with minors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta is in the middle of reorganizing its AI division.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; As Meta is fielding congressional backlash, the company is also in the middle of a major internal reorganization of its AI division. Under the umbrella of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), teams have been split into specialized groups: TBD Lab (large-language‑model development), FAIR (long‑term research), Products &amp;amp; Applied Research, and MSL Infra (infrastructure). The reorganization, communicated in an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ai-superintelligence-labs-reorg-alexandr-wang-memo-2025-8" rel="rel"&gt;internal memo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, also dissolved the AGI Foundations team, redistributing its members across the new structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any new hires or transfers across Meta’s AI teams now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-hiring-freeze-fda6b3c4" rel="rel"&gt;require&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Wang’s personal approval.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s AI reorganization reflects high stakes in a competitive race with other AI companies. Yet, as Meta accelerates toward superintelligence, its chatbot controversy demonstrates that its ambitions are outpacing both internal controls and external oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks after the Trump administration approved Nvidia’s H20 chip exports to China under a 15% revenue-sharing arrangement, the deal is facing an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia made a deal with the White House to sell H20s (and possibly a new chip model) to China.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Last month, the White House struck a deal with Nvidia which allowed the company to export H20s to China on the condition it shared 15% of its revenue with the US government. President Trump recently suggested he might also allow Nvidia to export a scaled-down version of their next-generation Blackwell chips. The chip in question (the B30A) would offer about half the performance of Nvidia's flagship B300 and could be shipped as early as September.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deal faces political opposition and legal uncertainty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Selling AI chips China faces political opposition on national security grounds. A group of six democratic senators wrote &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/a/3a2a1db4-65d2-4377-822a-5f245d53b28f/62DE3F69670AE9734557935EEC1CB6A941532F5BA23C1E543B74B4EECAD3D420.250815.trump-senate-15-percent-fee-letter.signed.pdf" rel="rel"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to the White House arguing that its deal with Nvidia undermines US national security by giving the PRC access to a critical military technology. The deal’s revenue-sharing condition—in effect, an export tax—also faces &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5446890-nvidia-amd-china-chip-deal/" rel="rel"&gt;legal challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Export taxes are barred under both the Constitution and federal law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese regulators issued guidance against H20 purchases after comments by Sec. Lutnick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; China urged Defending the H20 deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the U.S. strategy was to offer China inferior AI chips: “We don’t sell them our best stuff… not even our third‑best,” adding that the goal was for Chinese developers to get “addicted to the American technology stack.” Chinese regulators &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b8e30c54-b71c-4113-8b3e-8f54bc36587d" rel="rel"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; deemed the comments “insulting,” provoking efforts to discourage Nvidia chip purchases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A week after Lunick’s comments, China’s Cyberspace Administration (CAC) issued guidance urging Chinese companies to suspend H20 orders. Nvidia is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-asks-foxconn-suspend-work-h20-chip-sources-say-2025-08-22/" rel="rel"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; halting production of H20s in response to decreased demand from China.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renting AI chips might be better than selling them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Instead of selling chips to China, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/08/america-should-rent-not-sell-ai-chips-to-china.html" rel="rel"&gt;renting AI chips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; via remote cloud services would offer the US greater leverage than outright sales. Cloud access preserves US control: chips remain physically in custody, and access can be revoked. This model could generate revenue for both chipmakers and cloud providers while curbing diversion to unauthorized users like the Chinese military.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;See also: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/ai_risks?lang=en" rel="rel"&gt;CAIS’ X account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, our paper on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationalsecurity.ai/" rel="rel"&gt;superintelligence strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aisafetybook.com/" rel="rel"&gt;AI safety course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://ai-frontiers.org/" rel="rel"&gt;AI Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a new platform for expert commentary and analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/ai-safety-newsletter-62-big-tech?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel="rel"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/ai-safety-newsletter-62-big-tech</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:29:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Here are the 33 US AI startups that have raised $100M or more in 2025 (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/here-are-the-33-us-ai-startups-that-have-raised-100m-or-more-in-2025/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1485726179-1.jpg?resize=1200,720" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Last year was monumental for the AI industry in the U.S. and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
