&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taki Allen, a student at Kenwood High School, told CNN affiliate WBAL, “I was just holding a Doritos bag — it was two hands and one finger out, and they said it looked like a gun.” But as a result, Allen said, “They made me get on my knees, put my hands behind my back, and cuffed me.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement shared with parents, Principal Katie Smith said the school’s security department had reviewed and canceled a gun detection alert, while Smith (who didn’t immediately realize the alert had been canceled) reported the situation to the school resource officer, who called the local police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Omnilert, the company that operates the AI gun detection system, told CNN, “We regret that this incident occurred and wish to convey our concern to the student and the wider community affected by the events that followed.” Nonetheless, Omnilert said “the process functioned as intended.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1225201409.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A high school student in Baltimore County, Maryland was reportedly handcuffed and searched after an AI security system flagged his bag of chips as a possible firearm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Such a tool could be used to add music to existing videos, or to add guitar accompaniment to an existing vocal track, sources said. It’s not clear when OpenAI plans to launch such a tool or whether it would be available as a standalone product (as opposed to integrating with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and video app Sora).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One source told The Information that OpenAI is working with some students from the Juilliard School to annotate scores as a way to provide training data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While OpenAI has launched generative music models in the past, they predate the launch of ChatGPT; more recently, the company has been developing audio models focused on text-to-speech and speech-to-text. Other companies with generative music models include Google and Suno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2021258442.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI is working on a new tool that would generate music based on text and audio prompts, according to a report in The Information.&lt;/p&gt;
