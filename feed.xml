    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Anthropic has added web and mobile interfaces for Claude Code, its immensely popular command-line interface (CLI) agentic AI coding tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web interface appears to be well-baked at launch, but the mobile version is limited to iOS and is in an earlier stage of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web version of Claude Code can be given access to a GitHub repository. Once that’s done, developers can give it general marching orders like “add real-time inventory tracking to the dashboard.” As with the CLI version, it gets to work, with updates along the way approximating where it’s at and what it’s doing. The web interface supports the recently implemented Claude Code capability to take suggestions or requested changes while it’s in the middle of working on a task. (Previously, if you saw it doing something wrong or missing something, you often had to cancel and start over.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can run multiple sessions at once and switch between them as needed; they’re listed in a left-side panel in the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside this web and mobile rollout, Anthropic has also introduced a new sandboxing runtime to Claude Code that, along with other things, aims to make the experience both more secure and lower friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Claude Code worked by asking permission before making most changes and steps along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;

      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Now, it can instead be given permissions for specific file system folders and network servers. That means fewer approval steps, but it’s also more secure overall against prompt injection and other risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Anthropic’s engineering blog, the new network isolation approach only allows Internet access “through a unix domain socket connected to a proxy server running outside the sandbox. … This proxy server enforces restrictions on the domains that a process can connect to, and handles user confirmation for newly requested domains.” Additionally, users can customize the proxy to set their own rules for outgoing traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, the coding agent can do things like fetch npm packages from approved sources, but without carte blanche for communicating with the outside world, and without badgering the user with constant approvals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many developers, these additions are more significant than the availability of web or mobile interfaces. They allow Claude Code agents to operate more independently without as many detailed, line-by-line approvals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s more convenient, but it’s a double-edged sword, as it will also make code review even more important. One of the strengths of the too-many-approvals approach was that it made sure developers were still looking closely at every little change. Now it might be a little bit easier to miss Claude Code making a bad call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new features are available in beta now as a research preview, and they are available to Claude users with Pro or Max subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

It was led by  Felicis and included a who’s who of angels and other top VCs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup began when Fedus had a conversation with&amp;nbsp;Cubuk (whose friends call him “Doge”) about seven months ago. Cubuk was one of Google Brain’s foremost machine learning and material science researchers.&amp;nbsp;After endless Silicon Valley takes on how generative AI would radically change scientific discovery, they decided that the pieces were finally in place to make this a reality. Or at least to found a startup that attempted it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There are a few things that happened in the LLM field, in experimental science and in simulations that kind of made this the right time,” Cubuk told TechCrunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For one, he said, robotic arms that could handle powder synthesis — the process of mixing and creating new materials — had recently proved themselves reliable.&amp;nbsp;For another, machine learning simulations had become efficient and accurate enough to model complex physical systems such as those needed to develop new materials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And, third, LLMs now had powerful reasoning capabilities&amp;nbsp;— in part through the work of Fedus and his team at OpenAI.&amp;nbsp;Fedus was one of the small team that created ChatGPT to begin with and was running OpenAI’s uber-important post-training team, which refines models after their initial development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Stitched together, the picture was clear: A simulation could theoretically discover new compounds, a robot could mix the materials, and an LLM could analyze the results and suggest course corrections. AI-automated material science was ready to be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, Cubuk was one of the researchers who published a groundbreaking paper in 2023 documenting a precursor Google research project. The team built a fully automated, robotic-powered lab and created 41 novel compounds from recipes suggested by language models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Equally importantly, the founders realized that even failed experiments would be valuable for their new startup because data is the lifeblood of AI. AI science offered an entirely new source for real-world training and post-training data. This&amp;nbsp;could, the founders believe, turn the existing scientific motivation system on its head, which seeks success, not exploration, rewarded via paper publication and grants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Making contact with reality, bringing experiments into the [AI] loop — we feel like this is the next frontier,” Fedus told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-felicis-wins-the-deal-openai-does-not-invest-nbsp"&gt;Felicis wins the deal; OpenAI does not invest&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After that discussion with Cubuk, Fedus went to the powers that be at OpenAI to share his resignation and his plan.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That investment didn’t actually materialize, however. OpenAI is not a backer of Periodic, the founders confirmed to TechCrunch. And while Fedus declined to say why, they actually didn’t need OpenAI’s money.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fedus’ tweet set off a frenzy of VCs courting the company. “There was almost like a feeling of being reverse pitched. One investor actually wrote a love letter to Periodic Labs,” Fedus laughed, explaining that neither he nor Cubuk “knew what to make of it.” Others sent multi-page documents pitching themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the first call that they actually took was from Peter Deng, a former OpenAI colleague turned investor for top-tier seed firm Felicis. (Deng left OpenAI for Felicis at the start of 2025.)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Liam is a very big deal within OpenAI, very well loved and an extremely impactful researcher,” Deng told TechCrunch. “When I heard he left, I texted him immediately.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Deng met Fedus for coffee in the Noe Valley neighborhood of San Francisco. Hyped on caffeine and enthusiasm, Fedus invited Deng to finish their conversation on a walk over the area’s famously hilly terrain. Pitch walks may be a Silicon Valley trope, but they also really happen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The chilly day had turned hot. Deng, wearing a sweater, sweated and scrambled to keep up with the fit and friendly Fedus until the founder said something that “literally stopped me in my tracks,” Deng told TechCrunch. He told Deng that “everyone talks about doing science, but in order to do science, you actually have to do science,” Deng recalls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In other words, they needed to give AI a fully equipped wet lab to try its ideas in a real-world, controlled setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The truth about these models is that everything that the models know is within normal distribution. We take a bunch of data, and it can just regurgitate what it knows,” Deng said. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Discovering something new has to involve testing hypotheses.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“And I committed on&amp;nbsp;the spot, in the middle of the hills of Noe Valley, to write the check,” Deng says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fedus also remembers&amp;nbsp;the moment&amp;nbsp;Deng asked how he could be involved, and Fedus told him the startup needed cash for laptops and a temporary office. And “he’s like, great, I’ll give you money right now. And it was just this huge vote of confidence.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Deng didn’t actually whip out his checkbook on the street. He went back to the office elated over the deal only to encounter Felicis’ lawyer, who pointed out that the firm couldn’t promptly sign a contract: The company wasn’t incorporated yet. It didn’t even have a name, much less a bank account to wire funds. “That’s how early we were.” Deng grinned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Soon they had all of those things and all the term sheets they could handle. With the $300 million war chest, Cubuk and Fedus hired over two dozen of the most prestigious AI and scientific talent like Alexandre Passos (a creator of o1 and o3); Eric Toberer (a materials scientist who has already made key superconductor discoveries); and Matt Horton, a creator of two of Microsoft’s GenAI materials science tools. And the list goes on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Because the team members are all experts in different areas, from AI to physics, each week one of them gives a grad-level lecture to the others. “We do feel like a tight coupling is extremely important,” Cubuk said. He wants everyone to understand all parts of what they are building.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Periodic Labs has already set up its lab, too, and is working with experimental data, simulations and testing some predictions. The main initial mission is to find new superconductor materials — potentially a gold mine discovery. Improved superconductors could power the next era of potent, but lower energy-consuming tech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the last part — the robots — are not yet up and running. “They will take a bit to train,”&amp;nbsp;Cubuk&amp;nbsp;said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All of this is, of course, a big swing for the fences. AI powered or not, scientific discovery is not typically fast, easy, or predictable. While this team of experts has some indications that they will find what they are looking for — or make other discoveries along the way (or simply generate valuable data on their failures), there’s no guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And we know that model makers themselves are inching their way toward more AI science. Last month, OpenAI VP Kevin Weil said he was launching an OpenAI for Science unit at the company to “build the next great scientific instrument: an AI-powered platform that accelerates scientific discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for the investor who wrote the love letter, he didn’t win the deal (although Fedus did say that the letter was “very flattering.”) The other seed investors include&amp;nbsp;Andreessen Horowitz, DST, Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Accel, and angel backers like Jeff Bezos, Elad Gil, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Dean.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elad Gil will be speaking about how AI has changed the startup landscape at Disrupt in San Francisco on October 29.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Periodic-Labs.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Periodic Labs, a new startup by one of OpenAI’s most respected researchers, Liam Fedus, and his former Google Brain colleague, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, came out of stealth last month with an enormous $300 million seed round. It was led by  Felicis and included a who’s who of angels and other top VCs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup began when Fedus had a conversation with&amp;nbsp;Cubuk (whose friends call him “Doge”) about seven months ago. Cubuk was one of Google Brain’s foremost machine learning and material science researchers.&amp;nbsp;After endless Silicon Valley takes on how generative AI would radically change scientific discovery, they decided that the pieces were finally in place to make this a reality. Or at least to found a startup that attempted it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There are a few things that happened in the LLM field, in experimental science and in simulations that kind of made this the right time,” Cubuk told TechCrunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For one, he said, robotic arms that could handle powder synthesis — the process of mixing and creating new materials — had recently proved themselves reliable.&amp;nbsp;For another, machine learning simulations had become efficient and accurate enough to model complex physical systems such as those needed to develop new materials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And, third, LLMs now had powerful reasoning capabilities&amp;nbsp;— in part through the work of Fedus and his team at OpenAI.&amp;nbsp;Fedus was one of the small team that created ChatGPT to begin with and was running OpenAI’s uber-important post-training team, which refines models after their initial development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Stitched together, the picture was clear: A simulation could theoretically discover new compounds, a robot could mix the materials, and an LLM could analyze the results and suggest course corrections. AI-automated material science was ready to be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, Cubuk was one of the researchers who published a groundbreaking paper in 2023 documenting a precursor Google research project. The team built a fully automated, robotic-powered lab and created 41 novel compounds from recipes suggested by language models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Equally importantly, the founders realized that even failed experiments would be valuable for their new startup because data is the lifeblood of AI. AI science offered an entirely new source for real-world training and post-training data. This&amp;nbsp;could, the founders believe, turn the existing scientific motivation system on its head, which seeks success, not exploration, rewarded via paper publication and grants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Making contact with reality, bringing experiments into the [AI] loop — we feel like this is the next frontier,” Fedus told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-felicis-wins-the-deal-openai-does-not-invest-nbsp"&gt;Felicis wins the deal; OpenAI does not invest&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After that discussion with Cubuk, Fedus went to the powers that be at OpenAI to share his resignation and his plan. He then gleefully tweeted to the world that he was leaving with what appeared to be OpenAI’s blessing and investment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Dubai-based startup, founded by ex-Careem operators Akeed Azmi&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;David Reche, has announced an oversubscribed $12 million Series A round led by European VC Picus Capital.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cercli today looks slightly different from the company that raised a $4 million seed round last year. It is rebuilding a Rippling-like stack for the MENA region, but making it AI-native from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the past year, that bet has paid off. The company says it has scaled revenue more than 10x and now processes over $100 million in payroll annually for multiple businesses across 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But in a crowded HR-tech market—where dozens of startups such as Deel and Remote, alongside incumbents like SAP and Oracle, already promise everything from cross-border payments to payroll — why does the market need another HR tech player? CEO Azmi hopes its AI-first rebuild may be the edge that sets it apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Azmi started Cercli to help enterprises with basic people operations, an issue he and Reche noticed at their previous employers, Careem and Kitopi, two of MENA’s best-known unicorns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With payroll spread across multiple systems and compliance varying by region, the first version of Cercli focused on a platform that consolidated human resources management, payroll, and compliance for MENA-based companies operating globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Azmi says it envisioned a bigger opportunity if it baked in AI. So, over the past three months, Azmi says the company has rewritten its entire payroll engine to be multi-country and agent-compatible, enabling it to scale more efficiently across global jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The legacy systems of the last 20 years—your SAPs, Oracles, Workdays—they were built for on-prem and the cloud. Now we’re entering an AI-native world,” Azmi said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We didn’t want to just integrate AI; we wanted to rethink the whole stack for how people and agents work together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s also done the same to its recruitment module. Cercli now offers agent-driven features that can surface candidate lists, source from internal datasets, and run background logic on hiring fit.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s own internal operations run on AI, as the company uses custom-built treasury and reconciliation agents to manage its own finances and accounting. That’s how the 14-person team closed its Series A while maintaining a 21% month-to-month revenue growth rate, according to Azmi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3059846" height="492" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2370.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Cercli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Cercli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond AI, the founder believes Cercli’s other strength lies in consolidation. Although plenty of multi-module HR competitors exist — including Deel, Rippling, BambooHR — MENA companies are often stitching their back office together from point solutions. A company might use different products for expense management, payroll or recruiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Customers are asking for everything in one place, and being AI-native allows us to build that unified experience far more quickly,” Azmi explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Azmi said Cercli’s AI-native architecture lets it onboard customers quickly, as well. Setup can occur in two to three days, compared to several months typical with legacy systems, he claims. This has helped the two-year-old HR-tech startup win clients from startups to multinationals, including Vision Bank, the Global Climate Finance Centre, Huspy, Lean Technologies, and Ziina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cercli is also the first MENA investment for Picus Capital. This firm has backed other global HR companies like Personio, Multiplier, Deel, Maki, and JetHR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other investors who participated in this Series A round include Knollwood Investment Advisory as well as existing investors Y Combinator, Afore Capital, and COTU Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the investment, the company plans to build new AI-native products and work on gaining more market share in the $5.8 billion HR software opportunity in MENA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve seen this business model succeed globally within our portfolio, and we are excited to back Cercli as they continue to grow market share through new customers and product launches,” said Robin Godenrath, founding partner at Picus Capital.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;In a region long defined by fragmented enterprise systems, outdated compliance tools, and HR software that rarely talks to finance, Cercli is building a unified alternative for MENA businesses with AI at its core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Dubai-based startup, founded by ex-Careem operators Akeed Azmi&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;David Reche, has announced an oversubscribed $12 million Series A round led by European VC Picus Capital.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cercli today looks slightly different from the company that raised a $4 million seed round last year. It is rebuilding a Rippling-like stack for the MENA region, but making it AI-native from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the past year, that bet has paid off. The company says it has scaled revenue more than 10x and now processes over $100 million in payroll annually for multiple businesses across 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But in a crowded HR-tech market—where dozens of startups such as Deel and Remote, alongside incumbents like SAP and Oracle, already promise everything from cross-border payments to payroll — why does the market need another HR tech player? CEO Azmi hopes its AI-first rebuild may be the edge that sets it apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Azmi started Cercli to help enterprises with basic people operations, an issue he and Reche noticed at their previous employers, Careem and Kitopi, two of MENA’s best-known unicorns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With payroll spread across multiple systems and compliance varying by region, the first version of Cercli focused on a platform that consolidated human resources management, payroll, and compliance for MENA-based companies operating globally.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Azmi says it envisioned a bigger opportunity if it baked in AI. So, over the past three months, Azmi says the company has rewritten its entire payroll engine to be multi-country and agent-compatible, enabling it to scale more efficiently across global jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The legacy systems of the last 20 years—your SAPs, Oracles, Workdays—they were built for on-prem and the cloud. Now we’re entering an AI-native world,” Azmi said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We didn’t want to just integrate AI; we wanted to rethink the whole stack for how people and agents work together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s also done the same to its recruitment module. Cercli now offers agent-driven features that can surface candidate lists, source from internal datasets, and run background logic on hiring fit.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s own internal operations run on AI, as the company uses custom-built treasury and reconciliation agents to manage its own finances and accounting. That’s how the 14-person team closed its Series A while maintaining a 21% month-to-month revenue growth rate, according to Azmi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond AI, the founder believes Cercli’s other strength lies in consolidation. Although plenty of multi-module HR competitors exist — including Deel, Rippling, BambooHR — MENA companies are often stitching their back office together from point solutions. A company might use different products for expense management, payroll or recruiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Customers are asking for everything in one place, and being AI-native allows us to build that unified experience far more quickly,” Azmi explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Azmi said Cercli’s AI-native architecture lets it onboard customers quickly, as well. Setup can occur in two to three days, compared to several months typical with legacy systems, he claims. This has helped the two-year-old HR-tech startup win clients from startups to multinationals, including Vision Bank, the Global Climate Finance Centre, Huspy, Lean Technologies, and Ziina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cercli is also the first MENA investment for Picus Capital. This firm has backed other global HR companies like Personio, Multiplier, Deel, Maki, and JetHR.&lt;/p&gt;
