&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new American pope’s namesake, Leo XIII, stood up for the rights of factory workers during the Gilded Age, a period in the 19th century of swift economic change and extreme wealth inequality led by corrupt industrial robber barons.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Speaking to a hall of cardinals last month, the pope said he would rely on 2,000 years of church social teaching to “respond to another industrial revolution and to innovations in the field of artificial intelligence that pose challenges to human dignity, justice, and labor,” reports The Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In attempts to shape Rome’s dialogue on AI and, by association, influence governments and policymakers, leaders of Google, Microsoft, Cisco and other tech giants have flown to the Vatican to preach the good word of emerging technologies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We are living through a crisis of disempowerment. Children are more anxious than ever; the former US surgeon general described a loneliness epidemic; people are increasingly worried about AI eroding education. The beautiful devices we use have been correlated with many of these trends.

Hardware is having a renaissance. Every major tech company is investing in physical interfaces for AI. Startups are raising capital to build robots, glasses, wearables that are going to track our every move. The form factor of AI is the next battlefield. Do we really want our future mediated entirely through interfaces we can’t open, code we can’t see, and decisions we can’t influence?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Because away from the self-centeredness of Silicon Valley, a quiet, grounded sense of resistance is reactivating. I’m calling it the revenge of the makers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2007, as the iPhone emerged, the maker movement was taking shape. This subculture advocates for learning-through-making in social environments like hackerspaces and libraries. DIY and open hardware enthusiasts gathered in person at Maker Faires—large events where people of all ages tinkered and shared their inventions in 3D printing, robotics, electronics, and more. Motivated by fun, self-fulfillment, and shared learning, the movement birthed companies like MakerBot, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and (my own education startup) littleBits from garages and kitchen tables. I myself wanted to challenge the notion that technology had to be intimidating or inaccessible, creating modular electronic building blocks designed to put the power of invention in the hands of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By definition, the maker movement is humble and it is consistent. Makers do not believe in the cult of individual genius; we believe in collective genius. We believe that creativity is universally distributed (not exclusively bestowed), that inventing is better together, and that we should make open products so people can observe, learn, and create—basically, the polar opposite of what Jony Ive and Sam Altman are building.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But over time, the momentum faded. The movement was dismissed by the tech and investment industry as niche and hobbyist, and starting in 2018, pressures on the hardware venture market (followed by covid) made people retreat from social spaces to spend more time behind screens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it’s mounting a powerful second act, joined by a wave of AI open-source enthusiasts. This time around the stakes are higher, and we need to give it the support it never had.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2024 the AI leader Hugging Face developed an open-source platform for AI robots, which already has 3,500+ robot data sets and draws thousands of participants from every continent to join giant hackathons. Raspberry Pi went public on the London Stock Exchange for $700 million. After a hiatus, Maker Faire came back; the most recent one had nearly 30,000 attendees, with kinetic sculptures, flaming octopuses, and DIY robot bands, and this year there will be over 100 Maker Faires around the world. Just last week, DIY.org relaunched its app. In March, my friend Roya Mahboob, founder of the Afghan Girls Robotics Team, released a movie about the team to incredible reviews. People love the idea that making is the ultimate form of human empowerment and expression. All the while, a core set of people have continued influencing millions through maker organizations like FabLabs and Adafruit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Studies show that hands-on creativity reduces anxiety, combats loneliness, and boosts cognitive function. The act of making grounds us, connects us to others, and reminds us that we are capable of shaping the world with our own hands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m not proposing to reject AI hardware but to reject the idea that innovation must be proprietary, elite, and closed. I’m proposing to fund and build the open alternative. That means putting our investment, time, and purchases towards robot built in community labs, AI models trained in the open, tools made transparent and hackable. That world isn’t just more inclusive—it’s more innovative. It’s also more fun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;This is not nostalgia. This is about fighting for the kind of future we want: A future of openness and joy, not of conformity and consumption. One where technology invites participation, not passivity. Where children grow up not just knowing how to swipe, but how to build. Where creativity is a shared endeavor, not the mythical province of lone geniuses in glass towers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his Io announcement video, Altman said, “We are literally on the brink of a new generation of technology that can make us our better selves.” It reminded me of the movie &lt;em&gt;Mountainhead&lt;/em&gt;, where four tech moguls tell themselves they are saving the world while the world is burning. I don’t think the iPhone made us our better selves. In fact, you’ve never seen me run faster than when I’m trying to snatch an iPhone out of my three-year-old’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So yes, I’m watching what Sam Altman and Jony Ive will unveil. But I’m far more excited by what’s happening in basements, in classrooms, on workbenches. Because the real iPhone moment isn’t a new product we wait for.

She’d turn them off; he’d get angry. By the time their third child turned seven, Gioia and her husband had divorced, but he still found ways to monitor her behavior. One Christmas, he gave their youngest a smartwatch. Gioia showed it to a tech-savvy friend, who found that the watch had a tracking feature turned on. It could be turned off only by the watch’s owner—her ex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What am I supposed to tell my daughter?” says Gioia, who is going by a pseudonym in this story out of safety concerns. “She’s so excited but doesn’t realize [it’s] a monitoring device for him to see where we are.” In the end, she decided not to confiscate the watch. Instead, she told her daughter to leave it at home whenever they went out together, saying that this way it wouldn’t get lost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gioia says she has informed a family court of this and many other instances in which her ex has used or appeared to use technology to stalk her, but so far this hasn’t helped her get full custody of her children. The court’s failure to recognize these tech-facilitated tactics for maintaining power and control has left her frustrated to the point where she yearns for visible bruises. “I wish he was breaking my arms and punching me in the face,” she says, “because then people could see it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People I spoke with for this article described combating tech-facilitated abuse as playing “whack-a-mole.” Just as you figure out how to alert people to smartphone location sharing, enter smart cars.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This sentiment is unfortunately common among people experiencing what’s become known as TFA, or tech-­facilitated abuse. Defined by the National Network to End Domestic Violence as “the use of digital tools, online platforms, or electronic devices to control, harass, monitor, or harm someone,” these often invisible or below-the-radar methods include using spyware and hidden cameras; sharing intimate images on social media without consent; logging into and draining a partner’s online bank account; and using device-based location tracking, as Gioia’s ex did with their daughter’s smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Because technology is so ubiquitous, TFA occurs in most cases of intimate partner violence. And those whose jobs entail protecting victims and survivors and holding abusive actors accountable struggle to get a handle on this multi­faceted problem. An Australian study from October 2024, which drew on in-depth interviews with victims and survivors of TFA, found a “considerable gap” in the understanding of TFA among frontline workers like police and victim service providers, with the result that police repeatedly dismissed TFA reports and failed to identify such incidents as examples of intimate partner violence. The study also identified a significant shortage of funding for specialists—that is, computer scientists skilled in conducting safety scans on the devices of people experiencing TFA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The dearth of understanding is particularly concerning because keeping up with the many faces of tech-facilitated abuse requires significant expertise and vigilance. As internet-connected cars and homes become more common and location tracking is increasingly normalized, novel opportunities are emerging to use technology to stalk and harass. In reporting this piece, I heard chilling tales of abusers who remotely locked partners in their own “smart homes,” sometimes turning up the heat for added torment. One woman who fled her abusive partner found an ominous message when she opened her Netflix account miles away: “Bitch I’m Watching You” spelled out where the names of the accounts’ users should be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the range of tactics, a 2022 survey of TFA-focused studies across a number of English-speaking countries found that the results readily map onto the Power and Control Wheel, a tool developed in Duluth, Minnesota, in the 1980s that categorizes the all-encompassing ways abusive partners exert power and control over victims: economically, emotionally, through threats, using children, and more. Michaela Rogers, the lead author of the study and a senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield in the UK, says she noted “paranoia, anxiety, depression, trauma and PTSD, low self-esteem … and self-harm” among TFA survivors in the wake of abuse that often pervaded every aspect of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This kind of abuse is taxing and tricky to resolve alone. Service providers and victim advocates strive to help, but many lack tech skills, and they can’t stop tech companies from bringing products to market. Some work with those companies to help create safeguards, but there are limits to what businesses can do to hold abusive actors accountable. To establish real guardrails and dole out serious consequences, robust legal frameworks are needed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s been slow work, but there have been concerted efforts to address TFA at each of these levels in the past couple of years. Some US states have passed laws against using smart car technology or location trackers such as Apple AirTags for stalking and harassment. Tech companies, including Apple and Meta, have hired people with experience in victim services to guide development of product safeguards, and advocates for victims and survivors are seeking out more specialized tech education.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the ever-evolving nature of technology makes it nearly impossible to create a permanent fix. People I spoke with for this article described the effort as playing “whack-a-mole.” Just as you figure out how to alert people to smartphone location sharing, enter smart cars. Outlaw AirTag stalking and a newer, more effective tool appears that can legally track your ex. That’s why groups that uniquely address TFA, like the Clinic to End Tech Abuse (CETA) at Cornell Tech in New York City, are working to create permanent infrastructure. A problem that has typically been seen as a side focus for service organizations can finally get the treatment it deserves as a ubiquitous and potentially life-endangering aspect of intimate partner violence. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Volunteer tech support&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CETA saw its first client seven years ago. In a small white room on Cornell Tech’s Roosevelt Island campus, two computer scientists sat down with someone whose abuser had been accessing the photos on their iPhone. The person didn’t know how this was happening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We worked with our client for about an hour and a half,” says one of the scientists, Thomas Ristenpart, “and realized it was probably an iCloud Family Sharing issue.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the time, CETA was one of just two clinics in the country created to address TFA (the other being the Technology Enabled Coercive Control Clinic in Seattle), and it remains on the cutting edge of the issue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Picture a Venn diagram, with one circle representing computer scientists and the other service providers for domestic violence victims. It’s practically two separate circles, with CETA occupying a thin overlapping slice. Tech experts are much more likely to be drawn to profitable companies or research institutions than social-work nonprofits, so it’s unexpected that a couple of academic researchers identified TFA as a problem and chose to dedicate their careers to combating it. Their work has won results, but the learning curve was steep.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;CETA grew out of an interest in measuring the “internet spyware software ecosystem” exploited in intimate partner violence, says Ristenpart. He and cofounder Nicola Dell initially figured they could help by building a tool that could scan phones for intrusive software. They quickly realized that this alone wouldn’t solve the problem—and could even compromise people’s safety if done carelessly, since it could alert abusers that their surveillance had been detected and was actively being thwarted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="close-up of a hand holding an Apple AirTag" class="wp-image-1118672" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/onur-binay-x8VQhw4xbRk-unsplash.jpg?w=1655" width="1655" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In December, Ohio passed a law making AirTag stalking a crime.

They conducted about 14 focus groups with professionals who worked daily with victims and survivors. They connected with organizations like the Anti-Violence Project and New York’s Family Justice Centers to get referrals. With the covid-19 pandemic, CETA went virtual and stayed that way. Its services now resemble “remote tech support,” Dell says. A handful of volunteers, many of whom work in Big Tech, receive clients’ intake information and guide them through processes for stopping unwanted location sharing, for example, on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Remote support has sufficed because abusers generally aren’t carrying out the type of sophisticated attack that can be foiled only by disassembling a device. “For the most part, people are using standard tools in the way that they were designed to be used,” says Dell. For example, someone might throw an AirTag into a stroller to keep track of its whereabouts (and those of the person pushing it), or act as the admin of a shared online bank account.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though CETA stands out as a tech-­centric service organization for survivors, anti-domestic-violence groups have been encountering and combating TFA for decades. When Cindy Southworth started her career in the domestic violence field in the 1990s, she heard of abusers doing rough location tracking using car odometers—the mileage could suggest, for instance, that a driver pretending to set out for the supermarket had instead left town to seek support. Later, when Southworth joined the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the advocacy community was looking at caller ID as “not only an incredibly powerful tool for survivors to be able to see who’s calling,” she recalls, “but also potentially a risky technology, if an abuser could see.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;As technology evolved, the ways abusers took advantage evolved too. Realizing that the advocacy community “was not up on tech,” Southworth founded the National Network to End Domestic Violence’s Safety Net Project in 2000 to provide a comprehensive training curriculum on how to “harness [technology] to help victims” and hold abusers accountable when they misuse it. Today, the project offers resources on its website, like tool kits that include guidance on strategies such as creating strong passwords and security questions. “When you’re in a relationship with someone,” explains director Audace Garnett, “they may know your mother’s maiden name.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Big Tech safeguards&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Southworth’s efforts later extended to advising tech companies on how to protect users who have experienced intimate partner violence. In 2020, she joined Facebook (now Meta) as its head of women’s safety. “What really drew me to Facebook was the work on intimate image abuse,” she says, noting that the company had come up with one of the first “sextortion” policies in 2012. Now she works on “reactive hashing,” which adds “digital fingerprints” to images that have been identified as nonconsensual so that survivors only need to report them once for all repeats to get blocked.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other areas of concern include “cyberflashing,” in which someone might share, say, unwanted explicit photos. Meta has worked to prevent that on Instagram by not allowing accounts to send images, videos, or voice notes unless they follow you. Besides that, though, many of Meta’s practices surrounding potential abuse appear to be more reactive than proactive. The company says it removes online threats that violate its policies against bullying and that promote “offline violence.” But earlier this year, Meta made its policies about speech on its platforms more permissive. Now users are allowed to refer to women as “household objects,” reported CNN, and to post transphobic and homophobic comments that had formerly been banned.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A key challenge is that the very same tech can be used for good or evil: A tracking function that’s dangerous for someone whose partner is using it to stalk them might help someone else stay abreast of a stalker’s whereabouts. When I asked sources what tech companies should be doing to mitigate technology-assisted abuse, researchers and lawyers alike tended to throw up their hands. One cited the problem of abusers using parental controls to monitor adults instead of children—tech companies won’t do away with those important features for keeping children safe, and there is only so much they can do to limit how customers use or misuse them. Safety Net’s Garnett said companies should design technology with safety in mind “from the get-go” but pointed out that in the case of many well-established products, it’s too late for that. A couple of computer scientists pointed to Apple as a company with especially effective security measures: Its closed ecosystem can block sneaky third-party apps and alert users when they’re being tracked. But these experts also acknowledged that none of these measures are foolproof.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Over roughly the past decade, major US-based tech companies including Google, Meta, Airbnb, Apple, and Amazon have launched safety advisory boards to address this conundrum. The strategies they have implemented vary. At Uber, board members share feedback on “potential blind spots” and have influenced the development of customizable safety tools, says Liz Dank, who leads work on women’s and personal safety at the company. One result of this collaboration is Uber’s PIN verification feature, in which riders have to give drivers a unique number assigned by the app in order for the ride to start. This ensures that they’re getting into the right car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s approach has included detailed guidance in the form of a 140-page “Personal Safety User Guide.” Under one heading, “I want to escape or am considering leaving a relationship that doesn’t feel safe,” it provides links to pages about blocking and evidence collection and “safety steps that include unwanted tracking alerts.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Creative abusers can bypass these sorts of precautions. Recently Elizabeth (for privacy, we’re using her first name only) found an AirTag her ex had hidden inside a wheel well of her car, attached to a magnet and wrapped in duct tape. Months after the AirTag debuted, Apple had received enough reports about unwanted tracking to introduce a security measure letting users who’d been alerted that an AirTag was following them locate the device via sound. “That’s why he’d wrapped it in duct tape,” says Elizabeth. “To muffle the sound.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Laws play catch-up&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If tech companies can’t police TFA, law enforcement should—but its responses vary. “I’ve seen police say to a victim, ‘You shouldn’t have given him the picture,’” says Lisa Fontes, a psychologist and an expert on coercive control, about cases where intimate images are shared nonconsensually. When people have brought police hidden “nanny cams” planted by their abusers, Fontes has heard responses along the lines of “You can’t prove he bought it [or] that he was actually spying on you. So there’s nothing we can do.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Places like the Queens Family Justice Center in New York City aim to remedy these law enforcement challenges. Navigating its mazelike halls, you can’t avoid bumping into a mix of attorneys, social workers, and case managers—which I did when executive director Susan Jacob showed me around after my visit to CETA. That’s by design. The center, one of more than 100 throughout the US, provides multiple services for those affected by gender-based and domestic violence. As I left, I passed a police officer escorting a man in handcuffs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CETA is in the process of moving its services here—and then to centers in the city’s other four boroughs. Having tech clinics at these centers will put the techies right next to lawyers who may be prosecuting cases. It’s tricky to prove the identity of people connected with anonymous forms of tech harassment like social media posts and spoofed phone calls, but the expert help could make it easier for lawyers to build cases for search warrants and protection orders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Law enforcement’s responses to allegations of tech-facilitated abuse vary. “I’ve seen police say to a victim, ‘You shouldn’t have given him the picture.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Lisa Fontes, psychologist and expert on coercive control&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lawyers pursuing cases with tech components don’t always have the legal framework to back them up. But laws in most US states do prohibit remote, covert tracking and the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, while laws relating to privacy invasion, computer crimes, and stalking might cover aspects of TFA. In December, Ohio passed a law making AirTag stalking a crime, and Florida is considering an amendment that would increase penalties for people who use tracking devices to “commit or facilitate commission of dangerous crimes.” But keeping up with evolving tech requires additional legal specificity. “Tech comes first,” explains Lindsey Song, associate program director of the Queens center’s family law project. “People use it well. Abusers figure out how to misuse it. The law and policy come way, way, way later.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;California is leading the charge in legislation addressing harassment via smart vehicles. Signed into law in September 2024, Senate Bill 1394 requires connected vehicles to notify users if someone has accessed their systems remotely and provide a way for drivers to stop that access. “Many lawmakers were shocked to learn how common this problem is,” says Akilah Weber Pierson, a state senator who coauthored the bill. “Once I explained how survivors were being stalked or controlled through features designed for convenience, there was a lot of support.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;At the federal level, the Safe Con­nections Act signed into law in 2022 requires mobile service providers to honor survivors’ requests to separate from abusers’ plans. As of 2024, the Federal Communications Commission has been examining how to incorporate smart-car-­facilitated abuse into the act’s purview. And in May, President Trump signed a bill prohibiting the online publication of sexually explicit images without consent. But there has been little progress on other fronts. The Tech Safety for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking Act would have authorized a pilot program, run by the Justice Department’s Office on Violence Against Women, to create as many as 15 TFA clinics for survivors. But since its introduction in the House of Representatives in November 2023, the bill has gone nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tech abuse isn’t about tech&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With changes happening so slowly at the legislative level, it remains largely up to folks on the ground to protect survivors from TFA. Rahul Chatterjee, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, has taken a particularly hands-on approach. In 2021, he founded the Madison Tech Clinic after working at CETA as a graduate student. He and his team are working on a physical tool that can detect hidden cameras and other monitoring devices. The aim is to use cheap hardware like Raspberry Pis and ESP32s to keep it affordable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chatterjee has come across products online that purport to provide such protection, like radio frequency monitors for the impossibly low price of $20 and red-light devices claiming to detect invisible cameras. But they’re “snake oil,” he says. “We test them in the lab, and they don’t work.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the Trump administration slashing academic funding, folks who run tech clinics have expressed concern about sustainability. Dell, at least, received $800,000 from the MacArthur Foundation in 2024, some of which she plans to put toward launching new CETA-like clinics. The tech clinic in Queens got some seed funding from CETA for its first year, but it is “actively seeking fundraising to continue the program,” says Jennifer Friedman, a lawyer with the nonprofit Sanctuary for Families, which is overseeing the clinic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these clinics expose all sorts of malicious applications of technology, the moral of this story isn’t that you should fear your tech. It’s that people who aim to cause harm will take advantage of whatever new tools are available.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“[TFA] is not about the technology—it’s about the abuse,” says Garnett. “With or without the technology, the harm can still happen.” Ultimately, the only way to stem gender-based and intimate partner violence is at a societal level, through thoughtful legislation, amply funded antiviolence programs, and academic research that makes clinics like CETA possible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, to protect themselves, survivors like Gioia make do with Band-Aid fixes. She bought her kids separate smartphones and sports gear to use at her house so her ex couldn’t slip tracking devices into the equipment he’d provided. “I’m paying extra,” she says, “so stuff isn’t going back and forth.” She got a new number and a new phone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Believe the people that [say this is happening to them],” she says, “because it’s going on, and it’s rampant.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jessica Klein is a Philadelphia-based freelance journalist covering intimate partner violence, cryptocurrency, and other topics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Gioia had her first child with her then husband, he installed baby monitors throughout their Massachusetts home—to “watch what we were doing,” she says, while he went to work. She’d turn them off; he’d get angry. By the time their third child turned seven, Gioia and her husband had divorced, but he still found ways to monitor her behavior. One Christmas, he gave their youngest a smartwatch. Gioia showed it to a tech-savvy friend, who found that the watch had a tracking feature turned on. It could be turned off only by the watch’s owner—her ex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What am I supposed to tell my daughter?” says Gioia, who is going by a pseudonym in this story out of safety concerns. “She’s so excited but doesn’t realize [it’s] a monitoring device for him to see where we are.” In the end, she decided not to confiscate the watch. Instead, she told her daughter to leave it at home whenever they went out together, saying that this way it wouldn’t get lost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gioia says she has informed a family court of this and many other instances in which her ex has used or appeared to use technology to stalk her, but so far this hasn’t helped her get full custody of her children. The court’s failure to recognize these tech-facilitated tactics for maintaining power and control has left her frustrated to the point where she yearns for visible bruises. “I wish he was breaking my arms and punching me in the face,” she says, “because then people could see it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People I spoke with for this article described combating tech-facilitated abuse as playing “whack-a-mole.” Just as you figure out how to alert people to smartphone location sharing, enter smart cars.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This sentiment is unfortunately common among people experiencing what’s become known as TFA, or tech-­facilitated abuse. Defined by the National Network to End Domestic Violence as “the use of digital tools, online platforms, or electronic devices to control, harass, monitor, or harm someone,” these often invisible or below-the-radar methods include using spyware and hidden cameras; sharing intimate images on social media without consent; logging into and draining a partner’s online bank account; and using device-based location tracking, as Gioia’s ex did with their daughter’s smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Because technology is so ubiquitous, TFA occurs in most cases of intimate partner violence. And those whose jobs entail protecting victims and survivors and holding abusive actors accountable struggle to get a handle on this multi­faceted problem. An Australian study from October 2024, which drew on in-depth interviews with victims and survivors of TFA, found a “considerable gap” in the understanding of TFA among frontline workers like police and victim service providers, with the result that police repeatedly dismissed TFA reports and failed to identify such incidents as examples of intimate partner violence. The study also identified a significant shortage of funding for specialists—that is, computer scientists skilled in conducting safety scans on the devices of people experiencing TFA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The dearth of understanding is particularly concerning because keeping up with the many faces of tech-facilitated abuse requires significant expertise and vigilance. As internet-connected cars and homes become more common and location tracking is increasingly normalized, novel opportunities are emerging to use technology to stalk and harass. In reporting this piece, I heard chilling tales of abusers who remotely locked partners in their own “smart homes,” sometimes turning up the heat for added torment. One woman who fled her abusive partner found an ominous message when she opened her Netflix account miles away: “Bitch I’m Watching You” spelled out where the names of the accounts’ users should be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the range of tactics, a 2022 survey of TFA-focused studies across a number of English-speaking countries found that the results readily map onto the Power and Control Wheel, a tool developed in Duluth, Minnesota, in the 1980s that categorizes the all-encompassing ways abusive partners exert power and control over victims: economically, emotionally, through threats, using children, and more. Michaela Rogers, the lead author of the study and a senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield in the UK, says she noted “paranoia, anxiety, depression, trauma and PTSD, low self-esteem … and self-harm” among TFA survivors in the wake of abuse that often pervaded every aspect of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This kind of abuse is taxing and tricky to resolve alone. Service providers and victim advocates strive to help, but many lack tech skills, and they can’t stop tech companies from bringing products to market. Some work with those companies to help create safeguards, but there are limits to what businesses can do to hold abusive actors accountable. To establish real guardrails and dole out serious consequences, robust legal frameworks are needed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s been slow work, but there have been concerted efforts to address TFA at each of these levels in the past couple of years. Some US states have passed laws against using smart car technology or location trackers such as Apple AirTags for stalking and harassment. Tech companies, including Apple and Meta, have hired people with experience in victim services to guide development of product safeguards, and advocates for victims and survivors are seeking out more specialized tech education.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the ever-evolving nature of technology makes it nearly impossible to create a permanent fix. People I spoke with for this article described the effort as playing “whack-a-mole.” Just as you figure out how to alert people to smartphone location sharing, enter smart cars. Outlaw AirTag stalking and a newer, more effective tool appears that can legally track your ex. That’s why groups that uniquely address TFA, like the Clinic to End Tech Abuse (CETA) at Cornell Tech in New York City, are working to create permanent infrastructure. A problem that has typically been seen as a side focus for service organizations can finally get the treatment it deserves as a ubiquitous and potentially life-endangering aspect of intimate partner violence. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Volunteer tech support&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CETA saw its first client seven years ago. In a small white room on Cornell Tech’s Roosevelt Island campus, two computer scientists sat down with someone whose abuser had been accessing the photos on their iPhone. The person didn’t know how this was happening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We worked with our client for about an hour and a half,” says one of the scientists, Thomas Ristenpart, “and realized it was probably an iCloud Family Sharing issue.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the time, CETA was one of just two clinics in the country created to address TFA (the other being the Technology Enabled Coercive Control Clinic in Seattle), and it remains on the cutting edge of the issue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Picture a Venn diagram, with one circle representing computer scientists and the other service providers for domestic violence victims. It’s practically two separate circles, with CETA occupying a thin overlapping slice. Tech experts are much more likely to be drawn to profitable companies or research institutions than social-work nonprofits, so it’s unexpected that a couple of academic researchers identified TFA as a problem and chose to dedicate their careers to combating it. Their work has won results, but the learning curve was steep.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;CETA grew out of an interest in measuring the “internet spyware software ecosystem” exploited in intimate partner violence, says Ristenpart. He and cofounder Nicola Dell initially figured they could help by building a tool that could scan phones for intrusive software. They quickly realized that this alone wouldn’t solve the problem—and could even compromise people’s safety if done carelessly, since it could alert abusers that their surveillance had been detected and was actively being thwarted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="close-up of a hand holding an Apple AirTag" class="wp-image-1118672" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/onur-binay-x8VQhw4xbRk-unsplash.jpg?w=1655" width="1655" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In December, Ohio passed a law making AirTag stalking a crime.

They conducted about 14 focus groups with professionals who worked daily with victims and survivors. They connected with organizations like the Anti-Violence Project and New York’s Family Justice Centers to get referrals. With the covid-19 pandemic, CETA went virtual and stayed that way. Its services now resemble “remote tech support,” Dell says. A handful of volunteers, many of whom work in Big Tech, receive clients’ intake information and guide them through processes for stopping unwanted location sharing, for example, on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Remote support has sufficed because abusers generally aren’t carrying out the type of sophisticated attack that can be foiled only by disassembling a device. “For the most part, people are using standard tools in the way that they were designed to be used,” says Dell. For example, someone might throw an AirTag into a stroller to keep track of its whereabouts (and those of the person pushing it), or act as the admin of a shared online bank account.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though CETA stands out as a tech-­centric service organization for survivors, anti-domestic-violence groups have been encountering and combating TFA for decades.

This ensures that they’re getting into the right car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s approach has included detailed guidance in the form of a 140-page “Personal Safety User Guide.” Under one heading, “I want to escape or am considering leaving a relationship that doesn’t feel safe,” it provides links to pages about blocking and evidence collection and “safety steps that include unwanted tracking alerts.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Creative abusers can bypass these sorts of precautions. Recently Elizabeth (for privacy, we’re using her first name only) found an AirTag her ex had hidden inside a wheel well of her car, attached to a magnet and wrapped in duct tape. Months after the AirTag debuted, Apple had received enough reports about unwanted tracking to introduce a security measure letting users who’d been alerted that an AirTag was following them locate the device via sound. “That’s why he’d wrapped it in duct tape,” says Elizabeth. “To muffle the sound.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Laws play catch-up&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If tech companies can’t police TFA, law enforcement should—but its responses vary. “I’ve seen police say to a victim, ‘You shouldn’t have given him the picture,’” says Lisa Fontes, a psychologist and an expert on coercive control, about cases where intimate images are shared nonconsensually. When people have brought police hidden “nanny cams” planted by their abusers, Fontes has heard responses along the lines of “You can’t prove he bought it [or] that he was actually spying on you. So there’s nothing we can do.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Places like the Queens Family Justice Center in New York City aim to remedy these law enforcement challenges. Navigating its mazelike halls, you can’t avoid bumping into a mix of attorneys, social workers, and case managers—which I did when executive director Susan Jacob showed me around after my visit to CETA. That’s by design. The center, one of more than 100 throughout the US, provides multiple services for those affected by gender-based and domestic violence. As I left, I passed a police officer escorting a man in handcuffs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CETA is in the process of moving its services here—and then to centers in the city’s other four boroughs. Having tech clinics at these centers will put the techies right next to lawyers who may be prosecuting cases. It’s tricky to prove the identity of people connected with anonymous forms of tech harassment like social media posts and spoofed phone calls, but the expert help could make it easier for lawyers to build cases for search warrants and protection orders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Law enforcement’s responses to allegations of tech-facilitated abuse vary. “I’ve seen police say to a victim, ‘You shouldn’t have given him the picture.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Lisa Fontes, psychologist and expert on coercive control&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lawyers pursuing cases with tech components don’t always have the legal framework to back them up. But laws in most US states do prohibit remote, covert tracking and the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, while laws relating to privacy invasion, computer crimes, and stalking might cover aspects of TFA. In December, Ohio passed a law making AirTag stalking a crime, and Florida is considering an amendment that would increase penalties for people who use tracking devices to “commit or facilitate commission of dangerous crimes.” But keeping up with evolving tech requires additional legal specificity. “Tech comes first,” explains Lindsey Song, associate program director of the Queens center’s family law project. “People use it well. Abusers figure out how to misuse it. The law and policy come way, way, way later.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;California is leading the charge in legislation addressing harassment via smart vehicles. Signed into law in September 2024, Senate Bill 1394 requires connected vehicles to notify users if someone has accessed their systems remotely and provide a way for drivers to stop that access. “Many lawmakers were shocked to learn how common this problem is,” says Akilah Weber Pierson, a state senator who coauthored the bill. “Once I explained how survivors were being stalked or controlled through features designed for convenience, there was a lot of support.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;At the federal level, the Safe Con­nections Act signed into law in 2022 requires mobile service providers to honor survivors’ requests to separate from abusers’ plans. As of 2024, the Federal Communications Commission has been examining how to incorporate smart-car-­facilitated abuse into the act’s purview. And in May, President Trump signed a bill prohibiting the online publication of sexually explicit images without consent. But there has been little progress on other fronts. The Tech Safety for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking Act would have authorized a pilot program, run by the Justice Department’s Office on Violence Against Women, to create as many as 15 TFA clinics for survivors. But since its introduction in the House of Representatives in November 2023, the bill has gone nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tech abuse isn’t about tech&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With changes happening so slowly at the legislative level, it remains largely up to folks on the ground to protect survivors from TFA. Rahul Chatterjee, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, has taken a particularly hands-on approach. In 2021, he founded the Madison Tech Clinic after working at CETA as a graduate student. He and his team are working on a physical tool that can detect hidden cameras and other monitoring devices. The aim is to use cheap hardware like Raspberry Pis and ESP32s to keep it affordable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chatterjee has come across products online that purport to provide such protection, like radio frequency monitors for the impossibly low price of $20 and red-light devices claiming to detect invisible cameras. But they’re “snake oil,” he says. “We test them in the lab, and they don’t work.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the Trump administration slashing academic funding, folks who run tech clinics have expressed concern about sustainability. Dell, at least, received $800,000 from the MacArthur Foundation in 2024, some of which she plans to put toward launching new CETA-like clinics. The tech clinic in Queens got some seed funding from CETA for its first year, but it is “actively seeking fundraising to continue the program,” says Jennifer Friedman, a lawyer with the nonprofit Sanctuary for Families, which is overseeing the clinic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these clinics expose all sorts of malicious applications of technology, the moral of this story isn’t that you should fear your tech. It’s that people who aim to cause harm will take advantage of whatever new tools are available.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“[TFA] is not about the technology—it’s about the abuse,” says Garnett. “With or without the technology, the harm can still happen.” Ultimately, the only way to stem gender-based and intimate partner violence is at a societal level, through thoughtful legislation, amply funded antiviolence programs, and academic research that makes clinics like CETA possible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, to protect themselves, survivors like Gioia make do with Band-Aid fixes. She bought her kids separate smartphones and sports gear to use at her house so her ex couldn’t slip tracking devices into the equipment he’d provided. “I’m paying extra,” she says, “so stuff isn’t going back and forth.” She got a new number and a new phone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Believe the people that [say this is happening to them],” she says, “because it’s going on, and it’s rampant.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jessica Klein is a Philadelphia-based freelance journalist covering intimate partner violence, cryptocurrency, and other topics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/18/1118235/big-tech-intimate-partner-violence/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Breaking bonds, breaking ground: Advancing the accuracy of computational chemistry with deep learning (Microsoft Research)</title><link>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/breaking-bonds-breaking-ground-advancing-the-accuracy-of-computational-chemistry-with-deep-learning/</link><description>&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt text: A dark blue, wavy surface with multiple colorful spheres placed on it.

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to share our first big milestone in solving a grand challenge that has hampered the predictive power of computational chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science for decades. By using a scalable deep-learning approach and generating an unprecedented quantity of diverse, highly accurate data, we have achieved a breakthrough in the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT), the workhorse method that thousands of scientists use every year to simulate matter at the atomistic level. Within the region of chemical space represented in our large training dataset, our model reaches the accuracy required to reliably predict experimental outcomes, as assessed on the well-known benchmark dataset W4-17&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;. This removes a fundamental barrier to shifting the balance of molecule and material design from being driven by laboratory experiments to being driven by computational simulations. The implications for accelerating scientific discovery are far reaching, spanning applications from drugs to batteries and green fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-dft"&gt;What is DFT?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Molecules and materials are made of atoms, which are held together by their electrons. These electrons act as a glue, determining the stability and properties of the chemical structure. Accurately computing the strength and properties of the electron glue is essential for predicting whether a chemical reaction will proceed, whether a candidate drug molecule will bind to its target protein, whether a material is suitable for carbon capture, or if a flow battery can be optimized for renewable energy storage. Unfortunately, a brute-force approach amounts to solving the many-electron Schrödinger equation, which requires computation that scales exponentially with the number of electrons. Considering that an atom has dozens of electrons, and that molecules and materials have large numbers of atoms, we could easily end up waiting the age of the universe to complete our computation unless we restrict our attention to small systems with only a few atoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DFT, introduced by Walter Kohn and collaborators in 1964-1965, was a true scientific breakthrough, earning Kohn the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998. DFT provides an extraordinary reduction in the computational cost of calculating the electron glue in an exact manner, from exponential to cubic, making it possible to perform calculations of practical value within seconds to hours.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-grand-challenge-in-dft"&gt;What is the grand challenge in DFT?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there is a catch: the exact reformulation has a small but crucial term—the exchange-correlation (XC) functional—which Kohn proved is universal (i.e., the same for all molecules and materials), but for which no explicit expression is known. For 60 years, people have designed practical approximations for the XC functional. The magazine &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; dubbed the gold rush to design better XC models the “pursuit of the Divine Functional&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;”. With time, these approximations have grown into a zoo of hundreds of different XC functionals from which users must choose, often using experimental data as a guide. Owing to the uniquely favorable computational cost of DFT, existing functionals have enabled scientists to gain extremely useful insight into a huge variety of chemical problems. However, the limited accuracy and scope of current XC functionals mean that DFT is still mostly used to interpret experimental results rather than predict them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-is-it-important-to-increase-the-accuracy-of-dft"&gt;Why is it important to increase the accuracy of DFT?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can contrast the present state of computational chemistry with the state of aircraft engineering and design. Thanks to predictive simulations, aeronautical engineers no longer need to build and test thousands of prototypes to identify one viable design. However, this is exactly what we currently must do in molecular and materials sciences. We send thousands of potential candidates to the lab, because the accuracy of the computational methods is not sufficient to &lt;em&gt;predict&lt;/em&gt; the experiments. To make a significant shift in the balance from laboratory to &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; experiments, we need to remove the fundamental bottleneck of the insufficient accuracy of present XC functionals. This amounts to bringing the error of DFT calculations with respect to experiments within &lt;em&gt;chemical accuracy&lt;/em&gt;, which is around 1 kcal/mol for most chemical processes. Present approximations typically have errors that are 3 to 30 times larger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-can-ai-make-a-difference"&gt;How can AI make a difference?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI can transform how we model molecules and materials with DFT by learning the XC functional directly from highly accurate data. The goal is to learn how the XC functional captures the complex relationship between its input, the electron density, and its output, the XC energy. You can think of the density like a glue, with regions of space where there is a lot of it and other regions with less of it. Traditionally, researchers have built XC functional approximations using the concept of the so-called &lt;em&gt;Jacob’s ladder&lt;/em&gt;: a hierarchy of increasingly complex, hand-designed descriptors of the electron density. Including density descriptors from higher rungs of this ladder aims to improve accuracy, but it comes at the price of increased computational cost. Even the few attempts that use machine learning have stayed within this traditional paradigm, thereby taking an approach that is akin to what people were doing in computer vision and speech recognition before the deep-learning era. Progress toward better accuracy has stagnated for at least two decades with this approach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our project is driven by the intuition that a true deep learning approach—where relevant representations of the electron density are learned directly from data in a computationally scalable way—has the potential to revolutionize the accuracy of DFT, much like deep learning has transformed other fields.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A significant challenge with going down this path, however, is that feature or representation learning is very data-hungry, and there is very little data around—too little to test this hypothesis reliably.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-have-we-done-in-this-milestone"&gt;What have we done in this milestone?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first step was generating data—a lot of it. This posed a major challenge, since the data must come from accurate solutions of the many-electron Schrödinger equation, which is precisely the prohibitively expensive problem that DFT is designed to replace. Fortunately, decades of progress in the scientific community have led to smarter, more efficient variants of brute-force methods, making it possible to compute reference data for &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; molecules at experimental accuracy. While these high-accuracy methods, also referred to as wavefunction methods, are far too costly for routine use in applications, we made a deliberate investment in them for this project. The reason? The upfront cost of generating high-quality training data is offset by the long-term benefit of enabling vast numbers of industrially relevant applications with cost effective DFT using the trained XC functional. Crucially, we rely on the ability of DFT—and our learned XC functional—to generalize from high-accuracy data for small systems to larger, more complex molecules.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are many different high-accuracy wavefunction methods, each tailored to different regions of chemical space. However, their use at scale is not well established, as they require extensive expertise—small methodological choices can significantly affect accuracy at the level that we target. We therefore joined forces with Prof. Amir Karton&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; from the University of New England, Australia, a world-leading expert who developed widely recognized benchmark datasets for a fundamental thermochemical property: atomization energy—the energy required to break all bonds in a molecule and separate it into individual atoms. To create a training dataset of atomization energies at unprecedented scale, our team at Microsoft built a scalable pipeline to produce highly diverse molecular structures. Using these structures and substantial Azure compute resources via Microsoft’s Accelerating Foundation Models Research program&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;, Prof. Karton applied a high-accuracy wavefunction method to compute the corresponding energy labels. The result is a dataset&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; two orders of magnitude larger than previous efforts. We are releasing a large part of this dataset&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; to the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data generation was only half of the challenge. We also needed to design a dedicated deep-learning architecture for the XC functional—one that is both computationally scalable and capable of learning meaningful representations from electron densities to accurately predict the XC energy. Our team of machine learning specialists, assisted by DFT experts, introduced a series of innovations that solve these and other challenges inherent to this complex learning problem. The result is &lt;strong&gt;Skala&lt;/strong&gt;, an XC functional that generalizes to unseen molecules, reaching the accuracy needed to predict experiments. This demonstrates for the first time that deep learning can truly disrupt DFT: reaching experimental accuracy does not require the computationally expensive hand-designed features of Jacob’s ladder. Instead, we can retain the original computational complexity of DFT while allowing the XC functional to learn how to extract meaningful features and predict accurate energies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="We compare the accuracy of Skala against the best existing functionals of varying computational cost. The prediction errors are evaluated on two well-known public benchmark datasets: the W4-17 dataset for atomization energies (y axis, mean absolute error) and the GMTKN55 dataset for general main-group chemistry (x axis, weighted total mean absolute deviation, or WTMAD-2 for short). Skala achieves near " class="wp-image-1142366" for="for" height="391" required="required" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DFT_combined-figure.png" width="1400" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;We compare the accuracy of Skala against the best existing functionals of varying computational cost. The prediction errors are evaluated on two well-known public benchmark datasets: the W4-17 dataset for atomization energies (y axis, mean absolute error) and the GMTKN55 dataset for general main-group chemistry (x axis, weighted total mean absolute deviation, or WTMAD-2 for short). Skala achieves near “chemical accuracy” (1 kcal/mol) on atomization energies. This is the accuracy required for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments, which, to date, no existing functional has reached. Skala works especially well on the “single reference” subset of this dataset, reaching a groundbreaking 0.85 kcal/mol. On the GMTKN55 dataset, Skala shows competitive accuracy to the best-performing hybrid functionals, at a lower cost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-spectrum is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Skala is a new density functional for the exchange-correlation energy that employs meta-GGA ingredients plus D3 dispersion and machine-learned nonlocal features of the electron density. Some exact constraints were imposed, and some others “emerge” from the fitting to about 150,000 accurate energy differences for sp molecules and atoms. Skala achieves high, hybrid-like accuracy on a large and diverse data set of properties of main group molecules, which has no overlap with its training set. The computational cost of Skala is higher than that of the r2SCAN meta-GGA for small molecules, but about the same for systems with 1,000 or more occupied orbitals. Its cost seems to be only 10% of the cost of standard hybrids and 1% of the cost of local hybrids. Developed by a Microsoft team of density functional theorists and deep-learning experts, Skala could be the first machine-learned density functional to compete with existing functionals for wide use in computational chemistry, and a sign of things to come in that and related fields. Skala learned from big data and was taught by insightful human scientists.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;— John P. Perdew, Professor of Physics, School of Science and Engineering, Tulane University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This first milestone was achieved for a challenging property in a specific region of chemical space—atomization energies of main group molecules—for which we generated our initial large batch of high-accuracy training data. Building on this foundation, we have started to expand our training dataset to cover a broader range of general chemistry, using our scalable in-house data generation pipeline. With the first small batch of training data beyond atomization energies, we have already extended the accuracy of our model, making it competitive with the best existing XC functionals across a wider spectrum of main group chemistry. This motivates us to continue growing our high-accuracy data generation campaign, engaging with external experts such as Prof. Amir Karton, who noted, “After years of benchmarking DFT methods against experimental accuracy, this is the first time I’ve witnessed such an unprecedented leap in the accuracy–cost trade-off. It is genuinely exciting to see how the creation of our new dataset has enabled these groundbreaking results — opening up a path for transformative advances across chemical, biochemical, and materials research.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-dft"&gt;What is DFT?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Molecules and materials are made of atoms, which are held together by their electrons. These electrons act as a glue, determining the stability and properties of the chemical structure. Accurately computing the strength and properties of the electron glue is essential for predicting whether a chemical reaction will proceed, whether a candidate drug molecule will bind to its target protein, whether a material is suitable for carbon capture, or if a flow battery can be optimized for renewable energy storage. Unfortunately, a brute-force approach amounts to solving the many-electron Schrödinger equation, which requires computation that scales exponentially with the number of electrons. Considering that an atom has dozens of electrons, and that molecules and materials have large numbers of atoms, we could easily end up waiting the age of the universe to complete our computation unless we restrict our attention to small systems with only a few atoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DFT, introduced by Walter Kohn and collaborators in 1964-1965, was a true scientific breakthrough, earning Kohn the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998. DFT provides an extraordinary reduction in the computational cost of calculating the electron glue in an exact manner, from exponential to cubic, making it possible to perform calculations of practical value within seconds to hours.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-grand-challenge-in-dft"&gt;What is the grand challenge in DFT?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there is a catch: the exact reformulation has a small but crucial term—the exchange-correlation (XC) functional—which Kohn proved is universal (i.e., the same for all molecules and materials), but for which no explicit expression is known. For 60 years, people have designed practical approximations for the XC functional. The magazine &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; dubbed the gold rush to design better XC models the “pursuit of the Divine Functional&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;”. With time, these approximations have grown into a zoo of hundreds of different XC functionals from which users must choose, often using experimental data as a guide. Owing to the uniquely favorable computational cost of DFT, existing functionals have enabled scientists to gain extremely useful insight into a huge variety of chemical problems. However, the limited accuracy and scope of current XC functionals mean that DFT is still mostly used to interpret experimental results rather than predict them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-is-it-important-to-increase-the-accuracy-of-dft"&gt;Why is it important to increase the accuracy of DFT?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can contrast the present state of computational chemistry with the state of aircraft engineering and design. Thanks to predictive simulations, aeronautical engineers no longer need to build and test thousands of prototypes to identify one viable design. However, this is exactly what we currently must do in molecular and materials sciences. We send thousands of potential candidates to the lab, because the accuracy of the computational methods is not sufficient to &lt;em&gt;predict&lt;/em&gt; the experiments. To make a significant shift in the balance from laboratory to &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; experiments, we need to remove the fundamental bottleneck of the insufficient accuracy of present XC functionals. This amounts to bringing the error of DFT calculations with respect to experiments within &lt;em&gt;chemical accuracy&lt;/em&gt;, which is around 1 kcal/mol for most chemical processes. Present approximations typically have errors that are 3 to 30 times larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-can-ai-make-a-difference"&gt;How can AI make a difference?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI can transform how we model molecules and materials with DFT by learning the XC functional directly from highly accurate data. The goal is to learn how the XC functional captures the complex relationship between its input, the electron density, and its output, the XC energy. You can think of the density like a glue, with regions of space where there is a lot of it and other regions with less of it. Traditionally, researchers have built XC functional approximations using the concept of the so-called &lt;em&gt;Jacob’s ladder&lt;/em&gt;: a hierarchy of increasingly complex, hand-designed descriptors of the electron density. Including density descriptors from higher rungs of this ladder aims to improve accuracy, but it comes at the price of increased computational cost. Even the few attempts that use machine learning have stayed within this traditional paradigm, thereby taking an approach that is akin to what people were doing in computer vision and speech recognition before the deep-learning era. Progress toward better accuracy has stagnated for at least two decades with this approach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our project is driven by the intuition that a true deep learning approach—where relevant representations of the electron density are learned directly from data in a computationally scalable way—has the potential to revolutionize the accuracy of DFT, much like deep learning has transformed other fields.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A significant challenge with going down this path, however, is that feature or representation learning is very data-hungry, and there is very little data around—too little to test this hypothesis reliably.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-have-we-done-in-this-milestone"&gt;What have we done in this milestone?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first step was generating data—a lot of it. This posed a major challenge, since the data must come from accurate solutions of the many-electron Schrödinger equation, which is precisely the prohibitively expensive problem that DFT is designed to replace. Fortunately, decades of progress in the scientific community have led to smarter, more efficient variants of brute-force methods, making it possible to compute reference data for &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; molecules at experimental accuracy. While these high-accuracy methods, also referred to as wavefunction methods, are far too costly for routine use in applications, we made a deliberate investment in them for this project. The reason? The upfront cost of generating high-quality training data is offset by the long-term benefit of enabling vast numbers of industrially relevant applications with cost effective DFT using the trained XC functional. Crucially, we rely on the ability of DFT—and our learned XC functional—to generalize from high-accuracy data for small systems to larger, more complex molecules.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are many different high-accuracy wavefunction methods, each tailored to different regions of chemical space. However, their use at scale is not well established, as they require extensive expertise—small methodological choices can significantly affect accuracy at the level that we target. We therefore joined forces with Prof. Amir Karton&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; from the University of New England, Australia, a world-leading expert who developed widely recognized benchmark datasets for a fundamental thermochemical property: atomization energy—the energy required to break all bonds in a molecule and separate it into individual atoms. To create a training dataset of atomization energies at unprecedented scale, our team at Microsoft built a scalable pipeline to produce highly diverse molecular structures. Using these structures and substantial Azure compute resources via Microsoft’s Accelerating Foundation Models Research program&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;, Prof. Karton applied a high-accuracy wavefunction method to compute the corresponding energy labels. The result is a dataset&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; two orders of magnitude larger than previous efforts. We are releasing a large part of this dataset&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; to the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data generation was only half of the challenge. We also needed to design a dedicated deep-learning architecture for the XC functional—one that is both computationally scalable and capable of learning meaningful representations from electron densities to accurately predict the XC energy. Our team of machine learning specialists, assisted by DFT experts, introduced a series of innovations that solve these and other challenges inherent to this complex learning problem. The result is &lt;strong&gt;Skala&lt;/strong&gt;, an XC functional that generalizes to unseen molecules, reaching the accuracy needed to predict experiments. This demonstrates for the first time that deep learning can truly disrupt DFT: reaching experimental accuracy does not require the computationally expensive hand-designed features of Jacob’s ladder. Instead, we can retain the original computational complexity of DFT while allowing the XC functional to learn how to extract meaningful features and predict accurate energies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="We compare the accuracy of Skala against the best existing functionals of varying computational cost.

Skala achieves near " class="wp-image-1142366" for="for" height="391" required="required" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DFT_combined-figure.png" width="1400" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;We compare the accuracy of Skala against the best existing functionals of varying computational cost. The prediction errors are evaluated on two well-known public benchmark datasets: the W4-17 dataset for atomization energies (y axis, mean absolute error) and the GMTKN55 dataset for general main-group chemistry (x axis, weighted total mean absolute deviation, or WTMAD-2 for short). Skala achieves near “chemical accuracy” (1 kcal/mol) on atomization energies. This is the accuracy required for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments, which, to date, no existing functional has reached. Skala works especially well on the “single reference” subset of this dataset, reaching a groundbreaking 0.85 kcal/mol. On the GMTKN55 dataset, Skala shows competitive accuracy to the best-performing hybrid functionals, at a lower cost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-spectrum is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Skala is a new density functional for the exchange-correlation energy that employs meta-GGA ingredients plus D3 dispersion and machine-learned nonlocal features of the electron density. Some exact constraints were imposed, and some others “emerge” from the fitting to about 150,000 accurate energy differences for sp molecules and atoms. Skala achieves high, hybrid-like accuracy on a large and diverse data set of properties of main group molecules, which has no overlap with its training set. The computational cost of Skala is higher than that of the r2SCAN meta-GGA for small molecules, but about the same for systems with 1,000 or more occupied orbitals. Its cost seems to be only 10% of the cost of standard hybrids and 1% of the cost of local hybrids. Developed by a Microsoft team of density functional theorists and deep-learning experts, Skala could be the first machine-learned density functional to compete with existing functionals for wide use in computational chemistry, and a sign of things to come in that and related fields. Skala learned from big data and was taught by insightful human scientists.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first milestone was achieved for a challenging property in a specific region of chemical space—atomization energies of main group molecules—for which we generated our initial large batch of high-accuracy training data. Building on this foundation, we have started to expand our training dataset to cover a broader range of general chemistry, using our scalable in-house data generation pipeline. With the first small batch of training data beyond atomization energies, we have already extended the accuracy of our model, making it competitive with the best existing XC functionals across a wider spectrum of main group chemistry. This motivates us to continue growing our high-accuracy data generation campaign, engaging with external experts such as Prof. Amir Karton, who noted, “After years of benchmarking DFT methods against experimental accuracy, this is the first time I’ve witnessed such an unprecedented leap in the accuracy–cost trade-off. It is genuinely exciting to see how the creation of our new dataset has enabled these groundbreaking results — opening up a path for transformative advances across chemical, biochemical, and materials research.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Former Cloudflare executive John Graham-Cumming recently announced that he launched a website, lowbackgroundsteel.ai, that treats pre-AI, human-created content like a precious commodity—a time capsule of organic creative expression from a time before machines joined the conversation. "The idea is to point to sources of text, images and video that were created prior to the explosion of AI-generated content," Graham-Cumming wrote on his blog last week. The reason? To preserve what made non-AI media uniquely human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archive name comes from a scientific phenomenon from the Cold War era. After nuclear weapons testing began in 1945, atmospheric radiation contaminated new steel production worldwide. For decades, scientists needing radiation-free metal for sensitive instruments had to salvage steel from pre-war shipwrecks. Scientists called this steel "low-background steel." Graham-Cumming sees a parallel with today's web, where AI-generated content increasingly mingles with human-created material and contaminates it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of generative AI models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion in 2022, it has become far more difficult for researchers to ensure that media found on the Internet was created by humans without using AI tools. ChatGPT in particular triggered an avalanche of AI-generated text across the web, forcing at least one research project to shut down entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That casualty was wordfreq, a Python library created by researcher Robyn Speer that tracked word frequency usage across more than 40 languages by analyzing millions of sources, including Wikipedia, movie subtitles, news articles, and social media. The tool was widely used by academics and developers to study how language evolves and to build natural language processing applications. The project announced in September 2024 that it will no longer be updated because "the Web at large is full of slop generated by large language models, written by no one to communicate nothing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers also worry about AI models training on their own outputs, potentially leading to quality degradation over time—a phenomenon sometimes called "model collapse." But recent evidence suggests this fear may be overblown under certain conditions. Research by Gerstgrasser et al. (2024) suggests that model collapse can be avoided when synthetic data accumulates alongside real data, rather than replacing it entirely. In fact, when properly curated and combined with real data, synthetic data from AI models can actually assist with training newer, more capable models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A time capsule of human expression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham-Cumming is no stranger to tech preservation efforts. He's a British software engineer and writer best known for creating POPFile, an open source email spam filtering program, and for successfully petitioning the UK government to apologize for its persecution of codebreaker Alan Turing—an apology that Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, his pre-AI website isn't new, but it has languished unannounced until now. "I created it back in March 2023 as a clearinghouse for online resources that hadn't been contaminated with AI-generated content," he wrote on his blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website points to several major archives of pre-AI content, including a Wikipedia dump from August 2022 (before ChatGPT's November 2022 release), Project Gutenberg's collection of public domain books, the Library of Congress photo archive, and GitHub's Arctic Code Vault—a snapshot of open source code buried in a former coal mine near the North Pole in February 2020. The wordfreq project appears on the list as well, flash-frozen from a time before AI contamination made its methodology untenable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site accepts submissions of other pre-AI content sources through its Tumblr page. Graham-Cumming emphasizes that the project aims to document human creativity from before the AI era, not to make a statement against AI itself. As atmospheric nuclear testing ended and background radiation returned to natural levels, low-background steel eventually became unnecessary for most uses. Whether pre-AI content will follow a similar trajectory remains a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it feels reasonable to protect sources of human creativity now, including archival ones, because these repositories&amp;nbsp;may become useful in ways that few appreciate at the moment. For example, in 2020, I proposed creating a so-called "cryptographic ark"—a timestamped archive of pre-AI media that future historians could verify as authentic, collected before my then-arbitrary cutoff date of January 1, 2022. AI slop pollutes more than the current discourse—it could cloud the historical record as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, lowbackgroundsteel.ai stands as a modest catalog of human expression from what may someday be seen as the last pre-AI era. It's a digital archaeology project marking the boundary between human-generated and hybrid human-AI cultures. In an age where distinguishing between human and machine output grows increasingly difficult, these archives may prove valuable for understanding how human communication evolved before AI entered the chat.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Former Cloudflare executive John Graham-Cumming recently announced that he launched a website, lowbackgroundsteel.ai, that treats pre-AI, human-created content like a precious commodity—a time capsule of organic creative expression from a time before machines joined the conversation. "The idea is to point to sources of text, images and video that were created prior to the explosion of AI-generated content," Graham-Cumming wrote on his blog last week. The reason? To preserve what made non-AI media uniquely human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archive name comes from a scientific phenomenon from the Cold War era. After nuclear weapons testing began in 1945, atmospheric radiation contaminated new steel production worldwide. For decades, scientists needing radiation-free metal for sensitive instruments had to salvage steel from pre-war shipwrecks. Scientists called this steel "low-background steel." Graham-Cumming sees a parallel with today's web, where AI-generated content increasingly mingles with human-created material and contaminates it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of generative AI models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion in 2022, it has become far more difficult for researchers to ensure that media found on the Internet was created by humans without using AI tools. ChatGPT in particular triggered an avalanche of AI-generated text across the web, forcing at least one research project to shut down entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That casualty was wordfreq, a Python library created by researcher Robyn Speer that tracked word frequency usage across more than 40 languages by analyzing millions of sources, including Wikipedia, movie subtitles, news articles, and social media. The tool was widely used by academics and developers to study how language evolves and to build natural language processing applications. The project announced in September 2024 that it will no longer be updated because "the Web at large is full of slop generated by large language models, written by no one to communicate nothing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers also worry about AI models training on their own outputs, potentially leading to quality degradation over time—a phenomenon sometimes called "model collapse." But recent evidence suggests this fear may be overblown under certain conditions. Research by Gerstgrasser et al. (2024) suggests that model collapse can be avoided when synthetic data accumulates alongside real data, rather than replacing it entirely. In fact, when properly curated and combined with real data, synthetic data from AI models can actually assist with training newer, more capable models.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;A time capsule of human expression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham-Cumming is no stranger to tech preservation efforts. He's a British software engineer and writer best known for creating POPFile, an open source email spam filtering program, and for successfully petitioning the UK government to apologize for its persecution of codebreaker Alan Turing—an apology that Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, his pre-AI website isn't new, but it has languished unannounced until now. "I created it back in March 2023 as a clearinghouse for online resources that hadn't been contaminated with AI-generated content," he wrote on his blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website points to several major archives of pre-AI content, including a Wikipedia dump from August 2022 (before ChatGPT's November 2022 release), Project Gutenberg's collection of public domain books, the Library of Congress photo archive, and GitHub's Arctic Code Vault—a snapshot of open source code buried in a former coal mine near the North Pole in February 2020. The wordfreq project appears on the list as well, flash-frozen from a time before AI contamination made its methodology untenable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site accepts submissions of other pre-AI content sources through its Tumblr page. Graham-Cumming emphasizes that the project aims to document human creativity from before the AI era, not to make a statement against AI itself. As atmospheric nuclear testing ended and background radiation returned to natural levels, low-background steel eventually became unnecessary for most uses. Whether pre-AI content will follow a similar trajectory remains a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it feels reasonable to protect sources of human creativity now, including archival ones, because these repositories&amp;nbsp;may become useful in ways that few appreciate at the moment. For example, in 2020, I proposed creating a so-called "cryptographic ark"—a timestamped archive of pre-AI media that future historians could verify as authentic, collected before my then-arbitrary cutoff date of January 1, 2022. AI slop pollutes more than the current discourse—it could cloud the historical record as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, lowbackgroundsteel.ai stands as a modest catalog of human expression from what may someday be seen as the last pre-AI era. It's a digital archaeology project marking the boundary between human-generated and hybrid human-AI cultures. In an age where distinguishing between human and machine output grows increasingly difficult, these archives may prove valuable for understanding how human communication evolved before AI entered the chat.&lt;/p&gt;
