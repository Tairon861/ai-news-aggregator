&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First outlined in the January 2025 budget speech by India’s finance minister, the ₹100 billion fund won cabinet approval this week (more than a year after the speech), allowing the government to move ahead with deployment. A previous iteration of the program, launched in 2016, committed ₹100 billion to 145 private funds that have invested more than ₹255 billion (about $2.8 billion) in over 1,370 startups, according to official data released on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The program is structured as a fund of funds, a common venture capital model in which governments back startups indirectly by committing capital to private investment firms. It is designed to take a more targeted approach than its 2016 counterpart, focusing on deep-tech and manufacturing startups that typically require longer time horizons and larger amounts of capital, while also backing early-stage founders, expanding investment beyond major cities and strengthening India’s domestic venture capital industry, particularly smaller funds, per the Indian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the announcement on Saturday, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw highlighted the scale of India’s startup expansion, pointing to figures shown on a presentation slide indicating the number of startups has grown from fewer than 500 in 2016 to more than 200,000 today. The slide said more than 49,000 startups were registered in 2025 alone, the highest annual total on record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The cabinet approval follows recent changes to India’s startup rules aimed at easing pressure on deep-tech companies. New Delhi doubled the period for which such firms are classified as startups to 20 years and raised the revenue threshold for startup-specific tax, grant and regulatory benefits to ₹3 billion, or about $33 million, up from ₹1 billion previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The approval comes just ahead of the government-backed India AI Impact Summit, where global AI companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia are set to participate alongside Indian corporates such as Reliance Industries and Tata Group. India, the world’s most populous country and one of its largest internet markets with more than a billion online users, has become an increasingly attractive arena for global tech companies looking to expand their user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, private capital has become harder to secure. India’s startup ecosystem raised $10.5 billion in 2025, down just over 17% from a year earlier, even as investors grew more selective and sharply reduced the number of deals. The number of funding rounds fell nearly 39% to 1,518 transactions, according to data from Tracxn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ByteDance, the Chinese company that recently finalized a deal to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations (it retains a stake in the new joint venture), launched Seedance 2.0 earlier this week.&amp;nbsp; According to the Wall Street Journal, the updated model is currently available to Chinese users of ByteDance’s Jianying app, and the company says it will soon be available to global users of its CapCut app.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similar to tools such as OpenAI’s Sora, Seedance allows users to create videos (currently limited to 15 seconds in length) by just entering a text prompt. And like Sora, Seedance quickly drew criticism for an apparent lack of guardrails around the ability to create videos using the likeness of real people, as well as studios’ intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After one X user posted a brief video showing Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt, which they said was created by “a 2 line prompt in seedance 2,” “Deadpool” screenwriter Rhett Reese responded, “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Motion Picture Association soon issued a statement from CEO Charles Rivkin demanding that ByteDance “immediately cease its infringing activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,” Rivkin said. “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Human Artistry Campaign — an initiative backed by Hollywood unions and trade groups — condemned Seedance 2.0 as “an attack one very creator around the world,” while the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA said it “stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement enabled by Bytedance’s new AI video model Seedance 2.0.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Seedance videos have apparently featured Disney-owned characters such as Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and Grogu, better known as Baby Yoda, prompting the company to take legal action. Axios reports that Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter accusing ByteDance of a “virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP”and claiming the Chinese company is “hijacking Disney’s characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring those characters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Disney isn’t necessarily opposed to working with AI companies — while it has reportedly sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google over similar issues, it’s signed a three-year licensing deal with OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

(AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/is-safety-is-dead-at-xai/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2207699717.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Elon Musk is “actively” working to make xAI’s Grok chatbot “more unhinged,” according to a former employee who spoke to The Verge about recent departures from Musk’s AI company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This week, following the announcement that Musk’s SpaceX is acquiring xAI (which previously acquired his social media company X), at least 11 engineers and two co-founders said they’re leaving the company. Some said they’re departing to start something new, and Musk himself suggested this is part of an effort to organize xAI more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But two sources who left the company (at least one of them before the current wave) reportedly told The Verge that employees have become increasingly disillusioned by the company’s disregard for safety, resulting in global scrutiny after Grok was used to create more than 1 million sexualized images, including deepfakes of real women and minors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One source said, “Safety is a dead org at xAI,” while the other said that Musk is “actively is trying to make the model more unhinged because safety means censorship, in a sense, to him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They also reportedly complained about a lack of direction, with one saying they felt xAI was “stuck in the catch-up phase” compared to competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
