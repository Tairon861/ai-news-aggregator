&lt;p&gt;At the FugakuNEXT International Initiative Launch Ceremony held in Tokyo on Aug. 22, leaders from RIKEN, Japan’s top research institute, announced the start of an international collaboration with Fujitsu and NVIDIA to co-design FugakuNEXT, the successor to the world-renowned supercomputer, Fugaku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awarded early in the process, the contract enables the partners to work side by side in shaping the system’s architecture to address Japan’s most critical research priorities — from earth systems modeling and disaster resilience to drug discovery and advanced manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than an upgrade, the effort will highlight Japan’s embrace of modern AI and showcase Japanese innovations that can be harnessed by researchers and enterprises across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ceremony featured remarks from the initiative’s leaders, RIKEN President Makoto Gonokami and Satoshi Matsuoka, director of the RIKEN Center for Computational Science and one of Japan’s most respected high-performance computing architects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fujitsu Chief Technology Officer Vivek Mahajan attended, emphasizing the company’s role in advancing Japan’s computing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing at NVIDIA, attended in person as well to discuss the collaborative design approach and how the resulting platform will serve as a foundation for innovation well into the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum has been building. When NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang touched down in Tokyo last year, he called on Japan to seize the moment — to put NVIDIA’s latest technologies to work building its own AI, on its own soil, with its own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FugakuNEXT answers that call, drawing on NVIDIA’s whole software stack —&amp;nbsp; from NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries such as NVIDIA cuQuantum for quantum simulation, RAPIDS for data science, NVIDIA TensorRT for high-performance inference and NVIDIA NeMo for large language model development, to other domain-specific software development kits tailored for science and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovations pioneered on FugakuNEXT could become blueprints for the world. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s Inside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FugakuNEXT will be a hybrid AI-HPC system, combining simulation and AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will feature FUJITSU-MONAKA-X CPUs, which can be paired with NVIDIA technologies using NVLink Fusion, new silicon enabling high-bandwidth connections between Fujitsu’s CPUs and NVIDIA’s architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system will be built for speed, scale and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What It Will Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FugakuNEXT will support a wide range of applications — such as automating hypothesis generation, code creation and experiment simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientific research: &lt;/b&gt;Accelerating simulations with surrogate models and physics-informed neural networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manufacturing:&lt;/b&gt; Using AI to learn from simulations to generate efficient and aesthetically pleasing designs faster than ever before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Earth systems modeling: &lt;/b&gt;aiding disaster preparedness and prediction for earthquakes and severe weather, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIKEN, Fujitsu and NVIDIA will collaborate on software developments, including tools for mixed-precision computing, continuous benchmarking, and performance optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FugakuNEXT isn’t just a technical upgrade — it’s a strategic investment in Japan’s future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by Japan’s MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), it will serve universities, government agencies, and industry partners nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It marks the start of a new era in Japanese supercomputing — one built on sovereign infrastructure, global collaboration, and a commitment to scientific leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in more meetings than usual today so I just caught up to the fact that &lt;strong&gt;Cohere, &lt;/strong&gt;the&lt;strong&gt; Canadian startup geared co-founded by former Transformer paper author Aidan Gomez &lt;/strong&gt;toward making generative AI products work easily, powerfully, and securely for enterprises, has &lt;strong&gt;released its first reasoning large language model (LLM), Command A Reasoning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks to be a strong release. Benchmarks, technical specs, and early tests suggest the model delivers on flexibility, efficiency, and raw reasoning power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer service, market research, scheduling, data analysis are some of the tasks Cohere says it’s built to handle automatically at scale inside&lt;strong&gt; secure enterprise environments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a text-only model, however, but it should be easy enough to hook up to multimodal models and tools. In fact, tool use is one of its primary selling points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s open for researchers to use for non-commercial purposes, enterprises will need to pay Cohere to get access and the company doesn’t publicly list its pricing because it says it makes bespoke customization and private deployment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cohere was valued at $6.8 billion&lt;/strong&gt; when it announced its latest funding round of $500 million a week and a day ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tuned-for-enterprises"&gt;Tuned for enterprises&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Command A Reasoning is tuned for enterprises with sprawling document libraries, long email chains, and workflows that can’t afford hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It supports up to &lt;strong&gt;256,000 tokens&lt;/strong&gt; on multi-GPU setups, a decent size and comparable to OpenAI’s GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research release weighs in at 111-billion parameters, trained with tool-use and multilingual performance in mind. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It supports 23 languages out of the box, including English, French, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, and Hindi.&lt;/strong&gt; That multilingual depth is key for global enterprises that need consistent agent quality across markets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model slots directly into &lt;em&gt;North&lt;/em&gt;, Cohere’s new platform for deploying AI agents and automations on-premises. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means enterprises can spin up custom agents that live entirely within their infrastructure, giving them control over data flows while still tapping into advanced reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cohere looks like it’s thought cleverly to identify some of the recurring functions across enterprises — onboarding, market research and analysis, development — and trained its model to support its agentic workflows for handling these automatically. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3015955" height="600" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2cf9ae44f8b085a95c125c4bcf4f33deeb1a0ddf-1128x1128-1.webp?w=600" width="600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-controlled-thinking"&gt;Controlled thinking&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with many other recent reasoning releases including Nvidia’s new Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Command A Reasoning introduces a token budget feature to let users or developers specify how much reasoning to allocate to specific inputs and tasks. Less budget means faster, cheaper replies. More budget means deeper, more accurate reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Hugging Face release even exposes this tradeoff directly: reasoning can be toggled on or off through a simple parameter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developers can run the model in “reasoning mode” for maximum performance or switch it off for lower latency tasks—without changing models.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-excels-at-enterprise-targeted-benchmarks"&gt;Excels at enterprise targeted benchmarks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So how does it perform in practice? Cohere’s benchmarks paint a clear picture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On enterprise reasoning tasks, &lt;strong&gt;Command A Reasoning consistently outpaces peers like DeepSeek-R1 0528, gpt-oss-120b, and Mistral Magistral Medium.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It handles multilingual benchmarks with equal strength, important for global businesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The token budget system isn’t just a gimmick. In head-to-head comparisons against Cohere’s previous &lt;em&gt;Command A&lt;/em&gt; model, satisfaction scores climbed steadily as the budget increased. Even with “instant” minimal reasoning, Command A Reasoning beat its predecessor. At higher budgets, it pulled further ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The story is the same in deep research. On the &lt;em&gt;DeepResearch Bench&lt;/em&gt;—which measures instruction following, readability, insight, and comprehensiveness—Cohere’s system came out on top against offerings from Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and xAI’s Grok. The model excelled in turning sprawling questions into reports that are not only detailed but readable, a key challenge in enterprise knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Beyond benchmarks, the model is wired for action. &lt;strong&gt;Cohere trained it specifically for conversational tool use — letting it call APIs, connect to databases, or query external systems during a task.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers can define tools via JSON schema and feed them into chat templates in Transformers, making it easier to integrate the model into existing enterprise systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That design supports Cohere’s larger bet on agentic workflows: AI systems made up of multiple coordinated agents, each handling a piece of a bigger job. Command A Reasoning is the reasoning engine that keeps those workflows coherent and on task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-safety-built-for-high-stakes-work"&gt;Safety: built for high-stakes work&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cohere is also pitching safety as a central feature. The model i&lt;strong&gt;s trained to avoid the common enterprise headache of over-refusal —&lt;/strong&gt; when an AI rejects legitimate requests out of caution — while &lt;strong&gt;still filtering harmful or malicious content. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evaluations&lt;strong&gt; focused on five high-risk categories: child safety, self-harm, violence and hate, explicit material, and conspiracy theories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For companies looking to deploy AI in regulated industries or sensitive domains, this balance is meant to make the model more practical in day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-buy-in-from-large-enterprises"&gt;Early buy-in from large enterprises&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SAP SE is one of the first major partners to integrate the model. Dr. Walter Sun, SVP and Global Head of AI, said the collaboration will enhance SAP’s generative AI capabilities within the SAP Business Technology Platform. For customers, that means agentic applications that can be customized to fit enterprise-specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-availability-and-licensing"&gt;Availability and licensing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Command A Reasoning is available now on the Cohere platform, and for research use on Hugging Face. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hugging Face repository provides open weights for research under a CC-BY-NC license, requiring users to share contact information and adhere to Cohere’s Acceptable Use Policy.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises interested in commercial or private deployments can contact Cohere’s sales team for bespoke pricing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, the pitch is straightforward: one model, multiple modes of deployment, fine-grained control over performance, multilingual capability, tool integration, and benchmark results that suggest it outperforms its peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cohere looks like it’s thought cleverly to identify some of the recurring functions across enterprises — onboarding, market research and analysis, development — and trained its model to support its agentic workflows for handling these automatically. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3015955" height="600" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2cf9ae44f8b085a95c125c4bcf4f33deeb1a0ddf-1128x1128-1.webp?w=600" width="600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-controlled-thinking"&gt;Controlled thinking&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with many other recent reasoning releases including Nvidia’s new Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Command A Reasoning introduces a token budget feature to let users or developers specify how much reasoning to allocate to specific inputs and tasks. Less budget means faster, cheaper replies. More budget means deeper, more accurate reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Hugging Face release even exposes this tradeoff directly: reasoning can be toggled on or off through a simple parameter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developers can run the model in “reasoning mode” for maximum performance or switch it off for lower latency tasks—without changing models.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-excels-at-enterprise-targeted-benchmarks"&gt;Excels at enterprise targeted benchmarks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So how does it perform in practice? Cohere’s benchmarks paint a clear picture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On enterprise reasoning tasks, &lt;strong&gt;Command A Reasoning consistently outpaces peers like DeepSeek-R1 0528, gpt-oss-120b, and Mistral Magistral Medium.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It handles multilingual benchmarks with equal strength, important for global businesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The token budget system isn’t just a gimmick. In head-to-head comparisons against Cohere’s previous &lt;em&gt;Command A&lt;/em&gt; model, satisfaction scores climbed steadily as the budget increased. Even with “instant” minimal reasoning, Command A Reasoning beat its predecessor. At higher budgets, it pulled further ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The story is the same in deep research. On the &lt;em&gt;DeepResearch Bench&lt;/em&gt;—which measures instruction following, readability, insight, and comprehensiveness—Cohere’s system came out on top against offerings from Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and xAI’s Grok. The model excelled in turning sprawling questions into reports that are not only detailed but readable, a key challenge in enterprise knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Beyond benchmarks, the model is wired for action. &lt;strong&gt;Cohere trained it specifically for conversational tool use — letting it call APIs, connect to databases, or query external systems during a task.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers can define tools via JSON schema and feed them into chat templates in Transformers, making it easier to integrate the model into existing enterprise systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That design supports Cohere’s larger bet on agentic workflows: AI systems made up of multiple coordinated agents, each handling a piece of a bigger job. Command A Reasoning is the reasoning engine that keeps those workflows coherent and on task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-safety-built-for-high-stakes-work"&gt;Safety: built for high-stakes work&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cohere is also pitching safety as a central feature. The model i&lt;strong&gt;s trained to avoid the common enterprise headache of over-refusal —&lt;/strong&gt; when an AI rejects legitimate requests out of caution — while &lt;strong&gt;still filtering harmful or malicious content. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evaluations&lt;strong&gt; focused on five high-risk categories: child safety, self-harm, violence and hate, explicit material, and conspiracy theories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For companies looking to deploy AI in regulated industries or sensitive domains, this balance is meant to make the model more practical in day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-buy-in-from-large-enterprises"&gt;Early buy-in from large enterprises&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SAP SE is one of the first major partners to integrate the model. Dr. Walter Sun, SVP and Global Head of AI, said the collaboration will enhance SAP’s generative AI capabilities within the SAP Business Technology Platform. For customers, that means agentic applications that can be customized to fit enterprise-specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-availability-and-licensing"&gt;Availability and licensing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Command A Reasoning is available now on the Cohere platform, and for research use on Hugging Face. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hugging Face repository provides open weights for research under a CC-BY-NC license, requiring users to share contact information and adhere to Cohere’s Acceptable Use Policy.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises interested in commercial or private deployments can contact Cohere’s sales team for bespoke pricing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, the pitch is straightforward: one model, multiple modes of deployment, fine-grained control over performance, multilingual capability, tool integration, and benchmark results that suggest it outperforms its peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Friday, the company said it would set up a local team in India and open a corporate office in the capital, New Delhi, in the coming months. The move builds on OpenAI’s recent hiring efforts in the region. In April 2024, the company appointed former Truecaller and Meta executive Pragya Misra as its public policy and partnerships lead in India. OpenAI also brought on former Twitter India head Rishi Jaitly as a senior advisor to help facilitate discussions with the Indian government on AI policy.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China — is a natural fit for OpenAI, which is competing with tech giants like Google and Meta, as well as AI upstarts like Perplexity, all looking to tap into the country’s massive user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said that it has started hiring a local team to “focus on strengthening relationships with local partners, governments, businesses, developers, and academic institutions.” It plans to get feedback from Indian users to make its products relevant for the local audience and even build features and tools specifically for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Opening our first office and building a local team is an important first step in our commitment to make advanced AI more accessible across the country and to build AI for India, and with India,” said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also announced it would host its first Education Summit in India this month and its first Developer Day in the country later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While India is clearly an essential market for OpenAI, the company faces key challenges — including how to convert free users into paying subscribers. Like other major AI players, it must navigate the monetization hurdle in a price-sensitive South Asian market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this week, the company introduced its sub-$5 ChatGPT plan called ChatGPT Go, priced at ₹399 per month (approximately $4.75), making it the first ChatGPT plan in India to attract the masses. This came just days after arch-rival Perplexity partnered with Indian telco giant Bharti Airtel to give Airtel’s more than 360 million subscribers access to Perplexity Pro for 12 months.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faces challenges in integrating with Indian businesses. In November, Indian news agency Asian News International (ANI) sued OpenAI for allegedly using its copyrighted news content without permission. A group of Indian publishers joined that case in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nonetheless, the Indian government is actively promoting AI across its departments and aims to strengthen the country’s position on the global AI map — momentum that OpenAI hopes to leverage.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“India has all the ingredients to become a global AI leader — amazing tech talent, a world-class developer ecosystem, and strong government support through the IndiaAI Mission,” Altman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India is not OpenAI’s first Asian office location. The company previously opened offices in markets including Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. OpenAI rival Anthropic also considered Japan a higher-priority market than India in the continent and recently set up its office in Tokyo rather than New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the reasons these AI companies do not prioritize India as an early market is the difficulty in securing enterprise customers, a Silicon Valley-based investor source recently told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“OpenAI’s decision to establish a presence in India reflects the country’s growing leadership in digital innovation and AI adoption,” said Indian IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, in a prepared statement. “As part of the IndiaAI Mission, we are building the ecosystem for trusted and inclusive AI, and we welcome OpenAI’s partnership in advancing this vision to ensure the benefits of AI reach every citizen.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/openai-india.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI has announced plans to open its first office in India, just days after launching a ChatGPT plan tailored for Indian users, as it looks to tap into the country’s rapidly growing AI market.&lt;/p&gt;

Once the police had “matches” to a few relatives of the killer, they built a large family tree from which they plucked the likely suspect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This process, called forensic investigative genetic genealogy, or FIGG, has since helped solve hundreds of murders and sexual assaults. Still, while the technology is potent, it’s incompletely realized. It operates via a mishmash of private labs and unregulated websites, like FamilyTree, which give users a choice to opt into or out of police searches. The number of profiles available for search by police hovers around 1.5 million, not yet enough to find matches in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To do my bit to increase those numbers, I traveled to Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The staff of the local district attorney, Anthony D. Gulluni, was giving away free FamilyTree tests at a minor-league hockey game in an effort to widen its DNA net and help solve several cold-case murders. After glancing over a consent form, I spit into a tube and handed it back. According to the promotional material from Gulluni’s office, I’d “become a hero.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I wasn’t really driven by some urge to capture distantly related serial killers.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather, my spit had a less gallant and more quarrelsome motive: to troll privacy advocates whose fears around DNA I think are overblown and unhelpful. By giving up my saliva for inspection, I was going against the view that a person’s DNA is the individualized, sacred text that privacy advocates sometimes claim.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the only reason FIGG works is that relatives share DNA: You share about 50% with a parent, 25% with a grandparent, about 12.5% with a first cousin, and so on. When I got my FamilyTree report back, my DNA had “matched” with 3,309 people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people are frightened by FIGG or reject its punitive aims.&lt;/strong&gt; One European genealogist I know says her DNA is kept private because she opposes the death penalty and doesn’t want to risk aiding US authorities in cases where lethal injection might be applied. But if enough people share their DNA, conscientious objectors won’t matter. Scientists estimate that a database including 2% of the US population, or 6 million people, could identify the source of nearly any crime-scene DNA, given how many distant relatives each of us has.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scholars of big data have termed this phenomenon “tyranny of the minority.” One person’s voluntary disclosure can end up exposing the same information about many others. And that tyranny can be abused.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA information held in private genealogy websites like FamilyTree is lightly guarded by terms of service. &lt;/strong&gt;These agreements have flip-flopped over time; at one point all users were included in law enforcement searches by default. Rules are easily ignored, too. Recent court filings indicate that the FBI, in its zeal to solve crimes, sometimes barges past restrictions to look for matches in databases whose policies exclude police.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Noble aims; no rules” is how one genetic genealogist described the overall situation in her field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My uncertainty grew the more questions I asked.&lt;/strong&gt; Who even controls my DNA file? That’s not easy to find out. FamilyTree is a brand operated by another company, Gene by Gene, which in 2021 was sold to a third company, MyDNA—ultimately owned by an Australian mogul whose name appears nowhere on its website. When I reached FamilyTree’s general manager, the genealogist Dave Vance, he told me that three-quarters of the profiles on the site were “opted in” to law enforcement searches.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One solution holds that the federal government should organize its own national DNA database for FIGG. But that would require new laws, new technical standards, and a debate about how our society wants to employ this type of big data—not just getting individual consent like mine. No such national project—or consensus—exists.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still ready to join a national crime-fighting database, but I regret doing it the way I did&lt;/strong&gt;—spitting in a tube on the sidelines of a hockey game and signing a consent form that affects not just me but all my thousands of genetic relatives. To them, I say: Whoops.

And that tyranny can be abused.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA information held in private genealogy websites like FamilyTree is lightly guarded by terms of service. &lt;/strong&gt;These agreements have flip-flopped over time; at one point all users were included in law enforcement searches by default. Rules are easily ignored, too. Recent court filings indicate that the FBI, in its zeal to solve crimes, sometimes barges past restrictions to look for matches in databases whose policies exclude police.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Noble aims; no rules” is how one genetic genealogist described the overall situation in her field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My uncertainty grew the more questions I asked.&lt;/strong&gt; Who even controls my DNA file? That’s not easy to find out. FamilyTree is a brand operated by another company, Gene by Gene, which in 2021 was sold to a third company, MyDNA—ultimately owned by an Australian mogul whose name appears nowhere on its website. When I reached FamilyTree’s general manager, the genealogist Dave Vance, he told me that three-quarters of the profiles on the site were “opted in” to law enforcement searches.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One solution holds that the federal government should organize its own national DNA database for FIGG. But that would require new laws, new technical standards, and a debate about how our society wants to employ this type of big data—not just getting individual consent like mine. No such national project—or consensus—exists.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still ready to join a national crime-fighting database, but I regret doing it the way I did&lt;/strong&gt;—spitting in a tube on the sidelines of a hockey game and signing a consent form that affects not just me but all my thousands of genetic relatives. To them, I say: Whoops. Your DNA; my bad.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

Space is the place. The final frontier. It is our human destiny to transcend our home world and expand our civilization to extraterrestrial vistas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This belief has been mainstream for decades, but its rise has been positively meteoric in this new gilded age of astropreneurs. Expanding humanity beyond Earth is both our birthright and our duty to the future, they insist. Failing to do so would consign our species to certain extinction—either by our own hand, perhaps through nuclear war or climate change, or in some cosmic disaster, like a massive asteroid impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as visions of giant orbital stations and Martian cities dance in our heads, a case against human space colonization has found its footing in a number of recent books. The argument grows from many grounds: Doubts about the practical feasibility of off-Earth communities. Concerns about the exorbitant costs, including who would bear them and who would profit. Realism about the harsh environment of space and the enormous tax it would exact on the human body. Suspicion of the underlying ideologies and mythologies that animate the race to settle space.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And, more bluntly, a recognition that “space sucks” and a lot of people have “underestimated the scale of suckitude,” as Kelly and Zach Weinersmith put it in their book &lt;em&gt;A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through?&lt;/em&gt;, which was released in paperback earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The Weinersmiths puncture the gauzy fantasy of space cities by asking pretty basic questions, like how to populate them. Astronauts experience all kinds of medical challenges in space, such as radiation exposure and bone loss, which would increase risks to both parents and babies. Nobody wants their pregnant “glow” to be a by-product of cosmic radiation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trying to bring forth babies in space “is going to be tricky business, not just in terms of science, but from the perspective of scientific ethics,” they write. “Adults can consent to being in experiments. Babies can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You don’t even have to contemplate going to Mars to make some version of this case. In &lt;em&gt;Ground Control: An Argument for the End of Human Space Exploration,&lt;/em&gt; Savannah Mandel chronicles how past and present generations have regarded human spaceflight as an affront to vulnerable children right here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of Ground Control" class="wp-image-1121785" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/book.control.jpg?w=858" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground Control: An Argument for the End of Human Space Exploration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Savannah Mandel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CHICAGO REVIEW PRESS, 2024&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hungry Kids Can’t Eat Moon Rocks,” read signs at a protest outside Kennedy Space Center on the eve of the Apollo 11 launch in July 1969. Gil Scott-Heron’s 1970 poem “Whitey on the Moon” rose to become the de facto anthem of this movement, which insists, to this day, that until humans get our earthly house in order, we have no business building new ones in outer space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ground Control,&lt;/em&gt; part memoir and part manifesto, channels this lament: How can we justify the enormous cost of sending people beyond our planet when there is so much suffering here at home?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Advocates for human space exploration reject the zero-sum framing and point to the many downstream benefits of human spaceflight. Space exploration has catalyzed inventions from the CAT scan to baby formula. There is also inherent value in our shared adventure of learning about the vast cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those upsides are real, but they are not remotely well distributed. Mandel predicts that the commercial space sector in its current form will only exacerbate inequalities on Earth, as profits from space ventures flow into the coffers of the already obscenely rich.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In her book, Mandel, a space anthropologist and scholar at Virginia Tech, describes a personal transformation from spacey dreamer to grounded critic. It began during fieldwork at Spaceport America, a commercial launch facility in New Mexico, where she began to see cracks in the dazzling future imagined by space billionaires. As her career took her from street protests in London to extravagant space industry banquets in Washington, DC, she writes, “crystal clear glasses” replaced “the rose-colored ones.”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Mandel remains enchanted by space but is skeptical that humans are the optimal trailblazers. Robots, rovers, probes, and other artificial space ambassadors could do the job for a fraction of the price and without risk to life, limb, and other corporeal vulnerabilities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A decentralization of self needs to occur,” she writes. “A dissolution of anthropocentrism, so to speak. And a recognition that future space explorers may not be man, even if man moves through them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, giant leaps for mankind no longer necessitate a man’s small steps; the wheels of a rover or the rotors of a copter offer a much better bang for our buck than boots on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Weinersmiths, Mandel devotes little attention to the physical dangers and limitations that space imposes on humans. She is more interested in a kind of psychic sickness that drives the impulse to abandon our planet and rush into new territories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a scholar of religion at Wesleyan University, presents a thorough diagnosis of this exact pathology in her 2022 book &lt;em&gt;Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race&lt;/em&gt;, which came out in paperback last year&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It all begins, appropriately enough, with the book of Genesis, where God creates Earth for the dominion of man. Over the years, this biblical brain worm has offered divine justification for the brutal colonization and environmental exploitation of our planet. Now it serves as the religious rocket fuel propelling humans into the next frontier, Rubenstein argues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of Astrotopia" class="wp-image-1121784" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/book.astrotopia.jpg?w=1241" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary-Jane Rubenstein&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS, 2022 &amp;nbsp;(PAPERBACK RELEASE 2024)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The intensifying ‘NewSpace race’ is as much a mythological project as it is a political, economic, or scientific one,” she writes. “It’s a mythology, in fact, that holds all these other efforts together, giving them an aura of duty, grandeur, and benevolence.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rubenstein makes a forceful case that malignant outgrowths of Christian ideas scaffold the dreams of space settlements championed by Musk, Bezos, and like-minded enthusiasts—even if these same people might never describe themselves as religious. If Earth is man’s dominion, space is the next logical step. Earth is just a temporary staging ground for a greater destiny; we will find our deliverance in the heavens.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Fuck Earth,” Elon Musk said in 2014. “Who cares about Earth? If we can establish a Mars colony, we can almost certainly colonize the whole solar system.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos, for one, claims to care about Earth; that’s among his best arguments for why humans should move beyond it. If heavy industries and large civilian populations cast off into the orbital expanse, our home world can be, in his words, “zoned residential and light industry,” allowing it to recover from anthropogenic pressures. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bezos also believes that space settlements are essential for the betterment of humanity, in part on the grounds that they will uncork our population growth. He envisions an orbital archipelago of stations, sprawled across the solar system, that could support a collective population of a trillion people. “That’s a thousand Mozarts. A thousand Einsteins,” Bezos has mused. “What a cool civilization that would be.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It does sound cool. But it’s an easy layup for Rubenstein: This “numbers game” approach would also produce a thousand Hitlers and Stalins, she writes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that is the real crux of the argument against pushing hard torapidly expand human civilization into space: We will still be humans when we get there. We won’t escape our vices and frailties by leaving Earth—in fact, we may exacerbate them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While all three books push back on the existential argument for space settlements, the Weinersmiths take the rebuttal one step further by proposing that space colonization might actually increase the risk of self-annihilation rather than neutralizing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Going to space will not end war because war isn’t caused by anything that space travel is apt to change, even in the most optimistic scenarios,” they write. “Humanity going to space en masse probably won’t reduce the likelihood of war, but we should consider that it might increase the chance of war being horrific.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The pair imagine rival space nations exchanging asteroid fire or poisoning whole biospheres. Proponents of space settlements often point to the fate of the dinosaurs as motivational grist, but what if a doomsday asteroid were deliberately flung between human cultures as a weapon? It may sound outlandish, but it’s no more speculative than a floating civilization with a thousand Mozarts. It follows the same logic of extrapolating our human future in space from our behavior on Earth in the past.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So should we just sit around and wait for our inevitable extinction? The three books have more or less the same response: What’s the rush? It is far more likely that humanity will be wiped out by our own activity in the near term than by any kind of cosmic threat. Worrying about the expansion of the sun in billions of years, as Musk has openly done, is frankly hysterical.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we have some growing up to do. Mandel and Rubenstein both argue that any worthy human future in space must adopt a decolonizing approach that emphasizes caretaking and stewardship of this planet and its inhabitants before we set off for others. They draw inspiration from science fiction, popular culture, and Indigenous knowledge, among other sources, to sketch out these alternative visions of an off-Earth future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mandel sees hope for this future in post-scarcity political theories. She cites various attempts to anticipate the needs of future generations—ideas found in the work of the social theorist Aaron Benanav, or in the values expressed by the Green New Deal, or in the fictional Ministry for the Future imagined by Kim Stanley Robinson in his 2020 novel of the same name. Whatever you think of the controversial 2025 book &lt;em&gt;Abundance&lt;/em&gt;, by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, it is also appealing to the same demand for a post-scarcity road map.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To that end, Mandel envisions “the creation of a governing body that would require that techno-scientific plans, especially those with a global reach, take into consideration multigenerational impacts and multigenerational voices.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Rubenstein, religion is the poison, but it may also offer the cure. She sees potential in a revival of pantheism, which is the belief that all the contents of the universe—from rocks to humans to galaxies—are divine and perhaps alive on some level. She hasn’t fully converted herself to this movement, let alone become an evangelist, but she says it’s a spiritual direction that could be an effective counterweight to dominionist views of the universe.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter whether … any sort of pantheism is ‘true,’” she writes. “What matters is the way any given mythology prompts us to interact with the world we’re a part of—the world each of our actions helps to make and unmake. And frankly, some mythologies prompt us to act better than others.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All these authors ultimately conclude that it would be great if humans lived in space—someday, if and when we’ve matured. But the three books all express concerns about efforts by commercial space companies, with the help of the US government, to bypass established space laws and norms—concerns that have been thoroughly validated in 2025.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The combustible relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has raised eyebrows about cronyism—and retribution—between governments and space companies. Space is rapidly becoming weaponized. And recent events have reminded us of the immense challenges of human spaceflight. SpaceX’s next-­generation Starship vehicle has suffered catastrophic failures in several test flights, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule experienced malfunctions that kept two astronauts on the International Space Station for months longer than expected. Even space tourism is developing a bad rap: In April, a star-studded all-woman crew on a Blue Origin suborbital flight was met with widespread backlash as a symbol of out-of-touch wealth and privilege.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is at this point that we must loop back to the issue of “suckitude,” which Mandel also channels in her book through the killer opening of M.T. Anderson’s novel &lt;em&gt;Feed&lt;/em&gt;: “We went to the moon to have fun, but the moon turned out to completely suck.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The dreams of space settlements put forward by Musk and Bezos are insanely fun. The reality may well suck. But it’s doubtful that any degree of suckitude will slow down the commercial space race, and the authors do at times seem to be yelling into the cosmic void.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, the books challenge space enthusiasts of all stripes to imagine new ways of relating to space that aren’t so tactile and exploitative. Along those lines, Rubenstein shares a compelling anecdote in &lt;em&gt;Astrotopia&lt;/em&gt; about an anthropologist who lived with an Inuit community in the early 1970s. When she told them about the Apollo moon landings, her hosts burst out in laughter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We didn’t know this was the first time you white people had been to the moon,” they said. “Our shamans go all the time … The issue is not whether we go to visit our relatives, but how we treat them and their homeland when we go.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Becky Ferreira is a science reporter based in upstate New York, and author of &lt;/em&gt;First Contact, &lt;em&gt;a book about the search for alien life, which will be published in September.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bitter rivals in the commercial space race, but they agree on one thing: Settling space is an existential imperative.

As her career took her from street protests in London to extravagant space industry banquets in Washington, DC, she writes, “crystal clear glasses” replaced “the rose-colored ones.”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Mandel remains enchanted by space but is skeptical that humans are the optimal trailblazers. Robots, rovers, probes, and other artificial space ambassadors could do the job for a fraction of the price and without risk to life, limb, and other corporeal vulnerabilities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A decentralization of self needs to occur,” she writes. “A dissolution of anthropocentrism, so to speak. And a recognition that future space explorers may not be man, even if man moves through them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, giant leaps for mankind no longer necessitate a man’s small steps; the wheels of a rover or the rotors of a copter offer a much better bang for our buck than boots on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Weinersmiths, Mandel devotes little attention to the physical dangers and limitations that space imposes on humans. She is more interested in a kind of psychic sickness that drives the impulse to abandon our planet and rush into new territories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a scholar of religion at Wesleyan University, presents a thorough diagnosis of this exact pathology in her 2022 book &lt;em&gt;Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race&lt;/em&gt;, which came out in paperback last year&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It all begins, appropriately enough, with the book of Genesis, where God creates Earth for the dominion of man. Over the years, this biblical brain worm has offered divine justification for the brutal colonization and environmental exploitation of our planet. Now it serves as the religious rocket fuel propelling humans into the next frontier, Rubenstein argues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of Astrotopia" class="wp-image-1121784" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/book.astrotopia.jpg?w=1241" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary-Jane Rubenstein&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS, 2022 &amp;nbsp;(PAPERBACK RELEASE 2024)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The intensifying ‘NewSpace race’ is as much a mythological project as it is a political, economic, or scientific one,” she writes. “It’s a mythology, in fact, that holds all these other efforts together, giving them an aura of duty, grandeur, and benevolence.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rubenstein makes a forceful case that malignant outgrowths of Christian ideas scaffold the dreams of space settlements championed by Musk, Bezos, and like-minded enthusiasts—even if these same people might never describe themselves as religious. If Earth is man’s dominion, space is the next logical step. Earth is just a temporary staging ground for a greater destiny; we will find our deliverance in the heavens.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Fuck Earth,” Elon Musk said in 2014. “Who cares about Earth? If we can establish a Mars colony, we can almost certainly colonize the whole solar system.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos, for one, claims to care about Earth; that’s among his best arguments for why humans should move beyond it. If heavy industries and large civilian populations cast off into the orbital expanse, our home world can be, in his words, “zoned residential and light industry,” allowing it to recover from anthropogenic pressures. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bezos also believes that space settlements are essential for the betterment of humanity, in part on the grounds that they will uncork our population growth. He envisions an orbital archipelago of stations, sprawled across the solar system, that could support a collective population of a trillion people. “That’s a thousand Mozarts. A thousand Einsteins,” Bezos has mused. “What a cool civilization that would be.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It does sound cool. But it’s an easy layup for Rubenstein: This “numbers game” approach would also produce a thousand Hitlers and Stalins, she writes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that is the real crux of the argument against pushing hard torapidly expand human civilization into space: We will still be humans when we get there. We won’t escape our vices and frailties by leaving Earth—in fact, we may exacerbate them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While all three books push back on the existential argument for space settlements, the Weinersmiths take the rebuttal one step further by proposing that space colonization might actually increase the risk of self-annihilation rather than neutralizing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Going to space will not end war because war isn’t caused by anything that space travel is apt to change, even in the most optimistic scenarios,” they write. “Humanity going to space en masse probably won’t reduce the likelihood of war, but we should consider that it might increase the chance of war being horrific.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The pair imagine rival space nations exchanging asteroid fire or poisoning whole biospheres. Proponents of space settlements often point to the fate of the dinosaurs as motivational grist, but what if a doomsday asteroid were deliberately flung between human cultures as a weapon? It may sound outlandish, but it’s no more speculative than a floating civilization with a thousand Mozarts. It follows the same logic of extrapolating our human future in space from our behavior on Earth in the past.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So should we just sit around and wait for our inevitable extinction? The three books have more or less the same response: What’s the rush? It is far more likely that humanity will be wiped out by our own activity in the near term than by any kind of cosmic threat. Worrying about the expansion of the sun in billions of years, as Musk has openly done, is frankly hysterical.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we have some growing up to do. Mandel and Rubenstein both argue that any worthy human future in space must adopt a decolonizing approach that emphasizes caretaking and stewardship of this planet and its inhabitants before we set off for others. They draw inspiration from science fiction, popular culture, and Indigenous knowledge, among other sources, to sketch out these alternative visions of an off-Earth future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mandel sees hope for this future in post-scarcity political theories. She cites various attempts to anticipate the needs of future generations—ideas found in the work of the social theorist Aaron Benanav, or in the values expressed by the Green New Deal, or in the fictional Ministry for the Future imagined by Kim Stanley Robinson in his 2020 novel of the same name. Whatever you think of the controversial 2025 book &lt;em&gt;Abundance&lt;/em&gt;, by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, it is also appealing to the same demand for a post-scarcity road map.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To that end, Mandel envisions “the creation of a governing body that would require that techno-scientific plans, especially those with a global reach, take into consideration multigenerational impacts and multigenerational voices.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Rubenstein, religion is the poison, but it may also offer the cure. She sees potential in a revival of pantheism, which is the belief that all the contents of the universe—from rocks to humans to galaxies—are divine and perhaps alive on some level. She hasn’t fully converted herself to this movement, let alone become an evangelist, but she says it’s a spiritual direction that could be an effective counterweight to dominionist views of the universe.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter whether … any sort of pantheism is ‘true,’” she writes. “What matters is the way any given mythology prompts us to interact with the world we’re a part of—the world each of our actions helps to make and unmake. And frankly, some mythologies prompt us to act better than others.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All these authors ultimately conclude that it would be great if humans lived in space—someday, if and when we’ve matured. But the three books all express concerns about efforts by commercial space companies, with the help of the US government, to bypass established space laws and norms—concerns that have been thoroughly validated in 2025.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The combustible relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has raised eyebrows about cronyism—and retribution—between governments and space companies. Space is rapidly becoming weaponized. And recent events have reminded us of the immense challenges of human spaceflight. SpaceX’s next-­generation Starship vehicle has suffered catastrophic failures in several test flights, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule experienced malfunctions that kept two astronauts on the International Space Station for months longer than expected. Even space tourism is developing a bad rap: In April, a star-studded all-woman crew on a Blue Origin suborbital flight was met with widespread backlash as a symbol of out-of-touch wealth and privilege.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is at this point that we must loop back to the issue of “suckitude,” which Mandel also channels in her book through the killer opening of M.T. Anderson’s novel &lt;em&gt;Feed&lt;/em&gt;: “We went to the moon to have fun, but the moon turned out to completely suck.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The dreams of space settlements put forward by Musk and Bezos are insanely fun. The reality may well suck. But it’s doubtful that any degree of suckitude will slow down the commercial space race, and the authors do at times seem to be yelling into the cosmic void.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, the books challenge space enthusiasts of all stripes to imagine new ways of relating to space that aren’t so tactile and exploitative. Along those lines, Rubenstein shares a compelling anecdote in &lt;em&gt;Astrotopia&lt;/em&gt; about an anthropologist who lived with an Inuit community in the early 1970s. When she told them about the Apollo moon landings, her hosts burst out in laughter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We didn’t know this was the first time you white people had been to the moon,” they said. “Our shamans go all the time … The issue is not whether we go to visit our relatives, but how we treat them and their homeland when we go.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Becky Ferreira is a science reporter based in upstate New York, and author of &lt;/em&gt;First Contact, &lt;em&gt;a book about the search for alien life, which will be published in September.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/22/1121428/case-against-space-travel-book-reviews/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Meet the researcher hosting a scientific conference by and for AI (Artificial intelligence – MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/22/1122304/ai-scientist-research-autonomous-agents/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-science-conference3.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In October, a new academic conference will debut that’s unlike any other. Agents4Science is a one-day online event that will encompass all areas of science, from physics to medicine. All of the work shared will have been researched, written, and reviewed primarily by AI, and will be presented using text-to-speech technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The conference is the brainchild of Stanford computer scientist James Zou, who studies how humans and AI can best work together. Artificial intelligence has already provided many useful tools for scientists, like DeepMind’s AlphaFold, which helps simulate proteins that are difficult to make physically. More recently, though, progress in large language models and reasoning-enabled AI has advanced the idea that AI can work more or less as autonomously as scientists themselves—proposing hypotheses, running simulations, and designing experiments on their own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That idea is not without its detractors. Among other issues, many feel AI is not capable of the creative thought needed in research, makes too many mistakes and hallucinations, and may limit opportunities for young researchers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a number of scientists and policymakers are very keen on the promise of AI scientists. The US government’s AI Action Plan describes the need to “invest in automated cloud-enabled labs for a range of scientific fields.” Some researchers think AI scientists could unlock scientific discoveries that humans could never find alone. For Zou, the proposition is simple: “AI agents are not limited in time. They could actually meet with us and work with us 24/7.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Last month, Zou published an article in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; with results obtained from his own group of autonomous AI workers. Spurred on by his success, he now wants to see what other AI scientists (that is, scientists that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; AI) can accomplish. He describes what a successful paper at Agents4Science will look like: “The AI should be the first author and do most of the work. Humans can be advisors.”&lt;/p&gt;   
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A virtual lab staffed by AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a PhD student at Harvard in the early 2010s, Zou was so interested in AI’s potential for science that he took a year off from his computing research to work in a genomics lab, in a field that has greatly benefited from technology to map entire genomes. His time in so-called wet labs taught him how difficult it can be to work with experts in other fields. “They often have different languages,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Large language models, he believes, are better than people at deciphering and translating between subject-specific jargon. “They’ve read so broadly,” Zou says, that they can translate and generalize ideas across science very well. This idea inspired Zou to dream up what he calls the “Virtual Lab.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At a high level, the Virtual Lab would be a team of AI agents designed to mimic an actual university lab group. These agents would have various fields of expertise and could interact with different programs, like AlphaFold. Researchers could give one or more of these agents an agenda to work on, then open up the model to play back how the agents communicated to each other and determine which experiments people should pursue in a real-world trial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zou needed a (human) collaborator to help put this idea into action and tackle an actual research problem. Last year, he met John E. Pak, a research scientist at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Pak, who shares Zou’s interest in using AI for science, agreed to make the Virtual Lab with him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pak would help set the topic, but both he and Zou wanted to see what approaches the Virtual Lab could come up with on its own. As a first project, they decided to focus on designing therapies for new covid-19 strains. With this goal in mind, Zou set off training five AI scientists (including ones trained to act like an immunologist, a computational biologist, and a principal investigator) with different objectives and programs at their disposal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Building these models took a few months, but Pak says they were very quick at designing candidates for therapies once the setup was complete: “I think it was a day or half a day, something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zou says the agents decided to study anti-covid nanobodies, a cousin of antibodies that are much smaller in size and less common in the wild. Zou was shocked, though, at the reason. He claims the models landed on nanobodies after making the connection that these smaller molecules would be well-suited to the limited computational resources the models were given. “It actually turned out to be a good decision, because the agents were able to design these nanobodies efficiently,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The nanobodies the models designed were genuinely new advances in science, and most were able to bind to the original covid-19 variant, according to the study. But Pak and Zou both admit that the main contribution of their article is really the Virtual Lab as a tool. Yi Shi, a pharmacologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the work but made some of the underlying nanobodies the Virtual Lab modified, agrees. He says he loves the Virtual Lab demonstration and that “the major novelty is the automation.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;accepted the article and fast-tracked it for publication preview—Zou knew leveraging AI agents for science was a hot area, and he wanted to be one of the first to test it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AI scientists host a conference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When he was submitting his paper, Zou was dismayed to see that he couldn’t properly credit AI for its role in the research. Most conferences and journals don’t allow AI to be listed as coauthors on papers, and many explicitly prohibit researchers from using AI to write papers or reviews. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, cites uncertainties over accountability, copyright, and inaccuracies among its reasons for banning the practice. “I think that’s limiting,” says Zou. “These kinds of policies are essentially incentivizing researchers to either hide or minimize their usage of AI.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zou wanted to flip the script by creating the Agents4Science conference, which requires the primary author on all submissions to be an AI. Other bots then will attempt to evaluate the work and determine its scientific merits. But people won’t be left out of the loop entirely: A team of human experts, including a Nobel laureate in economics, will review the top papers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zou isn’t sure what will come of the conference, but he hopes there will be some gems among the hundreds of submissions he expects to receive across all domains. “There could be AI submissions that make interesting discoveries,” he says. “There could also be AI submissions that have a lot of interesting mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While Zou says the response to the conference has been positive, some scientists are less than impressed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright has-text-align-right"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you get leaps of insight?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lisa Messeri&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lisa Messeri, an anthropologist of science at Yale University, has loads of questions about AI’s ability to review science: “How do you get leaps of insight? And what happens if a leap of insight comes onto the reviewer’s desk?” She doubts the conference will be able to give satisfying answers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, Messeri and her collaborator Molly Crockett investigated obstacles to using AI for science in another &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;article. They remain unconvinced of its ability to produce novel results, including those shared in Zou’s nanobodies paper.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“I’m the kind of scientist who is the target audience for these kinds of tools because I’m not a computer scientist … but I am doing computationally oriented work,” says Crockett, a cognitive scientist at Princeton University. “But I am at the same time very skeptical of the broader claims, especially with regard to how [AI scientists] might be able to simulate certain aspects of human thinking.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And they’re both skeptical of the value of using AI to do science if automation prevents human scientists from building up the expertise they need to oversee the bots. Instead, they advocate for involving experts from a wider range of disciplines to design more thoughtful experiments before trusting AI to perform and review science.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We need to be talking to epistemologists, philosophers of science, anthropologists of science, scholars who are thinking really hard about what knowledge is,” says Crockett.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Zou sees his conference as exactly the kind of experiment that could help push the field forward. When it comes to AI-generated science, he says, “there’s a lot of hype and a lot of anecdotes, but there’s really no systematic data.” Whether Agents4Science can provide that kind of data is an open question, but in October, the bots will at least try to show the world what they’ve got.&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-science-conference3.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In October, a new academic conference will debut that’s unlike any other.

With this goal in mind, Zou set off training five AI scientists (including ones trained to act like an immunologist, a computational biologist, and a principal investigator) with different objectives and programs at their disposal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Building these models took a few months, but Pak says they were very quick at designing candidates for therapies once the setup was complete: “I think it was a day or half a day, something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zou says the agents decided to study anti-covid nanobodies, a cousin of antibodies that are much smaller in size and less common in the wild. Zou was shocked, though, at the reason. He claims the models landed on nanobodies after making the connection that these smaller molecules would be well-suited to the limited computational resources the models were given. “It actually turned out to be a good decision, because the agents were able to design these nanobodies efficiently,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The nanobodies the models designed were genuinely new advances in science, and most were able to bind to the original covid-19 variant, according to the study. But Pak and Zou both admit that the main contribution of their article is really the Virtual Lab as a tool. Yi Shi, a pharmacologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the work but made some of the underlying nanobodies the Virtual Lab modified, agrees. He says he loves the Virtual Lab demonstration and that “the major novelty is the automation.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;accepted the article and fast-tracked it for publication preview—Zou knew leveraging AI agents for science was a hot area, and he wanted to be one of the first to test it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AI scientists host a conference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When he was submitting his paper, Zou was dismayed to see that he couldn’t properly credit AI for its role in the research. Most conferences and journals don’t allow AI to be listed as coauthors on papers, and many explicitly prohibit researchers from using AI to write papers or reviews. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, cites uncertainties over accountability, copyright, and inaccuracies among its reasons for banning the practice. “I think that’s limiting,” says Zou. “These kinds of policies are essentially incentivizing researchers to either hide or minimize their usage of AI.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zou wanted to flip the script by creating the Agents4Science conference, which requires the primary author on all submissions to be an AI. Other bots then will attempt to evaluate the work and determine its scientific merits. But people won’t be left out of the loop entirely: A team of human experts, including a Nobel laureate in economics, will review the top papers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zou isn’t sure what will come of the conference, but he hopes there will be some gems among the hundreds of submissions he expects to receive across all domains. “There could be AI submissions that make interesting discoveries,” he says. “There could also be AI submissions that have a lot of interesting mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While Zou says the response to the conference has been positive, some scientists are less than impressed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright has-text-align-right"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you get leaps of insight?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lisa Messeri&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lisa Messeri, an anthropologist of science at Yale University, has loads of questions about AI’s ability to review science: “How do you get leaps of insight? And what happens if a leap of insight comes onto the reviewer’s desk?” She doubts the conference will be able to give satisfying answers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, Messeri and her collaborator Molly Crockett investigated obstacles to using AI for science in another &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;article. They remain unconvinced of its ability to produce novel results, including those shared in Zou’s nanobodies paper.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“I’m the kind of scientist who is the target audience for these kinds of tools because I’m not a computer scientist … but I am doing computationally oriented work,” says Crockett, a cognitive scientist at Princeton University. “But I am at the same time very skeptical of the broader claims, especially with regard to how [AI scientists] might be able to simulate certain aspects of human thinking.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And they’re both skeptical of the value of using AI to do science if automation prevents human scientists from building up the expertise they need to oversee the bots. Instead, they advocate for involving experts from a wider range of disciplines to design more thoughtful experiments before trusting AI to perform and review science.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We need to be talking to epistemologists, philosophers of science, anthropologists of science, scholars who are thinking really hard about what knowledge is,” says Crockett.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Zou sees his conference as exactly the kind of experiment that could help push the field forward. When it comes to AI-generated science, he says, “there’s a lot of hype and a lot of anecdotes, but there’s really no systematic data.” Whether Agents4Science can provide that kind of data is an open question, but in October, the bots will at least try to show the world what they’ve got.&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/22/1122304/ai-scientist-research-autonomous-agents/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] The Download: Google’s AI energy expenditure, and handing over DNA data to the police (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/22/1122350/the-download-googles-ai-energy-expenditure-and-handing-over-dna-data-to-the-police/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is today's edition of&amp;nbsp;The Download&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt uses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google has just released a report detailing how much energy its Gemini apps use for each query.

Once the police had “matches” to a few relatives of the killer, they built a large family tree from which they plucked the likely suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process, called forensic investigative genetic genealogy, or FIGG, has since helped solve hundreds of murders and sexual assaults.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I wasn’t really driven by some urge to capture distantly related serial killers.

There are obvious upsides to using this kind of technology: AI could help take the guesswork out of the judging technicalities. It could even help to eliminate biases, making the sport both more fair and more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, others fear AI judging will take away something that makes gymnastics special. Gymnastics is a subjective sport, like diving or dressage, and technology could eliminate the judges’ role in crafting a narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, AI has officially infiltrated the world of gymnastics.

There are obvious upsides to using this kind of technology: AI could help take the guesswork out of the judging technicalities. It could even help to eliminate biases, making the sport both more fair and more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, others fear AI judging will take away something that makes gymnastics special. Gymnastics is a subjective sport, like diving or dressage, and technology could eliminate the judges’ role in crafting a narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, AI has officially infiltrated the world of gymnastics. The question now is whether it really makes it fairer.
