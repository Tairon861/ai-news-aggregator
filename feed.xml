The updates include animated profile pictures, photo-restyling tools for Stories and Memories, and the ability to add animated backgrounds to text posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​As Meta works to maintain Facebook’s relevance among younger users on its flagship app, it’s likely betting that these new features will deliver a more personalized experience that appeals to Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​The new animated profile picture feature applies motion effects to static photos, making the subject appear to be waving, making a heart shape, or wearing a virtual party hat. To achieve the best results, Facebook recommends using a clear photo of a single person facing the camera. Photos can be pulled directly from a user’s camera roll or from images already on the platform. The company also plans to add more animation options throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3091610" height="591" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/FB-animatedProfile-Picture.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​Facebook is also enhancing its Stories — short photo and video posts that disappear after 24 hours — and Memories — a feature that resurfaces posts from the same date in previous years — with “Restyle,” a tool that uses Meta AI to reimagine the look of user-uploaded images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After uploading a photo to Stories or selecting a Memory to share, users can tap Restyle and either enter a text-based prompt or select from preset themes, including anime, illustrated, glowy, ethereal, and more. There are also options to adjust moods, lighting, and colors, and to swap in new backdrops such as a beach or a cityscape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​To spice up text posts, Facebook is also gradually rolling out animated backgrounds. By clicking on the new rainbow “A” icon, users can choose from a variety of still and animated scenes, such as falling leaves or rolling ocean waves, to make their posts stand out in the feed. The company says that seasonal backgrounds are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3091611" height="592" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/FB-AI-Text-Posts.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​With around 2.1 billion daily active users, Facebook remains a social media giant. However, in recent years, it has struggled to attract and retain a younger demographic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Robert Playter announced in an internal memo on Tuesday that he would be stepping down as the company’s chief executive, as first reported by A3. Amanda McMaster, the company’s&amp;nbsp;chief financial officer,&amp;nbsp;will stand in for the top job while the company&amp;nbsp;looks&amp;nbsp;for a replacement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Boston Dynamics sent TechCrunch the following statement, “Robert Playter is an icon of the global robotics industry, and the entire Boston Dynamics team wishes to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude for his leadership. From the earliest days of hopping robots, to the world’s first quadrupeds, to spearheading the entire humanoid industry, Playter made his mark as a pioneer of innovation. He transformed Boston Dynamics from a small research and development lab into a successful business that now proudly calls itself the global leader in mobile robotics. He will be sorely missed, but we hope he enjoys some well-deserved time off. Thanks Rob.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Playter took the helm at Boston Dynamics in 2020, taking over from founder Marc Raibert. Playter worked at Boston Dynamics for 30 years, where he held other roles, including vice president of engineering and chief operating officer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Boston Dynamics&amp;nbsp;was founded in&amp;nbsp;1992 by Raibert as a spinoff from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a professor. Google’s parent company Alphabet bought Boston Dynamics in 2013,&amp;nbsp;before the company was sold to Japanese investing conglomerate SoftBank in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hyundai, its current owner, acquired the company in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The robotics producer is best known for its quadruped robot, Spot, which the company commercialized in 2020 shortly after Playter took the helm. The company most recently announced Atlas, a humanoid robot.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The signals that drive many of the brain and body’s most essential functions — consciousness, sleep, breathing, heart rate, and motion — course through bundles of “white matter” fibers in the brainstem, but imaging systems so far have been unable to finely resolve these crucial neural cables. That has left researchers and doctors with little capability to assess how they are affected by trauma or neurodegeneration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, a team of MIT, Harvard University, and Massachusetts General Hospital researchers unveil AI-powered software capable of automatically segmenting eight distinct bundles in any diffusion MRI sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the open-access study, published Feb. 6 in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;the research team led by MIT graduate student Mark Olchanyi reports that their BrainStem Bundle Tool (BSBT), which they’ve made publicly available, revealed distinct patterns of structural changes in patients with Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury, and shed light on Alzheimer’s disease as well. Moreover, the study shows, BSBT retrospectively enabled tracking of bundle healing in a coma patient that reflected the patient’s seven-month road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brainstem is a region of the brain that is essentially not explored because it is tough to image,” says Olchanyi, a doctoral candidate in MIT’s Medical Engineering and Medical Physics Program. “People don't really understand its makeup from an imaging perspective. We need to understand what the organization of the white matter is in humans and how this organization breaks down in certain disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adds Professor Emery N. Brown, Olchanyi’s thesis supervisor and co-senior author of the study, “the brainstem is one of the body’s most important control centers. Mark’s algorithms are a significant contribution to imaging research and to our ability to the understand regulation of fundamental physiology. By enhancing our capacity&amp;nbsp;to image the brainstem, he offers us new access to vital physiological functions such as control of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, temperature regulation, how we stay awake during the day and how sleep at night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown is the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Computational Neuroscience and Medical Engineering in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. He is also an anesthesiologist at MGH and a professor at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diffusion MRI helps trace the long branches, or “axons,” that neurons extend to communicate with each other. Axons are typically clad in a sheath of fat called myelin, and water diffuses along the axons within the myelin, which is also called the brain’s “white matter.” Diffusion MRI can highlight this very directed displacement of water. But segmenting the distinct bundles of axons in the brainstem has proved challenging, because they are small and masked by flows of brain fluids and the motions produced by breathing and heart beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of his thesis work to better understand the neural mechanisms that underpin consciousness, Olchanyi wanted to develop an AI algorithm to overcome these obstacles. BSBT works by tracing fiber bundles that plunge into the brainstem from neighboring areas higher in the brain, such as the thalamus and the cerebellum, to produce a “probabilistic fiber map.” An artificial intelligence module called a “convolutional neural network” then combines the map with several channels of imaging information from within the brainstem to distinguish eight individual bundles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To train the neural network to segment the bundles, Olchanyi “showed” it 30 live diffusion MRI scans from volunteers in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The scans were manually annotated to teach the neural network how to identify the bundles. Then he validated BSBT by testing its output against “ground truth” dissections of post-mortem human brains where the bundles were well delineated via microscopic inspection or very slow but ultra-high-resolution imaging. After training, BSBT became proficient in automatically identifying the eight distinct fiber bundles in new scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an experiment to test its consistency and reliability, Olchanyi tasked BSBT with finding the bundles in 40 volunteers who underwent separate scans two months apart. In each case, the tool was able to find the same bundles in the same patients in each of their two scans. Olchanyi also tested BSBT with multiple datasets (not just the HCP), and even inspected how each component of the neural network contributed to BSBT’s analysis by hobbling them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We put the neural network through the wringer,” Olchanyi says. “We wanted to make sure that it’s actually doing these plausible segmentations and it is leveraging each of its individual components in a way that improves the accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential novel biomarkers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the algorithm was properly trained and validated, the research team moved on to testing whether the ability to segment distinct fiber bundles in diffusion MRI scans could enable tracking of how each bundle’s volume and structure varied with disease or injury, creating a novel kind of biomarker. Although the brainstem has been difficult to examine in detail, many studies show that neurodegenerative diseases affect the brainstem, often early on in their progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olchanyi, Brown and their co-authors applied BSBT to scores of datasets of diffusion MRI scans from patients with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, MS, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients were compared to controls and sometimes to themselves over time. In the scans, the tool measured bundle volume and “fractional anisotropy,” (FA) which tracks how much water is flowing along the myelinated axons versus how much is diffusing in other directions, a proxy for white matter structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each condition, the tool found consistent patterns of changes in the bundles. While only one bundle showed significant decline in Alzheimer’s, in Parkinson’s the tool revealed a reduction in FA in three of the eight bundles. It also revealed volume loss in another bundle in patients between a baseline scan and a two-year follow-up. Patients with MS showed their greatest FA reductions in four bundles and volume loss in three. Meanwhile, TBI patients didn’t show significant volume loss in any bundles, but FA reductions were apparent in the majority of bundles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing in the study showed that BSBT proved more accurate than other classifier methods in discriminating between patients with health conditions versus controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BSBT, therefore, can be “a key adjunct that aids current diagnostic imaging methods by providing a fine-grained assessment of brainstem white matter structure and, in some cases, longitudinal information,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the case of a 29-year-old man who suffered a severe TBI, Olchanyi applied BSBT to a scans taken during the man’s seven-month coma. The tool showed that the man’s brainstem bundles had been displaced, but not cut, and showed that over his coma, the lesions on the nerve bundles decreased by a factor of three in volume. As they healed, the bundles moved back into place as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors wrote that BSBT “has substantial prognostic potential by identifying preserved brainstem bundles that can facilitate coma recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s other senior authors are Juan Eugenio Iglesias and Brian Edlow. Other co-authors are David Schreier, Jian Li, Chiara Maffei, Annabel Sorby-Adams, Hannah Kinney, Brian Healy, Holly Freeman, Jared Shless, Christophe Destrieux, and Hendry Tregidgo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for the study came from the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Defense, James S.

            &lt;p&gt;The signals that drive many of the brain and body’s most essential functions — consciousness, sleep, breathing, heart rate, and motion — course through bundles of “white matter” fibers in the brainstem, but imaging systems so far have been unable to finely resolve these crucial neural cables. That has left researchers and doctors with little capability to assess how they are affected by trauma or neurodegeneration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, a team of MIT, Harvard University, and Massachusetts General Hospital researchers unveil AI-powered software capable of automatically segmenting eight distinct bundles in any diffusion MRI sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the open-access study, published Feb. 6 in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;the research team led by MIT graduate student Mark Olchanyi reports that their BrainStem Bundle Tool (BSBT), which they’ve made publicly available, revealed distinct patterns of structural changes in patients with Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury, and shed light on Alzheimer’s disease as well. Moreover, the study shows, BSBT retrospectively enabled tracking of bundle healing in a coma patient that reflected the patient’s seven-month road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brainstem is a region of the brain that is essentially not explored because it is tough to image,” says Olchanyi, a doctoral candidate in MIT’s Medical Engineering and Medical Physics Program. “People don't really understand its makeup from an imaging perspective. We need to understand what the organization of the white matter is in humans and how this organization breaks down in certain disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adds Professor Emery N. Brown, Olchanyi’s thesis supervisor and co-senior author of the study, “the brainstem is one of the body’s most important control centers. Mark’s algorithms are a significant contribution to imaging research and to our ability to the understand regulation of fundamental physiology. By enhancing our capacity&amp;nbsp;to image the brainstem, he offers us new access to vital physiological functions such as control of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, temperature regulation, how we stay awake during the day and how sleep at night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown is the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Computational Neuroscience and Medical Engineering in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. He is also an anesthesiologist at MGH and a professor at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diffusion MRI helps trace the long branches, or “axons,” that neurons extend to communicate with each other. Axons are typically clad in a sheath of fat called myelin, and water diffuses along the axons within the myelin, which is also called the brain’s “white matter.” Diffusion MRI can highlight this very directed displacement of water. But segmenting the distinct bundles of axons in the brainstem has proved challenging, because they are small and masked by flows of brain fluids and the motions produced by breathing and heart beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of his thesis work to better understand the neural mechanisms that underpin consciousness, Olchanyi wanted to develop an AI algorithm to overcome these obstacles. BSBT works by tracing fiber bundles that plunge into the brainstem from neighboring areas higher in the brain, such as the thalamus and the cerebellum, to produce a “probabilistic fiber map.” An artificial intelligence module called a “convolutional neural network” then combines the map with several channels of imaging information from within the brainstem to distinguish eight individual bundles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To train the neural network to segment the bundles, Olchanyi “showed” it 30 live diffusion MRI scans from volunteers in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The scans were manually annotated to teach the neural network how to identify the bundles. Then he validated BSBT by testing its output against “ground truth” dissections of post-mortem human brains where the bundles were well delineated via microscopic inspection or very slow but ultra-high-resolution imaging. After training, BSBT became proficient in automatically identifying the eight distinct fiber bundles in new scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an experiment to test its consistency and reliability, Olchanyi tasked BSBT with finding the bundles in 40 volunteers who underwent separate scans two months apart. In each case, the tool was able to find the same bundles in the same patients in each of their two scans. Olchanyi also tested BSBT with multiple datasets (not just the HCP), and even inspected how each component of the neural network contributed to BSBT’s analysis by hobbling them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We put the neural network through the wringer,” Olchanyi says. “We wanted to make sure that it’s actually doing these plausible segmentations and it is leveraging each of its individual components in a way that improves the accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential novel biomarkers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the algorithm was properly trained and validated, the research team moved on to testing whether the ability to segment distinct fiber bundles in diffusion MRI scans could enable tracking of how each bundle’s volume and structure varied with disease or injury, creating a novel kind of biomarker. Although the brainstem has been difficult to examine in detail, many studies show that neurodegenerative diseases affect the brainstem, often early on in their progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olchanyi, Brown and their co-authors applied BSBT to scores of datasets of diffusion MRI scans from patients with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, MS, and traumatic brain injury (TBI).

But the sibling duo used AI music in their rhythm dance program, which doesn’t break any official rules, but serves as a depressing symbol of how absolutely cooked we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Mrázek spun his sister in a crazy cartwheel-lift-sort-of-move that made them look superhuman, one of the NBC commentators mentioned in passing, “This is AI generated, this first part,” referring to the music. Somehow, that admission is even more baffling than the gravity-defying tricks that the siblings showed off on the pressure of Olympic ice.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Olympic ice dance competition is split into two events: the rhythm dance, where pairs must perform a routine that meets a specific theme, and the free dance. This season’s theme is “The Music, Dance Styles, and Feeling of the 1990s.” British ice dancing duo Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson paid tribute to the Spice Girls, while United States favorites Madison Chock and Evan Bates skated to a Lenny Kravitz medley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But, for whatever reason — licensing issues? — Mrázková and Mrázek danced to a routine with music that’s half AC/DC and half AI. It’s weird. What’s even weirder is that this isn’t the duo’s first use of AI, nor is it the first time that this choice backfired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Per the International Skating Union, the governing body that oversees competitive ice skating, the duo’s music choice for the rhythm dance this season has been “One Two by AI (of 90s style Bon Jovi)” and “Thunderstruck by AC/DC.” The official Olympics website confirms that the duo is using the AI-generated song for the rhythm dance portion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Czech siblings have faced backlash before for using AI-generated music. Earlier in the season, they played a ’90s-inspired song for their routine that began with a wailing declaration: “Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz!” If that sounds familiar, it’s because that lyric comes directly from the ’90s hit “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals (which, by the way, has an incredible music video shot in a Staten Island mall — the true essence of American suburbia!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI-generated lyrics also include the lines, “Wake up, kids/We got the dreamer’s disease,” and “First we run, and then we laugh ’til we cry.” What a coincidence! Those lyrics also appear in the song “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals. The AI song is even titled “One Two,” which are the first words of… you can probably guess which song at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before the Olympics, the duo changed the song, swapping out the New Radicals lyrics for other AI-generated lyrics that sound suspiciously like Bon Jovi lyrics, as journalist Shana Bartels noted in November. For example, “raise your hands, set the night on fire” also appear in “Raise Your Hands” by Bon Jovi… and the AI “vocalist” sounds a lot like Bon Jovi, too. (Not to pour salt on the wound, but “Raise Your Hands” isn’t even from the ’90s!) This was the music that the duo danced to on Monday at the Olympics, before it transitioned into “Thunderstruck” by AC/DC, a real song from the ’90s written by real people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While it’s unclear what software the team used to generate this music, this is an LLM operating as it’s supposed to. These LLMs are trained on large libraries of music, often through legally dubious means. When prompted, LLMs produce the most statistically probable response to an input. That’s useful when writing code, but means a song “in the style of Bon Jovi,” will likely end up using some actual Bon Jovi lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And yet, the music industry seems at least temporarily enamored with the idea of “musicians” who aren’t totally real. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to set her (hopefully real) poetry to music under the persona Xania Monet. Now she has a $3 million record deal.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a shame that these Czech dancers’ accomplishment of skating at the Olympics may be marred by discourse around their use of AI music (discourse that I am actively contributing to).

Now, as tech companies look for legally safe sources of AI training data, Amazon is reportedly considering launching a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Information reported Monday that the e-commerce giant has been meeting with publishing executives and alerting them to its plans to launch such a marketplace. Ahead of an AWS conference for publishers that occurred Tuesday, Amazon “circulated slides that mention a content marketplace,” wrote the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Reached by TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson didn’t deny the story but didn’t directly address the would-be marketplace either, saying only: “Amazon has built long-lasting, innovative relationships with publishers across many areas of our business, including AWS, Retail, Advertising, AGI, and Alexa. We are always innovating together to best serve our customers, but we have nothing specific to share on this subject at this time.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon wouldn’t be the first major tech company to take this route. Microsoft recently launched what it calls a Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), which it says will give publishers “a new revenue stream” while also providing AI systems with “scaled access to premium content.” Microsoft added that the PCM was designed to “empower publishers with a transparent economic framework for licensing” their content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move is a natural next step for the AI industry, which has already sought to solve the legally nebulous problem of how copyrighted material ends up in AI training data by forging deals with major news outlets and media organizations. OpenAI, for instance, has already signed content-licensing partnerships with the Associated Press, Vox Media, News Corp, and The Atlantic, among others. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those efforts haven’t been enough to stem the legal fallout. The fight over copyrighted material in AI algorithms has led to a monsoon of lawsuits, and the issue is still being worked out by the judicial system. New regulatory strategies to deal with the issue are being proposed all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Media publishers have also fretted about the ways in which AI summaries — particularly those surfaced by Google in its search results — may be depressing traffic to their sites. One recent study claimed that such summaries have had a “devastating” impact on the number of users clicking through to websites. The Information’s report notes that publishers may view the new marketplace-based content-sharing system as a “more sustainable business [than current, more limited licensing partnerships] that will scale up revenue” as AI usage continues to escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

New regulatory strategies to deal with the issue are being proposed all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Media publishers have also fretted about the ways in which AI summaries — particularly those surfaced by Google in its search results — may be depressing traffic to their sites. One recent study claimed that such summaries have had a “devastating” impact on the number of users clicking through to websites. The Information’s report notes that publishers may view the new marketplace-based content-sharing system as a “more sustainable business [than current, more limited licensing partnerships] that will scale up revenue” as AI usage continues to escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Less than a day later, on Tuesday afternoon, xAI co-founder Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said that he, too, is bouncing, posting a gracious note on X on his way out. “Enormous thanks to @elonmusk for bringing us together on this incredible journey. So proud of what the xAI team has done and will continue to stay close as a friend of the team,” it read in part.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On their own, both were pretty standard tech departure announcements — but they’re part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Six members of the company’s 12-person founding team have now left the company, with five of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkin left to found a venture firm, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month, citing health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with bizarre behavior and apparent internal tampering — the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that flooded the platform with deepfake pornography, sparking slow-moving but real legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already spinning up plans for orbital data centers, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn’t slowing down, and if Grok can’t keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The allegation that I discriminated against anyone is absolutely false,” Beiermeister told the Journal. TechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for comment and also contacted an email that appears to be associated with Beiermeister; neither had responded at the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Per the Journal’s report, Beiermeister’s termination came after she expressed criticism of a planned ChatGPT feature dubbed “adult mode.” The new mode would introduce erotica into the chatbot user experience. Fidji Simo, who serves as OpenAI’s CEO of Applications — a role overseeing the company’s consumer-facing products — has told reporters that the new feature is planned to launch during the first quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beiermeister and others at the company have raised concerns about how the new “adult” feature could potentially impact certain users, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI reportedly said that Beiermeister, who was fired following a leave of absence, had&amp;nbsp;“made valuable contributions during her time at OpenAI, and her departure was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beiermeister’s LinkedIn profile says she previously worked for four years on Meta’s product team and spent more than seven years working for Palantir.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2195918462.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Ryan Beiermeister, who served as OpenAI’s vice president of product policy, was fired in January after a male colleague accused her of sex discrimination, the Wall Street Journal has reported.&lt;/p&gt;

Evidently, he wanted to talk about the future of his AI company, and specifically, how it relates to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to The New York Times, which reports that it heard the meeting, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult. “You have to go to the moon,” he said, per the Times. The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he added, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What Musk didn’t appear to address clearly was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly merged xAI-SpaceX entity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux. “If you’re moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,” he told employees, per the Times, “and xAI is moving faster than any other company — no one’s even close.” He added that “when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It isn’t clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too. That brings the total to six of xAI’s 12 founding members who have now left the young company. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with a SpaceX IPO reportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The moon itself is a more recent preoccupation. For most of SpaceX’s 24-year existence, Mars was the end game. This past Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Musk surprised many, posting that SpaceX had “shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon,” arguing that a Mars colony would take “20+ years.” The moon, he said, could get there in half the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a pretty big change in direction for a company that has never sent a mission to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rationally or otherwise, investors do seem considerably more excited about data centers in orbit than about colonies on other planets. (Even for the most patient money in the room, that’s a long timeline.) But to at least one venture backer in xAI who talked with this editor last year, the lunar ambitions have nothing to do with Wall Street and aren’t a distraction from xAI’s core mission; they’re inseparable from it. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The theory, laid out by the VC at the time, is that Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning: the world’s most powerful world model, an AI trained not just on text and images but on proprietary real-world data that no competitor can replicate. Tesla contributes energy systems and road topology. Neuralink offers a window into the brain. SpaceX provides physics and orbital mechanics. The Boring Company adds some subsurface data. Add a moon factory to the mix and you start to see the outline of something very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whether that vision is achievable is a very big question. Another is whether it is legal. Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation — and by extension, no company — can claim sovereignty over the moon. But a 2015 U.S. law opened a significant loophole — while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of science and technology studies at Wesleyan University, explained to TechCrunch last month, the distinction is somewhat illusory. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams,” she said. “Because the stuff that is in the moon &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the moon.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That legal framework is the scaffolding on which Musk’s moon ambitions apparently rest, even as not everyone has agreed to play by those rules (China and Russia certainly have not).
