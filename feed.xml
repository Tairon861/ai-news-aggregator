            &lt;p&gt;Say a person takes their French Bulldog, Bowser, to the dog park. Identifying Bowser as he plays among the other canines is easy for the dog-owner to do while onsite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if someone wants to use a generative AI model like GPT-5 to monitor their pet while they are at work, the model could fail at this basic task. Vision-language models like GPT-5 often excel at recognizing general objects, like a dog, but they perform poorly at locating personalized objects, like Bowser the French Bulldog.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this shortcoming, researchers from MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab have introduced a new training method that teaches vision-language models to localize personalized objects in a scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their method uses carefully prepared video-tracking data in which the same object is tracked across multiple frames. They designed the dataset so the model must focus on contextual clues to identify the personalized object, rather than relying on knowledge it previously memorized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When given a few example images showing a personalized object, like someone’s pet, the retrained model is better able to identify the location of that same pet in a new image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Models retrained with their method outperformed state-of-the-art systems at this task. Importantly, their technique leaves the rest of the model’s general abilities intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new approach could help future AI systems track specific objects across time, like a child’s backpack, or localize objects of interest, such as a species of animal in ecological monitoring. It could also aid in the development of AI-driven assistive technologies that help visually impaired users find certain items in a room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, we want these models to be able to learn from context, just like humans do. If a model can do this well, rather than retraining it for each new task, we could just provide a few examples and it would infer how to perform the task from that context. This is a very powerful ability,” says Jehanzeb Mirza, an MIT postdoc and senior author of a paper on this technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirza is joined on the paper by co-lead authors Sivan Doveh, a graduate student at Weizmann Institute of Science; and Nimrod Shabtay, a researcher at IBM Research; James Glass, a senior research scientist and the head of the Spoken Language Systems Group in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); and others. The work will be presented at the International Conference on Computer Vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An unexpected shortcoming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that large language models (LLMs) can excel at learning from context. If they feed an LLM a few examples of a task, like addition problems, it can learn to answer new addition problems based on the context that has been provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vision-language model (VLM) is essentially an LLM with a visual component connected to it, so the MIT researchers thought it would inherit the LLM’s in-context learning capabilities. But this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research community has not been able to find a black-and-white answer to this particular problem yet. The bottleneck could arise from the fact that some visual information is lost in the process of merging the two components together, but we just don’t know,” Mirza says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to improve VLMs abilities to do in-context localization, which involves finding a specific object in a new image. They focused on the data used to retrain existing VLMs for a new task, a process called fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical fine-tuning data are gathered from random sources and depict collections of everyday objects. One image might contain cars parked on a street, while another includes a bouquet of flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no real coherence in these data, so the model never learns to recognize the same object in multiple images,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fix this problem, the researchers developed a new dataset by curating samples from existing video-tracking data. These data are video clips showing the same object moving through a scene, like a tiger walking across a grassland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They cut frames from these videos and structured the dataset so each input would consist of multiple images showing the same object in different contexts, with example questions and answers about its location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By using multiple images of the same object in different contexts, we encourage the model to consistently localize that object of interest by focusing on the context,” Mirza explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forcing the focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers found that VLMs tend to cheat. Instead of answering based on context clues, they will identify the object using knowledge gained during pretraining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, since the model already learned that an image of a tiger and the label “tiger” are correlated, it could identify the tiger crossing the grassland based on this pretrained knowledge, instead of inferring from context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, the researchers used pseudo-names rather than actual object category names in the dataset. In this case, they changed the name of the tiger to “Charlie.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It took us a while to figure out how to prevent the model from cheating. But we changed the game for the model. The model does not know that ‘Charlie’ can be a tiger, so it is forced to look at the context,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also faced challenges in finding the best way to prepare the data. If the frames are too close together, the background would not change enough to provide data diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, finetuning VLMs with this new dataset improved accuracy at personalized localization by about 12 percent on average. When they included the dataset with pseudo-names, the performance gains reached 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As model size increases, their technique leads to greater performance gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to study possible reasons VLMs don’t inherit in-context learning capabilities from their base LLMs. In addition, they plan to explore additional mechanisms to improve the performance of a VLM without the need to retrain it with new data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work reframes few-shot personalized object localization — adapting on the fly to the same object across new scenes — as an instruction-tuning problem and uses video-tracking sequences to teach VLMs to localize based on visual context rather than class priors. It also introduces the first benchmark for this setting with solid gains across open and proprietary VLMs. Given the immense significance of quick, instance-specific grounding — often without finetuning — for users of real-world workflows (such as robotics, augmented reality assistants, creative tools, etc.), the practical, data-centric recipe offered by this work can help enhance the widespread adoption of vision-language foundation models,” says Saurav Jha, a postdoc at the Mila-Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, who was not involved with this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional co-authors are Wei Lin, a research associate at Johannes Kepler University; Eli Schwartz, a research scientist at IBM Research; Hilde Kuehne, professor of computer science at&amp;nbsp;Tuebingen AI Center and an affiliated professor at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab; Raja Giryes, an associate professor at Tel Aviv University; Rogerio Feris, a principal scientist and manager at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab; Leonid Karlinsky, a principal research scientist at IBM Research; Assaf Arbelle, a senior research scientist at IBM Research; and Shimon Ullman, the Samy and Ruth Cohn Professor of Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was funded, in part, by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

Basically, the idea is to use trees or some other types of biomass for energy, and then capture the emissions when you burn it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While corporations, including tech giants like Microsoft, are betting big on this technology, there are a few potential problems with BECCS, as my colleague James Temple laid out in a new story. And some of the concerns echo similar problems with other climate technologies we cover, like carbon offsets and alternative jet fuels.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbon math can be complicated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To illustrate one of the biggest issues with BECCS, we need to run through the logic on its carbon accounting. (And while this tech can use many different forms of biomass, let’s assume we’re talking about trees.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When trees grow, they suck up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Those trees can be harvested and used for some intended purpose, like making paper. The leftover material, which might otherwise be waste, is then processed and burned for energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This cycle is, in theory, carbon neutral. The emissions from burning the biomass are canceled out by what was removed from the atmosphere during plants’ growth. (Assuming those trees are replaced after they’re harvested.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So now imagine that carbon-scrubbing equipment is added to the facility that burns the biomass, capturing emissions. If the cycle was logically carbon neutral before, now it’s carbon negative: On net, emissions are removed from the atmosphere. Sounds great, no notes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are a few problems with this math, though. For one, it leaves out the emissions that might be produced while harvesting, transporting, and processing wood. And if projects require clearing land to plant trees or grow crops, that transformation can wind up releasing emissions too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Issues with carbon math might sound a little familiar if you’ve read any of James’s reporting on carbon offsets, programs where people pay for others to avoid emissions. In particular, his 2021 investigation with ProPublica’s Lisa Song laid out how this so-called solution was actually adding millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbon capture may entrench polluting facilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the big benefits of BECCS is that it can be added to existing facilities. There’s less building involved than there might be in something like a facility that vacuums carbon directly out of air. That helps keep costs down, so BECCS is currently much cheaper than direct air capture and other forms of carbon removal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But keeping legacy equipment running might not be a great thing for emissions or local communities in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide is far from the only pollutant spewing out of these facilities. Burning biomass or biofuels can release emissions that harm human health, like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Carbon capture equipment might trap some of these pollutants, like sulfur dioxide, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assuming that waste material wouldn’t be used for something else might not be right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It sounds great to use waste, but there’s a major asterisk lurking here, as James lays out in the story:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the critical question that emerges with waste is: Would it otherwise have been burned or allowed to decompose, or might some of it have been used in some other way that kept the carbon out of the atmosphere?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Biomass can be used for other things, like making plastic, building material, or even soil additives that can help crops get more nutrients. So the assumption that it’s BECCS or nothing is flawed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a weird thing happens when you start making waste valuable: There’s an incentive to produce more of it. Some experts are concerned that companies could wind up trimming more trees or clearing more forests than what’s needed to make more material for BECCS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These waste issues remind me of conversations around sustainable aviation fuels. These alternative fuels can be made from a huge range of materials, including crop waste or even used cooking oil. But as demand for these clean fuels has ballooned, things have gotten a little wonky—there are even some reports of fraud, where scammers try to pass off newly made oil from crops as used cooking oil.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;BECCS is a potentially useful technology, but like many things in climate tech, it can quickly get complicated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;James has been reporting on carbon offsets and carbon removal for years. As he put it to me this week when we were chatting about this story: “Just cut emissions and stop messing around.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

Carbon capture equipment might trap some of these pollutants, like sulfur dioxide, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assuming that waste material wouldn’t be used for something else might not be right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It sounds great to use waste, but there’s a major asterisk lurking here, as James lays out in the story:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the critical question that emerges with waste is: Would it otherwise have been burned or allowed to decompose, or might some of it have been used in some other way that kept the carbon out of the atmosphere?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Biomass can be used for other things, like making plastic, building material, or even soil additives that can help crops get more nutrients. So the assumption that it’s BECCS or nothing is flawed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a weird thing happens when you start making waste valuable: There’s an incentive to produce more of it. Some experts are concerned that companies could wind up trimming more trees or clearing more forests than what’s needed to make more material for BECCS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These waste issues remind me of conversations around sustainable aviation fuels. These alternative fuels can be made from a huge range of materials, including crop waste or even used cooking oil. But as demand for these clean fuels has ballooned, things have gotten a little wonky—there are even some reports of fraud, where scammers try to pass off newly made oil from crops as used cooking oil.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;BECCS is a potentially useful technology, but like many things in climate tech, it can quickly get complicated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;James has been reporting on carbon offsets and carbon removal for years. As he put it to me this week when we were chatting about this story: “Just cut emissions and stop messing around.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

This bundle of cells, about the size of a grain of sand pulled from a powdery white Caribbean beach, contains the coiled potential of a future life: 46 chromosomes, thousands of genes, and roughly six billion base pairs of DNA—an instruction manual to assemble a one-of-a-kind human.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now imagine a laser pulse snipping a hole in the blastocyst’s outermost shell so a handful of cells can be suctioned up by a microscopic pipette. This is the moment, thanks to advances in genetic sequencing technology, when it becomes possible to read virtually that entire instruction manual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;An emerging field of science seeks to use the analysis pulled from that procedure to predict what kind of a person that embryo might become. Some parents turn to these tests to avoid passing on devastating genetic disorders that run in their families. A much smaller group, driven by dreams of Ivy League diplomas or attractive, well-behaved offspring, are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to optimize for intelligence, appearance, and personality. Some of the most eager early boosters of this technology are members of the Silicon Valley elite, including tech billionaires like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embryo selection is less like a build-a-baby workshop and more akin to a store where parents can shop for their future children from several available models—complete with stat cards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But customers of the companies emerging to provide it to the public may not be getting what they’re paying for. Genetics experts have been highlighting the potential deficiencies of this testing for years. A 2021 paper by members of the European Society of Human Genetics said, “No clinical research has been performed to assess its diagnostic effectiveness in embryos. Patients need to be properly informed on the limitations of this use.” And a paper published this May in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/em&gt; echoed this concern and expressed particular reservations about screening for psychiatric disorders and non-­disease-related traits: “Unfortunately, no clinical research has to date been published comprehensively evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy [of predictive testing]. Patient awareness regarding the limitations of this procedure is paramount.” &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the assumptions underlying some of this work—that how a person turns out is the product not of privilege or circumstance but of innate biology—have made these companies a political lightning rod.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125496" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_1.jpg?w=1388" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;As this niche technology begins to make its way toward the mainstream, scientists and ethicists are racing to confront the implications—for our social contract, for future generations, and for our very understanding of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), while still relatively rare, is not new. Since the 1990s, parents undergoing in vitro fertilization have been able to access a number of genetic tests before choosing which embryo to use. A type known as PGT-M can detect single-gene disorders like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington’s disease. PGT-A can ascertain the sex of an embryo and identify chromosomal abnormalities that can lead to conditions like Down syndrome or reduce the chances that an embryo will implant successfully in the uterus. PGT-SR helps parents avoid embryos with issues such as duplicated or missing segments of the chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those tests all identify clear-cut genetic problems that are relatively easy to detect, but most of the genetic instruction manual included in an embryo is written in far more nuanced code. In recent years, a fledgling market has sprung up around a new, more advanced version of the testing process called PGT-P: preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disorders (and, some claim, traits)—that is, outcomes determined by the elaborate interaction of hundreds or thousands of genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2020, the first baby selected using PGT-P was born. While the exact figure is unknown, estimates put the number of children who have now been born with the aid of this technology in the hundreds. As the technology is commercialized, that number is likely to grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Embryo selection is less like a build-a-baby workshop and more akin to a store where parents can shop for their future children from several available models—complete with stat cards indicating their predispositions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A handful of startups, armed with tens of millions of dollars of Silicon Valley cash, have developed proprietary algorithms to compute these stats—analyzing vast numbers of genetic variants and producing a “polygenic risk score” that shows the probability of an embryo developing a variety of complex traits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the last five years or so, two companies—Genomic Prediction and Orchid—have dominated this small landscape, focusing their efforts on disease prevention. But more recently, two splashy new competitors have emerged: Nucleus Genomics and Herasight, which have rejected the more cautious approach of their predecessors and waded into the controversial territory of genetic testing for intelligence. (Nucleus also offers tests for a wide variety of other behavioral and appearance-related traits.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The practical limitations of polygenic risk scores are substantial. For starters, there is still a lot we don’t understand about the complex gene interactions driving polygenic traits and disorders. And the biobank data sets they are based on tend to overwhelmingly represent individuals with Western European ancestry, making it more difficult to generate reliable scores for patients from other backgrounds. These scores also lack the full context of environment, lifestyle, and the myriad other factors that can influence a person’s characteristics. And while polygenic risk scores can be effective at detecting large, population-level trends, their predictive abilities drop significantly when the sample size is as tiny as a single batch of embryos that share much of the same DNA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The medical community—including organizations like the American Society of Human Genetics, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine—is generally wary of using polygenic risk scores for embryo selection. “The practice has moved too fast with too little evidence,” the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics wrote in an official statement in 2024.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;But beyond questions of whether evidence supports the technology’s effectiveness, critics of the companies selling it accuse them of reviving a disturbing ideology: eugenics, or the belief that selective breeding can be used to improve humanity. Indeed, some of the voices who have been most confident that these methods can successfully predict nondisease traits have made startling claims about natural genetic hierarchies and innate racial differences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What everyone can agree on, though, is that this new wave of technology is helping to inflame a centuries-old debate over nature versus nurture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The term “eugenics” was coined in 1883 by a British anthropologist and statistician named Sir Francis Galton, inspired in part by the work of his cousin Charles Darwin. He derived it from a Greek word meaning “good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of modern history’s darkest chapters have been built on Galton’s legacy, from the Holocaust to the forced sterilization laws that affected certain groups in the United States well into the 20th century. Modern science has demonstrated the many logical and empirical problems with Galton’s methodology. (For starters, he counted vague concepts like “eminence”—as well as infections like syphilis and tuberculosis—as heritable phenotypes, meaning characteristics that result from the interaction of genes and environment.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet even today, Galton’s influence lives on in the field of behavioral genetics, which investigates the genetic roots of psychological traits. Starting in the 1960s, researchers in the US began to revisit one of Galton’s favorite methods: twin studies. Many of these studies, which analyzed pairs of identical and fraternal twins to try to determine which traits were heritable and which resulted from socialization, were funded by the US government. The most well-known of these, the Minnesota Twin Study, also accepted grants from the Pioneer Fund, a now defunct nonprofit that had promoted eugenics and “race betterment” since its founding in 1937.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The nature-versus-nurture debate hit a major inflection point in 2003, when the Human Genome Project was declared complete. After 13 years and at a cost of nearly $3 billion, an international consortium of thousands of researchers had sequenced 92% of the human genome for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the cost of sequencing a genome can be as low as $600, and one company says it will soon drop even further. This dramatic reduction has made it possible to build massive DNA databases like the UK Biobank and the National Institutes of Health’s All of Us, each containing genetic data from more than half a million volunteers. Resources like these have enabled researchers to conduct genome-wide association studies, or GWASs, which identify correlations between genetic variants and human traits by analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—the most common form of genetic variation between individuals. The findings from these studies serve as a reference point for developing polygenic risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most GWASs have focused on disease prevention and personalized medicine. But in 2011, a group of medical researchers, social scientists, and economists launched the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC) to investigate the genetic basis of complex social and behavioral outcomes. One of the phenotypes they focused on was the level of education people reached.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It was a bit of a phenotype of convenience,” explains Patrick Turley, an economist and member of the steering committee at SSGAC, given that educational attainment is routinely recorded in surveys when genetic data is collected. Still, it was “clear that genes play some role,” he says. “And trying to understand what that role is, I think, is really interesting.” He adds that social scientists can also use genetic data to try to better “understand the role that is due to &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;genetic pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many on the left are generally willing to allow that any number of traits, from addiction to obesity, are genetically influenced. Yet heritable cognitive ability seems to be “beyond the pale for us to integrate as a source of difference.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The work immediately stirred feelings of discomfort—not least among the consortium’s own members, who feared that they might unintentionally help reinforce racism, inequality, and genetic determinism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s also created quite a bit of discomfort in some political circles, says Kathryn Paige Harden, a psychologist and behavioral geneticist at the University of Texas in Austin, who says she has spent much of her career making the unpopular argument to fellow liberals that genes are relevant predictors of social outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Harden thinks a strength of those on the left is their ability to recognize “that bodies are different from each other in a way that matters.” Many are generally willing to allow that any number of traits, from addiction to obesity, are genetically influenced. Yet, she says, heritable cognitive ability seems to be “beyond the pale for us to integrate as a source of difference that impacts our life.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harden believes that genes matter for our understanding of traits like intelligence, and that this should help shape progressive policymaking. She gives the example of an education department seeking policy interventions to improve math scores in a given school district. If a polygenic risk score is “as strongly correlated with their school grades” as family income is, she says of the students in such a district, then “does deliberately not collecting that [genetic] information, or not knowing about it, make your research harder [and] your inferences worse?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To Harden, persisting with this strategy of avoidance for fear of encouraging eugenicists is a mistake. If “insisting that IQ is a myth and genes have nothing to do with it was going to be successful at neutralizing eugenics,” she says, “it would’ve won by now.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason these ideas are so taboo in many circles is that today’s debate around genetic determinism is still deeply infused with Galton’s ideas—and has become a particular fixation among the online right.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125497" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_2.jpg?w=1389" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Elon Musk took over Twitter (now X) in 2022 and loosened its restrictions on hate speech, a flood of accounts started sharing racist posts, some speculating about the genetic origins of inequality while arguing against immigration and racial integration. Musk himself frequently reposts and engages with accounts like Crémieux Recueil, the pen name of independent researcher Jordan Lasker, who has written about the “Black-White IQ gap,” and i/o, an anonymous account that once praised Musk for “acknowledging data on race and crime,” saying it “has done more to raise awareness of the disproportionalities observed in these data than anything I can remember.” (In response to allegations that his research encourages eugenics, Lasker wrote to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, “The popular understanding of eugenics is about coercion and cutting people cast as ‘undesirable’ out of the breeding pool. This is nothing like that, so it doesn’t qualify as eugenics by that popular understanding of the term.” After going to print, i/o wrote&amp;nbsp;in an email,&amp;nbsp;“Just because differences in intelligence at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;level are largely heritable, it does not mean that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;differences in measured intelligence ... are due to genetic differences between groups,”&amp;nbsp;but that the latter is not “scientifically settled” and&amp;nbsp;“an extremely important (and necessary) research area that should be funded rather than made taboo.”&amp;nbsp;He added,&amp;nbsp;“I’ve never made any argument against racial integration or intermarriage or whatever.”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Harden, though, warns against discounting the work of an entire field because of a few noisy neoreactionaries. “I think there can be this idea that technology is giving rise to the terrible racism,” she says. The truth, she believes, is that “the racism has preexisted any of this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2019, a company called Genomic Prediction began to offer the first preimplantation polygenic testing that had ever been made commercially available. With its LifeView Embryo Health Score, prospective parents are able to assess their embryos’ predisposition to genetically complex health problems like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Pricing for the service starts at $3,500. Genomic Prediction uses a technique called an SNP array, which targets specific sites in the genome where common variants occur. The results are then cross-checked against GWASs that show correlations between genetic variants and certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four years later, a company named Orchid began offering a competing test. Orchid’s Whole Genome Embryo Report distinguished itself by claiming to sequence more than 99% of an embryo’s genome, allowing it to detect novel mutations and, the company says, diagnose rare diseases more accurately. For $2,500 per embryo, parents can access polygenic risk scores for 12 disorders, including schizophrenia, breast cancer, and hypothyroidism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Orchid was founded by a woman named Noor Siddiqui. Before getting undergraduate and graduate degrees from Stanford, she was awarded the Thiel fellowship—a $200,000 grant given to young entrepreneurs willing to work on their ideas instead of going to college—back when she was a teenager, in 2012. This set her up to attract attention from members of the tech elite as both customers and financial backers. Her company has raised $16.5 million to date from investors like Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, and Armstrong, the Coinbase CEO.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In August Siddiqui made the controversial suggestion that parents who choose not to use genetic testing might be considered irresponsible. “Just be honest: you’re okay with your kid potentially suffering for life so you can feel morally superior …” she wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Americans have varied opinions on the emerging technology. In 2024, a group of bioethicists surveyed 1,627 US adults to determine attitudes toward a variety of polygenic testing criteria. A large majority approved of testing for physical health conditions like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Screening for mental health disorders, like depression, OCD, and ADHD, drew a more mixed—but still positive—response. Appearance-related traits, like skin color, baldness, and height, received less approval as something to test for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Intelligence was among the most contentious traits—unsurprising given the way it has been weaponized throughout history and the lack of cultural consensus on how it should even be defined. (In many countries, intelligence testing for embryos is heavily regulated; in the UK, the practice is banned outright.) In the 2024 survey, 36.9% of respondents approved of preimplantation genetic testing for intelligence, 40.5% disapproved, and 22.6% said they were uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125500" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ND25-feature_baby.png?w=589" width="589" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the disagreement, intelligence has been among the traits most talked about as targets for testing. From early on, Genomic Prediction says, it began receiving inquiries “from all over the world” about testing for intelligence, according to Diego Marin, the company’s head of global business development and scientific affairs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At one time, the company offered a predictor for what it called “intellectual disability.” After some backlash questioning both the predictive capacity and the ethics of these scores, the company discontinued the feature. “Our mission and vision of this company is not to improve [a baby], but to reduce risk for disease,” Marin told me. “When it comes to traits about IQ or skin color or height or something that’s cosmetic and doesn’t really have a connotation of a disease, then we just don’t invest in it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Orchid, on the other hand, does test for genetic markers associated with intellectual disability and developmental delay. But that may not be all. According to one employee of the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, intelligence testing is also offered to “high-roller” clients. According to this employee, another source close to the company, and reporting in the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post,&lt;/em&gt; Musk used Orchid’s services in the conception of at least one of the children he shares with the tech executive Shivon Zilis. (Orchid, Musk, and Zilis did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I met Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder of New York–based Nucleus Genomics, on a sweltering July afternoon in his SoHo office. Slight and kinetic, Sadeghi spoke at a machine-gun pace, pausing only occasionally to ask if I was keeping up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi had modified his first organism—a sample of brewer’s yeast—at the age of 16. As a high schooler in 2016, he was taking a course on CRISPR-Cas9 at a Brooklyn laboratory when he fell in love with the “beautiful depth” of genetics. Just a few years later, he dropped out of college to build “a better 23andMe.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His company targets what you might call the application layer of PGT-P, accepting data from IVF clinics—and even from the competitors mentioned in this story—and running its own computational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Unlike a lot of the other testing companies, we’re software first, and we’re consumer first,” Sadeghi told me. “It’s not enough to give someone a polygenic score. What does that mean? How do you compare them? There’s so many really hard design problems.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like its competitors, Nucleus calculates its polygenic risk scores by comparing an individual’s genetic data with trait-associated variants identified in large GWASs, providing statistically informed predictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nucleus provides two displays of a patient’s results: a Z-score, plotted from –4 to 4, which explains the risk of a certain trait relative to a population with similar genetic ancestry (for example, if Embryo #3 has a 2.1 Z-score for breast cancer, its risk is higher than average), and an absolute risk score, which includes relevant clinical factors (Embryo #3 has a minuscule actual risk of breast cancer, given that it is male).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The real difference between Nucleus and its competitors lies in the breadth of what it claims to offer clients. On its sleek website, prospective parents can sort through more than 2,000 possible diseases, as well as traits from eye color to IQ. Access to the Nucleus Embryo platform costs $8,999, while the company’s new IVF+ offering—which includes one IVF cycle with a partner clinic, embryo screening for up to 20 embryos, and concierge services throughout the process—starts at $24,999.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Maybe you want your baby to have blue eyes versus green eyes,” Nucleus founder Kian Sadeghi said at a June event. “That is up to the liberty of the parents.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Its promises are remarkably bold. The company claims to be able to forecast a propensity for anxiety, ADHD, insomnia, and other mental issues. It says you can see which of your embryos are more likely to have alcohol dependence, which are more likely to be left-handed, and which might end up with severe acne or seasonal allergies. (Nevertheless, at the time of writing, the embryo-screening platform provided this disclaimer: “DNA is not destiny. Genetics can be a helpful tool for choosing an embryo, but it’s not a guarantee. Genetic research is still in it’s [sic] infancy, and there’s still a lot we don’t know about how DNA shapes who we are.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To people accustomed to sleep trackers, biohacking supplements, and glucose monitoring, taking advantage of Nucleus’s options might seem like a no-brainer. To anyone who welcomes a bit of serendipity in their life, this level of perceived control may be disconcerting to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi likes to frame his arguments in terms of personal choice. “Maybe you want your baby to have blue eyes versus green eyes,” he told a small audience at Nucleus Embryo’s June launch event. “That is up to the liberty of the parents.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the official launch day, Sadeghi spent hours gleefully sparring with X users who accused him of practicing eugenics. He rejects the term, favoring instead “genetic optimization”—though it seems he wasn’t too upset about the free viral marketing. “This week we got five million impressions on Twitter,” he told a crowd at the launch event, to a smattering of applause. (In an email to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review, &lt;/em&gt;Sadeghi wrote, “The history of eugenics is one of coercion and discrimination by states and institutions; what Nucleus does is the opposite—genetic forecasting that empowers individuals to make informed decisions.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nucleus has raised more than $36 million from investors like Srinivasan, Alexis Ohanian’s venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, and Thiel’s Founders Fund. (Like Siddiqui, Sadeghi was a recipient of a Thiel fellowship when he dropped out of college; a representative for Thiel did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) Sadeghi has even poached Genomic Prediction’s cofounder Nathan Treff, who is now Nucleus’s chief clinical officer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi’s real goal is to build a one-stop shop for every possible application of genetic sequencing technology, from genealogy to precision medicine to genetic engineering. He names a handful of companies providing these services, with a combined market cap in the billions. “Nucleus is collapsing all five of these companies into one,” he says. “We are not an IVF testing company. We are a genetic stack.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This spring, I elbowed my way into a packed hotel bar in the Flatiron district, where over a hundred people had gathered to hear a talk called “How to create SUPERBABIES.” The event was part of New York’s Deep Tech Week, so I expected to meet a smattering of biotech professionals and investors. Instead, I was surprised to encounter a diverse and curious group of creatives, software engineers, students, and prospective parents—many of whom had come with no previous knowledge of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The speaker that evening was Jonathan Anomaly, a soft-spoken political philosopher whose didactic tone betrays his years as a university professor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of Anomaly’s academic work has focused on developing theories of rational behavior. At Duke and the University of Pennsylvania, he led introductory courses on game theory, ethics, and collective action problems as well as bioethics, digging into thorny questions about abortion, vaccines, and euthanasia. But perhaps no topic has interested him so much as the emerging field of genetic enhancement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2018, in a bioethics journal, Anomaly published a paper with the intentionally provocative title “Defending Eugenics.” He sought to distinguish what he called “positive eugenics”—noncoercive methods aimed at increasing traits that “promote individual and social welfare”—from the so-called “negative eugenics” we know from our history books.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anomaly likes to argue that embryo selection isn’t all that different from practices we already take for granted. Don’t believe two cousins should be allowed to have children? Perhaps you’re a eugenicist, he contends. Your friend who picked out a six-foot-two Harvard grad from a binder of potential sperm donors? Same logic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His hiring at the University of Pennsylvania in 2019 caused outrage among some students, who accused him of “racial essentialism.” In 2020, Anomaly left academia, lamenting that “American universities had become an intellectual prison.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few years later, Anomaly joined a nascent PGT-P company named Herasight, which was promising to screen for IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the end of July, the company officially emerged from stealth mode. A representative told me that most of the money raised so far is from angel investors, including Srinivasan, who also invested in Orchid and Nucleus. According to the launch announcement on X, Herasight has screened “hundreds of embryos” for private customers and is beginning to offer its first publicly available consumer product, a polygenic assessment that claims to detect an embryo’s likelihood of developing 17 diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their marketing materials boast predictive abilities 122% better than Orchid’s and 193% better than Genomic Prediction’s for this set of diseases. (“Herasight is comparing their current predictor to models we published over five years ago,” Genomic Prediction responded in a statement. “Our team is confident our predictors are world-class and are not exceeded in quality by any other lab.”)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company did not include comparisons with Nucleus, pointing to the “absence of published performance validations” by that company and claiming it represented a case where “marketing outpaces science.” (“Nucleus is known for world-class science and marketing, and we understand why that’s frustrating to our competitors,” a representative from the company responded in a comment.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Herasight also emphasized new advances in “within-family validation” (making sure that the scores are not merely picking up shared environmental factors by comparing their performance between unrelated people to their performance between siblings) and “cross-­ancestry accuracy” (improving the accuracy of scores for people outside the European ancestry groups where most of the biobank data is concentrated). The representative explained that pricing varies by customer and the number of embryos tested, but it can reach $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to traits that Jonathan Anomaly believes are genetically encoded, intelligence is just the tip of the iceberg. He has also spoken about the heritability of empathy, violence, religiosity, and political leanings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Herasight tests for just one non-disease-related trait: intelligence. For a couple who produce 10 embryos, it claims it can detect an IQ spread of about 15 points, from the lowest-scoring embryo to the highest. The representative says the company plans to release a detailed white paper on its IQ predictor in the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The day of Herasight’s launch, Musk responded to the company announcement: “Cool.” Meanwhile, a Danish researcher named Emil Kirkegaard, whose research has largely focused on IQ differences between racial groups, boosted the company to his nearly 45,000 followers on X (as well as in a Substack blog), writing, “Proper embryo selection just landed.” Kirkegaard has in fact supported Anomaly’s work for years; he’s posted about him on X and recommended his 2020 book &lt;em&gt;Creating Future People,&lt;/em&gt; which he called a “biotech eugenics advocacy book,” adding: “Naturally, I agree with this stuff!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to traits that Anomaly believes are genetically encoded, intelligence—which he claimed in his talk is about 75% heritable—is just the tip of the iceberg. He has also spoken about the heritability of empathy, impulse control, violence, passivity, religiosity, and political leanings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anomaly concedes there are limitations to the kinds of relative predictions that can be made from a small batch of embryos. But he believes we’re only at the dawn of what he likes to call the “reproductive revolution.” At his talk, he pointed to a technology currently in development at a handful of startups: in vitro gametogenesis. IVG aims to create sperm or egg cells in a laboratory using adult stem cells, genetically reprogrammed from cells found in a sample of skin or blood. In theory, this process could allow a couple to quickly produce a practically unlimited number of embryos to analyze for preferred traits. Anomaly predicted this technology could be ready to use on humans within eight years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125510" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_3_1.jpg?w=1617" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I doubt the FDA will allow it immediately. That’s what places like Próspera are for,” he said, referring to the so-called “startup city” in Honduras, where scientists and entrepreneurs can conduct medical experiments free from the kinds of regulatory oversight they’d encounter in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You might have a moral intuition that this is wrong,” said Anomaly, “but when it’s discovered that elites are doing it privately … the dominoes are going to fall very, very quickly.” The coming “evolutionary arms race,” he claimed, will “change the moral landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He added that some of those elites are his own customers: “I could already name names, but I won’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After Anomaly’s talk was over, I spoke with a young photographer who told me he was hoping to pursue a master’s degree in theology. He came to the event, he told me, to reckon with the ethical implications of playing God. “Technology is sending us toward an Old-to-New-Testament transition moment, where we have to decide what parts of religion still serve us,” he said soberly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Criticisms of polygenic testing tend to fall into two camps: skepticism about the tests’ effectiveness and concerns about their ethics. “On one hand,” says Turley from the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium, “you have arguments saying ‘This isn’t going to work anyway, and the reason it’s bad is because we’re tricking parents, which would be a problem.’ And on the other hand, they say, ‘Oh, this is going to work so well that it’s going to lead to enormous inequalities in society.’ It’s just funny to see. Sometimes these arguments are being made by the same people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of those people is Sasha Gusev, who runs a quantitative genetics lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. A vocal critic of PGT-P for embryo selection, he also often engages in online debates with the far-right accounts promoting race science on X.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gusev is one of many professionals in his field who believe that because of numerous confounding socioeconomic factors—for example, childhood nutrition, geography, personal networks, and parenting styles—there isn’t much point in trying to trace outcomes like educational attainment back to genetics, particularly not as a way to prove that there’s a genetic basis for IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He adds, “I think there’s a real risk in moving toward a society where you see genetics and ‘genetic endowments’ as the drivers of people’s behavior and as a ceiling on their outcomes and their capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gusev thinks there is real promise for this technology in clinical settings among specific adult populations. For adults identified as having high polygenic risk scores for cancer and cardiovascular disease, he argues, a combination of early screening and intervention could be lifesaving. But when it comes to the preimplantation testing currently on the market, he thinks there are significant limitations—and few regulatory measures or long-term validation methods to check the promises companies are making. He fears that giving these services too much attention could backfire.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“These reckless, overpromised, and oftentimes just straight-up manipulative embryo selection applications are a risk for the credibility and the utility of these clinical tools,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many IVF patients have also had strong reactions to publicity around PGT-P. When the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published an opinion piece about Orchid in the spring, angry parents took to Reddit to rant. One user posted, “For people who dont [sic] know why other types of testing are necessary or needed this just makes IVF people sound like we want to create ‘perfect’ babies, while we just want (our) healthy babies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, others defended the need for a conversation. “When could technologies like this change the mission from helping infertile people have healthy babies to eugenics?” one Redditor posted. “It’s a fine line to walk and an important discussion to have.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some PGT-P proponents, like Kirkegaard and Anomaly, have argued that policy decisions should more explicitly account for genetic differences. In a series of blog posts following the 2024 presidential election, under the header “Make science great again,” Kirkegaard called for ending affirmative action laws, legalizing race-based hiring discrimination, and removing restrictions on data sets like the NIH’s All of Us biobank that prevent researchers like him from using the data for race science. Anomaly has criticized social welfare policies for putting a finger on the scale to “punish the high-IQ people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the notion of genetic determinism has gained some traction among loyalists to President Donald Trump.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, Trump himself made a campaign stop on the conservative radio program &lt;em&gt;The Hugh Hewitt Show. &lt;/em&gt;He began a rambling answer about immigration and homicide statistics. “A murderer, I believe this, it’s in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now,” he told the host.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gusev believes that while embryo selection won’t have much impact on individual outcomes, the intellectual framework endorsed by many PGT-P advocates could have dire social consequences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you just think of the differences that we observe in society as being cultural, then you help people out. You give them better schooling, you give them better nutrition and education, and they’re able to excel,” he says. “If you think of these differences as being strongly innate, then you can fool yourself into thinking that there’s nothing that can be done and people just are what they are at birth.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the time being, there are no plans for longitudinal studies to track &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; outcomes for the humans these companies have helped bring into the world. Harden, the behavioral geneticist from UT Austin, suspects that 25 years down the line, adults who were once embryos selected on the basis of polygenic risk scores are “going to end up with the same question that we all have.” They will look at their life and wonder, “What would’ve had to change for it to be different?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julia Black is a Brooklyn-based features writer and a reporter in residence at Omidyar Network.

This bundle of cells, about the size of a grain of sand pulled from a powdery white Caribbean beach, contains the coiled potential of a future life: 46 chromosomes, thousands of genes, and roughly six billion base pairs of DNA—an instruction manual to assemble a one-of-a-kind human.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now imagine a laser pulse snipping a hole in the blastocyst’s outermost shell so a handful of cells can be suctioned up by a microscopic pipette. This is the moment, thanks to advances in genetic sequencing technology, when it becomes possible to read virtually that entire instruction manual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;An emerging field of science seeks to use the analysis pulled from that procedure to predict what kind of a person that embryo might become. Some parents turn to these tests to avoid passing on devastating genetic disorders that run in their families. A much smaller group, driven by dreams of Ivy League diplomas or attractive, well-behaved offspring, are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to optimize for intelligence, appearance, and personality. Some of the most eager early boosters of this technology are members of the Silicon Valley elite, including tech billionaires like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embryo selection is less like a build-a-baby workshop and more akin to a store where parents can shop for their future children from several available models—complete with stat cards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But customers of the companies emerging to provide it to the public may not be getting what they’re paying for. Genetics experts have been highlighting the potential deficiencies of this testing for years. A 2021 paper by members of the European Society of Human Genetics said, “No clinical research has been performed to assess its diagnostic effectiveness in embryos. Patients need to be properly informed on the limitations of this use.” And a paper published this May in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/em&gt; echoed this concern and expressed particular reservations about screening for psychiatric disorders and non-­disease-related traits: “Unfortunately, no clinical research has to date been published comprehensively evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy [of predictive testing]. Patient awareness regarding the limitations of this procedure is paramount.” &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the assumptions underlying some of this work—that how a person turns out is the product not of privilege or circumstance but of innate biology—have made these companies a political lightning rod.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125496" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_1.jpg?w=1388" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;As this niche technology begins to make its way toward the mainstream, scientists and ethicists are racing to confront the implications—for our social contract, for future generations, and for our very understanding of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), while still relatively rare, is not new. Since the 1990s, parents undergoing in vitro fertilization have been able to access a number of genetic tests before choosing which embryo to use. A type known as PGT-M can detect single-gene disorders like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington’s disease. PGT-A can ascertain the sex of an embryo and identify chromosomal abnormalities that can lead to conditions like Down syndrome or reduce the chances that an embryo will implant successfully in the uterus. PGT-SR helps parents avoid embryos with issues such as duplicated or missing segments of the chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those tests all identify clear-cut genetic problems that are relatively easy to detect, but most of the genetic instruction manual included in an embryo is written in far more nuanced code. In recent years, a fledgling market has sprung up around a new, more advanced version of the testing process called PGT-P: preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disorders (and, some claim, traits)—that is, outcomes determined by the elaborate interaction of hundreds or thousands of genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2020, the first baby selected using PGT-P was born. While the exact figure is unknown, estimates put the number of children who have now been born with the aid of this technology in the hundreds. As the technology is commercialized, that number is likely to grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Embryo selection is less like a build-a-baby workshop and more akin to a store where parents can shop for their future children from several available models—complete with stat cards indicating their predispositions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A handful of startups, armed with tens of millions of dollars of Silicon Valley cash, have developed proprietary algorithms to compute these stats—analyzing vast numbers of genetic variants and producing a “polygenic risk score” that shows the probability of an embryo developing a variety of complex traits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the last five years or so, two companies—Genomic Prediction and Orchid—have dominated this small landscape, focusing their efforts on disease prevention. But more recently, two splashy new competitors have emerged: Nucleus Genomics and Herasight, which have rejected the more cautious approach of their predecessors and waded into the controversial territory of genetic testing for intelligence. (Nucleus also offers tests for a wide variety of other behavioral and appearance-related traits.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The practical limitations of polygenic risk scores are substantial. For starters, there is still a lot we don’t understand about the complex gene interactions driving polygenic traits and disorders. And the biobank data sets they are based on tend to overwhelmingly represent individuals with Western European ancestry, making it more difficult to generate reliable scores for patients from other backgrounds. These scores also lack the full context of environment, lifestyle, and the myriad other factors that can influence a person’s characteristics. And while polygenic risk scores can be effective at detecting large, population-level trends, their predictive abilities drop significantly when the sample size is as tiny as a single batch of embryos that share much of the same DNA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The medical community—including organizations like the American Society of Human Genetics, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine—is generally wary of using polygenic risk scores for embryo selection. “The practice has moved too fast with too little evidence,” the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics wrote in an official statement in 2024.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;But beyond questions of whether evidence supports the technology’s effectiveness, critics of the companies selling it accuse them of reviving a disturbing ideology: eugenics, or the belief that selective breeding can be used to improve humanity. Indeed, some of the voices who have been most confident that these methods can successfully predict nondisease traits have made startling claims about natural genetic hierarchies and innate racial differences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What everyone can agree on, though, is that this new wave of technology is helping to inflame a centuries-old debate over nature versus nurture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The term “eugenics” was coined in 1883 by a British anthropologist and statistician named Sir Francis Galton, inspired in part by the work of his cousin Charles Darwin. He derived it from a Greek word meaning “good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of modern history’s darkest chapters have been built on Galton’s legacy, from the Holocaust to the forced sterilization laws that affected certain groups in the United States well into the 20th century. Modern science has demonstrated the many logical and empirical problems with Galton’s methodology. (For starters, he counted vague concepts like “eminence”—as well as infections like syphilis and tuberculosis—as heritable phenotypes, meaning characteristics that result from the interaction of genes and environment.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet even today, Galton’s influence lives on in the field of behavioral genetics, which investigates the genetic roots of psychological traits. Starting in the 1960s, researchers in the US began to revisit one of Galton’s favorite methods: twin studies. Many of these studies, which analyzed pairs of identical and fraternal twins to try to determine which traits were heritable and which resulted from socialization, were funded by the US government. The most well-known of these, the Minnesota Twin Study, also accepted grants from the Pioneer Fund, a now defunct nonprofit that had promoted eugenics and “race betterment” since its founding in 1937.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The nature-versus-nurture debate hit a major inflection point in 2003, when the Human Genome Project was declared complete. After 13 years and at a cost of nearly $3 billion, an international consortium of thousands of researchers had sequenced 92% of the human genome for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the cost of sequencing a genome can be as low as $600, and one company says it will soon drop even further. This dramatic reduction has made it possible to build massive DNA databases like the UK Biobank and the National Institutes of Health’s All of Us, each containing genetic data from more than half a million volunteers. Resources like these have enabled researchers to conduct genome-wide association studies, or GWASs, which identify correlations between genetic variants and human traits by analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—the most common form of genetic variation between individuals. The findings from these studies serve as a reference point for developing polygenic risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most GWASs have focused on disease prevention and personalized medicine. But in 2011, a group of medical researchers, social scientists, and economists launched the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC) to investigate the genetic basis of complex social and behavioral outcomes. One of the phenotypes they focused on was the level of education people reached.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It was a bit of a phenotype of convenience,” explains Patrick Turley, an economist and member of the steering committee at SSGAC, given that educational attainment is routinely recorded in surveys when genetic data is collected. Still, it was “clear that genes play some role,” he says. “And trying to understand what that role is, I think, is really interesting.” He adds that social scientists can also use genetic data to try to better “understand the role that is due to &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;genetic pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many on the left are generally willing to allow that any number of traits, from addiction to obesity, are genetically influenced. Yet heritable cognitive ability seems to be “beyond the pale for us to integrate as a source of difference.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The work immediately stirred feelings of discomfort—not least among the consortium’s own members, who feared that they might unintentionally help reinforce racism, inequality, and genetic determinism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s also created quite a bit of discomfort in some political circles, says Kathryn Paige Harden, a psychologist and behavioral geneticist at the University of Texas in Austin, who says she has spent much of her career making the unpopular argument to fellow liberals that genes are relevant predictors of social outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Harden thinks a strength of those on the left is their ability to recognize “that bodies are different from each other in a way that matters.” Many are generally willing to allow that any number of traits, from addiction to obesity, are genetically influenced. Yet, she says, heritable cognitive ability seems to be “beyond the pale for us to integrate as a source of difference that impacts our life.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harden believes that genes matter for our understanding of traits like intelligence, and that this should help shape progressive policymaking. She gives the example of an education department seeking policy interventions to improve math scores in a given school district. If a polygenic risk score is “as strongly correlated with their school grades” as family income is, she says of the students in such a district, then “does deliberately not collecting that [genetic] information, or not knowing about it, make your research harder [and] your inferences worse?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To Harden, persisting with this strategy of avoidance for fear of encouraging eugenicists is a mistake. If “insisting that IQ is a myth and genes have nothing to do with it was going to be successful at neutralizing eugenics,” she says, “it would’ve won by now.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason these ideas are so taboo in many circles is that today’s debate around genetic determinism is still deeply infused with Galton’s ideas—and has become a particular fixation among the online right.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125497" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_2.jpg?w=1389" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Elon Musk took over Twitter (now X) in 2022 and loosened its restrictions on hate speech, a flood of accounts started sharing racist posts, some speculating about the genetic origins of inequality while arguing against immigration and racial integration. Musk himself frequently reposts and engages with accounts like Crémieux Recueil, the pen name of independent researcher Jordan Lasker, who has written about the “Black-White IQ gap,” and i/o, an anonymous account that once praised Musk for “acknowledging data on race and crime,” saying it “has done more to raise awareness of the disproportionalities observed in these data than anything I can remember.” (In response to allegations that his research encourages eugenics, Lasker wrote to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, “The popular understanding of eugenics is about coercion and cutting people cast as ‘undesirable’ out of the breeding pool. This is nothing like that, so it doesn’t qualify as eugenics by that popular understanding of the term.” After going to print, i/o wrote&amp;nbsp;in an email,&amp;nbsp;“Just because differences in intelligence at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;level are largely heritable, it does not mean that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;differences in measured intelligence ... are due to genetic differences between groups,”&amp;nbsp;but that the latter is not “scientifically settled” and&amp;nbsp;“an extremely important (and necessary) research area that should be funded rather than made taboo.”&amp;nbsp;He added,&amp;nbsp;“I’ve never made any argument against racial integration or intermarriage or whatever.”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Harden, though, warns against discounting the work of an entire field because of a few noisy neoreactionaries. “I think there can be this idea that technology is giving rise to the terrible racism,” she says. The truth, she believes, is that “the racism has preexisted any of this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2019, a company called Genomic Prediction began to offer the first preimplantation polygenic testing that had ever been made commercially available. With its LifeView Embryo Health Score, prospective parents are able to assess their embryos’ predisposition to genetically complex health problems like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Pricing for the service starts at $3,500. Genomic Prediction uses a technique called an SNP array, which targets specific sites in the genome where common variants occur. The results are then cross-checked against GWASs that show correlations between genetic variants and certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four years later, a company named Orchid began offering a competing test. Orchid’s Whole Genome Embryo Report distinguished itself by claiming to sequence more than 99% of an embryo’s genome, allowing it to detect novel mutations and, the company says, diagnose rare diseases more accurately. For $2,500 per embryo, parents can access polygenic risk scores for 12 disorders, including schizophrenia, breast cancer, and hypothyroidism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Orchid was founded by a woman named Noor Siddiqui. Before getting undergraduate and graduate degrees from Stanford, she was awarded the Thiel fellowship—a $200,000 grant given to young entrepreneurs willing to work on their ideas instead of going to college—back when she was a teenager, in 2012. This set her up to attract attention from members of the tech elite as both customers and financial backers. Her company has raised $16.5 million to date from investors like Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, and Armstrong, the Coinbase CEO.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In August Siddiqui made the controversial suggestion that parents who choose not to use genetic testing might be considered irresponsible. “Just be honest: you’re okay with your kid potentially suffering for life so you can feel morally superior …” she wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Americans have varied opinions on the emerging technology. In 2024, a group of bioethicists surveyed 1,627 US adults to determine attitudes toward a variety of polygenic testing criteria. A large majority approved of testing for physical health conditions like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Screening for mental health disorders, like depression, OCD, and ADHD, drew a more mixed—but still positive—response. Appearance-related traits, like skin color, baldness, and height, received less approval as something to test for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Intelligence was among the most contentious traits—unsurprising given the way it has been weaponized throughout history and the lack of cultural consensus on how it should even be defined. (In many countries, intelligence testing for embryos is heavily regulated; in the UK, the practice is banned outright.) In the 2024 survey, 36.9% of respondents approved of preimplantation genetic testing for intelligence, 40.5% disapproved, and 22.6% said they were uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125500" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ND25-feature_baby.png?w=589" width="589" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the disagreement, intelligence has been among the traits most talked about as targets for testing. From early on, Genomic Prediction says, it began receiving inquiries “from all over the world” about testing for intelligence, according to Diego Marin, the company’s head of global business development and scientific affairs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At one time, the company offered a predictor for what it called “intellectual disability.” After some backlash questioning both the predictive capacity and the ethics of these scores, the company discontinued the feature. “Our mission and vision of this company is not to improve [a baby], but to reduce risk for disease,” Marin told me. “When it comes to traits about IQ or skin color or height or something that’s cosmetic and doesn’t really have a connotation of a disease, then we just don’t invest in it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Orchid, on the other hand, does test for genetic markers associated with intellectual disability and developmental delay. But that may not be all. According to one employee of the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, intelligence testing is also offered to “high-roller” clients. According to this employee, another source close to the company, and reporting in the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post,&lt;/em&gt; Musk used Orchid’s services in the conception of at least one of the children he shares with the tech executive Shivon Zilis. (Orchid, Musk, and Zilis did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I met Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder of New York–based Nucleus Genomics, on a sweltering July afternoon in his SoHo office. Slight and kinetic, Sadeghi spoke at a machine-gun pace, pausing only occasionally to ask if I was keeping up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi had modified his first organism—a sample of brewer’s yeast—at the age of 16. As a high schooler in 2016, he was taking a course on CRISPR-Cas9 at a Brooklyn laboratory when he fell in love with the “beautiful depth” of genetics. Just a few years later, he dropped out of college to build “a better 23andMe.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His company targets what you might call the application layer of PGT-P, accepting data from IVF clinics—and even from the competitors mentioned in this story—and running its own computational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Unlike a lot of the other testing companies, we’re software first, and we’re consumer first,” Sadeghi told me. “It’s not enough to give someone a polygenic score. What does that mean? How do you compare them? There’s so many really hard design problems.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like its competitors, Nucleus calculates its polygenic risk scores by comparing an individual’s genetic data with trait-associated variants identified in large GWASs, providing statistically informed predictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nucleus provides two displays of a patient’s results: a Z-score, plotted from –4 to 4, which explains the risk of a certain trait relative to a population with similar genetic ancestry (for example, if Embryo #3 has a 2.1 Z-score for breast cancer, its risk is higher than average), and an absolute risk score, which includes relevant clinical factors (Embryo #3 has a minuscule actual risk of breast cancer, given that it is male).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The real difference between Nucleus and its competitors lies in the breadth of what it claims to offer clients. On its sleek website, prospective parents can sort through more than 2,000 possible diseases, as well as traits from eye color to IQ. Access to the Nucleus Embryo platform costs $8,999, while the company’s new IVF+ offering—which includes one IVF cycle with a partner clinic, embryo screening for up to 20 embryos, and concierge services throughout the process—starts at $24,999.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Maybe you want your baby to have blue eyes versus green eyes,” Nucleus founder Kian Sadeghi said at a June event. “That is up to the liberty of the parents.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Its promises are remarkably bold. The company claims to be able to forecast a propensity for anxiety, ADHD, insomnia, and other mental issues. It says you can see which of your embryos are more likely to have alcohol dependence, which are more likely to be left-handed, and which might end up with severe acne or seasonal allergies. (Nevertheless, at the time of writing, the embryo-screening platform provided this disclaimer: “DNA is not destiny. Genetics can be a helpful tool for choosing an embryo, but it’s not a guarantee. Genetic research is still in it’s [sic] infancy, and there’s still a lot we don’t know about how DNA shapes who we are.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To people accustomed to sleep trackers, biohacking supplements, and glucose monitoring, taking advantage of Nucleus’s options might seem like a no-brainer. To anyone who welcomes a bit of serendipity in their life, this level of perceived control may be disconcerting to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi likes to frame his arguments in terms of personal choice. “Maybe you want your baby to have blue eyes versus green eyes,” he told a small audience at Nucleus Embryo’s June launch event. “That is up to the liberty of the parents.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the official launch day, Sadeghi spent hours gleefully sparring with X users who accused him of practicing eugenics. He rejects the term, favoring instead “genetic optimization”—though it seems he wasn’t too upset about the free viral marketing. “This week we got five million impressions on Twitter,” he told a crowd at the launch event, to a smattering of applause. (In an email to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review, &lt;/em&gt;Sadeghi wrote, “The history of eugenics is one of coercion and discrimination by states and institutions; what Nucleus does is the opposite—genetic forecasting that empowers individuals to make informed decisions.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nucleus has raised more than $36 million from investors like Srinivasan, Alexis Ohanian’s venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, and Thiel’s Founders Fund. (Like Siddiqui, Sadeghi was a recipient of a Thiel fellowship when he dropped out of college; a representative for Thiel did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) Sadeghi has even poached Genomic Prediction’s cofounder Nathan Treff, who is now Nucleus’s chief clinical officer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi’s real goal is to build a one-stop shop for every possible application of genetic sequencing technology, from genealogy to precision medicine to genetic engineering. He names a handful of companies providing these services, with a combined market cap in the billions. “Nucleus is collapsing all five of these companies into one,” he says. “We are not an IVF testing company. We are a genetic stack.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This spring, I elbowed my way into a packed hotel bar in the Flatiron district, where over a hundred people had gathered to hear a talk called “How to create SUPERBABIES.” The event was part of New York’s Deep Tech Week, so I expected to meet a smattering of biotech professionals and investors. Instead, I was surprised to encounter a diverse and curious group of creatives, software engineers, students, and prospective parents—many of whom had come with no previous knowledge of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The speaker that evening was Jonathan Anomaly, a soft-spoken political philosopher whose didactic tone betrays his years as a university professor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of Anomaly’s academic work has focused on developing theories of rational behavior. At Duke and the University of Pennsylvania, he led introductory courses on game theory, ethics, and collective action problems as well as bioethics, digging into thorny questions about abortion, vaccines, and euthanasia. But perhaps no topic has interested him so much as the emerging field of genetic enhancement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2018, in a bioethics journal, Anomaly published a paper with the intentionally provocative title “Defending Eugenics.” He sought to distinguish what he called “positive eugenics”—noncoercive methods aimed at increasing traits that “promote individual and social welfare”—from the so-called “negative eugenics” we know from our history books.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anomaly likes to argue that embryo selection isn’t all that different from practices we already take for granted. Don’t believe two cousins should be allowed to have children? Perhaps you’re a eugenicist, he contends. Your friend who picked out a six-foot-two Harvard grad from a binder of potential sperm donors? Same logic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His hiring at the University of Pennsylvania in 2019 caused outrage among some students, who accused him of “racial essentialism.” In 2020, Anomaly left academia, lamenting that “American universities had become an intellectual prison.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few years later, Anomaly joined a nascent PGT-P company named Herasight, which was promising to screen for IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the end of July, the company officially emerged from stealth mode. A representative told me that most of the money raised so far is from angel investors, including Srinivasan, who also invested in Orchid and Nucleus. According to the launch announcement on X, Herasight has screened “hundreds of embryos” for private customers and is beginning to offer its first publicly available consumer product, a polygenic assessment that claims to detect an embryo’s likelihood of developing 17 diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their marketing materials boast predictive abilities 122% better than Orchid’s and 193% better than Genomic Prediction’s for this set of diseases. (“Herasight is comparing their current predictor to models we published over five years ago,” Genomic Prediction responded in a statement. “Our team is confident our predictors are world-class and are not exceeded in quality by any other lab.”)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company did not include comparisons with Nucleus, pointing to the “absence of published performance validations” by that company and claiming it represented a case where “marketing outpaces science.” (“Nucleus is known for world-class science and marketing, and we understand why that’s frustrating to our competitors,” a representative from the company responded in a comment.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Herasight also emphasized new advances in “within-family validation” (making sure that the scores are not merely picking up shared environmental factors by comparing their performance between unrelated people to their performance between siblings) and “cross-­ancestry accuracy” (improving the accuracy of scores for people outside the European ancestry groups where most of the biobank data is concentrated). The representative explained that pricing varies by customer and the number of embryos tested, but it can reach $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to traits that Jonathan Anomaly believes are genetically encoded, intelligence is just the tip of the iceberg. He has also spoken about the heritability of empathy, violence, religiosity, and political leanings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Herasight tests for just one non-disease-related trait: intelligence. For a couple who produce 10 embryos, it claims it can detect an IQ spread of about 15 points, from the lowest-scoring embryo to the highest. The representative says the company plans to release a detailed white paper on its IQ predictor in the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The day of Herasight’s launch, Musk responded to the company announcement: “Cool.” Meanwhile, a Danish researcher named Emil Kirkegaard, whose research has largely focused on IQ differences between racial groups, boosted the company to his nearly 45,000 followers on X (as well as in a Substack blog), writing, “Proper embryo selection just landed.” Kirkegaard has in fact supported Anomaly’s work for years; he’s posted about him on X and recommended his 2020 book &lt;em&gt;Creating Future People,&lt;/em&gt; which he called a “biotech eugenics advocacy book,” adding: “Naturally, I agree with this stuff!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to traits that Anomaly believes are genetically encoded, intelligence—which he claimed in his talk is about 75% heritable—is just the tip of the iceberg. He has also spoken about the heritability of empathy, impulse control, violence, passivity, religiosity, and political leanings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anomaly concedes there are limitations to the kinds of relative predictions that can be made from a small batch of embryos. But he believes we’re only at the dawn of what he likes to call the “reproductive revolution.” At his talk, he pointed to a technology currently in development at a handful of startups: in vitro gametogenesis. IVG aims to create sperm or egg cells in a laboratory using adult stem cells, genetically reprogrammed from cells found in a sample of skin or blood. In theory, this process could allow a couple to quickly produce a practically unlimited number of embryos to analyze for preferred traits. Anomaly predicted this technology could be ready to use on humans within eight years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125510" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_3_1.jpg?w=1617" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I doubt the FDA will allow it immediately. That’s what places like Próspera are for,” he said, referring to the so-called “startup city” in Honduras, where scientists and entrepreneurs can conduct medical experiments free from the kinds of regulatory oversight they’d encounter in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You might have a moral intuition that this is wrong,” said Anomaly, “but when it’s discovered that elites are doing it privately … the dominoes are going to fall very, very quickly.” The coming “evolutionary arms race,” he claimed, will “change the moral landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He added that some of those elites are his own customers: “I could already name names, but I won’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After Anomaly’s talk was over, I spoke with a young photographer who told me he was hoping to pursue a master’s degree in theology. He came to the event, he told me, to reckon with the ethical implications of playing God. “Technology is sending us toward an Old-to-New-Testament transition moment, where we have to decide what parts of religion still serve us,” he said soberly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Criticisms of polygenic testing tend to fall into two camps: skepticism about the tests’ effectiveness and concerns about their ethics. “On one hand,” says Turley from the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium, “you have arguments saying ‘This isn’t going to work anyway, and the reason it’s bad is because we’re tricking parents, which would be a problem.’ And on the other hand, they say, ‘Oh, this is going to work so well that it’s going to lead to enormous inequalities in society.’ It’s just funny to see. Sometimes these arguments are being made by the same people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of those people is Sasha Gusev, who runs a quantitative genetics lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. A vocal critic of PGT-P for embryo selection, he also often engages in online debates with the far-right accounts promoting race science on X.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gusev is one of many professionals in his field who believe that because of numerous confounding socioeconomic factors—for example, childhood nutrition, geography, personal networks, and parenting styles—there isn’t much point in trying to trace outcomes like educational attainment back to genetics, particularly not as a way to prove that there’s a genetic basis for IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He adds, “I think there’s a real risk in moving toward a society where you see genetics and ‘genetic endowments’ as the drivers of people’s behavior and as a ceiling on their outcomes and their capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gusev thinks there is real promise for this technology in clinical settings among specific adult populations. For adults identified as having high polygenic risk scores for cancer and cardiovascular disease, he argues, a combination of early screening and intervention could be lifesaving. But when it comes to the preimplantation testing currently on the market, he thinks there are significant limitations—and few regulatory measures or long-term validation methods to check the promises companies are making. He fears that giving these services too much attention could backfire.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“These reckless, overpromised, and oftentimes just straight-up manipulative embryo selection applications are a risk for the credibility and the utility of these clinical tools,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many IVF patients have also had strong reactions to publicity around PGT-P. When the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published an opinion piece about Orchid in the spring, angry parents took to Reddit to rant. One user posted, “For people who dont [sic] know why other types of testing are necessary or needed this just makes IVF people sound like we want to create ‘perfect’ babies, while we just want (our) healthy babies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, others defended the need for a conversation. “When could technologies like this change the mission from helping infertile people have healthy babies to eugenics?” one Redditor posted. “It’s a fine line to walk and an important discussion to have.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some PGT-P proponents, like Kirkegaard and Anomaly, have argued that policy decisions should more explicitly account for genetic differences. In a series of blog posts following the 2024 presidential election, under the header “Make science great again,” Kirkegaard called for ending affirmative action laws, legalizing race-based hiring discrimination, and removing restrictions on data sets like the NIH’s All of Us biobank that prevent researchers like him from using the data for race science. Anomaly has criticized social welfare policies for putting a finger on the scale to “punish the high-IQ people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the notion of genetic determinism has gained some traction among loyalists to President Donald Trump.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, Trump himself made a campaign stop on the conservative radio program &lt;em&gt;The Hugh Hewitt Show. &lt;/em&gt;He began a rambling answer about immigration and homicide statistics. “A murderer, I believe this, it’s in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now,” he told the host.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gusev believes that while embryo selection won’t have much impact on individual outcomes, the intellectual framework endorsed by many PGT-P advocates could have dire social consequences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you just think of the differences that we observe in society as being cultural, then you help people out. You give them better schooling, you give them better nutrition and education, and they’re able to excel,” he says. “If you think of these differences as being strongly innate, then you can fool yourself into thinking that there’s nothing that can be done and people just are what they are at birth.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the time being, there are no plans for longitudinal studies to track &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; outcomes for the humans these companies have helped bring into the world. Harden, the behavioral geneticist from UT Austin, suspects that 25 years down the line, adults who were once embryos selected on the basis of polygenic risk scores are “going to end up with the same question that we all have.” They will look at their life and wonder, “What would’ve had to change for it to be different?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julia Black is a Brooklyn-based features writer and a reporter in residence at Omidyar Network.

You rely on the sun for power, heat your home with a woodstove, and farm your own fish and vegetables. The year is 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is the life of Marcin Jakubowski, the 53-year-old founder of Open Source Ecology, an open collaborative of engineers, producers, and builders developing what they call the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS). It’s a set of 50 machines—everything from a tractor to an oven to a circuit maker—that are capable of building civilization from scratch and can be reconfigured however you see fit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski immigrated to the US from Slupca, Poland, as a child. His first encounter with what he describes as the “prosperity of technology” was the vastness of the American grocery store. Seeing the sheer quantity and variety of perfectly ripe produce cemented his belief that abundant, sustainable living was within reach in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a bachelor’s degree from Princeton and a doctorate in physics from the University of Wisconsin, Jakubowski had spent most of his life in school. While his peers kick-started their shiny new corporate careers, he followed a different path after he finished his degree in 2003: He bought a tractor to start a farm in Maysville, Missouri, eager to prove his ideas about abundance. “It was a clear decision to give up the office cubicle or high-level research job, which is so focused on tiny issues that one never gets to work on the big picture,” he says. But in just a short few months, his tractor broke down—and he soon went broke.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Every time his tractor malfunctioned, he had no choice but to pay John Deere for repairs—even if he knew how to fix the problem on his own. John Deere, the world’s largest manufacturer of agricultural equipment, continues to prohibit farmers from repairing their own tractors (except in Colorado, where farmers were granted a right to repair by state law in 2023). Fixing your own tractor voids any insurance or warranty, much like jailbreaking your iPhone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, large agricultural manufacturers have centralized control over the market, and most commercial tractors are built with proprietary parts. Every year, farmers pay $1.2 billion in repair costs and lose an estimated $3 billion whenever their tractors break down, entirely because large agricultural manufacturers have lobbied against the right to repair since the ’90s. Currently there are class action lawsuits involving hundreds of farmers fighting for their right to do so.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The machines own farmers. The farmers don’t own [the machines],” Jakubowski says. He grew certain that self-sufficiency relied on agricultural autonomy, which could be achieved only through free access to technology. So he set out to apply the principles of open-source software to hardware. He figured that if farmers could have access to the instructions and materials required to build their own tractors, not only would they be able to repair them, but they’d also be able to customize the vehicles for their needs. Life-changing technology should be available to all, he thought, not controlled by a select few. So, with an understanding of mechanical engineering, Jakubowski built his own tractor and put all his schematics online on his platform Open Source Ecology.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That tractor Jakubowski built is designed to be taken apart. It’s a critical part of the GVCS, a collection of plug-and-play machines that can “build a thriving economy anywhere in the world … from scratch.” The GVCS includes a 3D printer, a self-contained hydraulic power unit called the Power Cube, and more, each designed to be reconfigured for multiple purposes. There’s even a GVCS micro-home. You can use the Power Cube to power a brick press, a sawmill, a car, a CNC mill, or a bioplastic extruder, and you can build wind turbines with the frames that are used in the home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski compares the GVCS to Lego blocks and cites the Linux ecosystem as his inspiration. In the same way that Linux’s source code is free to inspect, modify, and redistribute, all the instructions you need to build and repurpose a GVCS machine are freely accessible online. Jakubowski envisions a future in which the GVCS parallels the Linux infrastructure, with custom tools built to optimize agriculture, construction, and material fabrication in localized contexts. “The [final form of the GVCS] must be proven to allow efficient production of food, shelter, consumer goods, cars, fuel, and other goods—except for exotic imports (coffee, bananas, advanced semiconductors),” he wrote on his Open Source Ecology wiki.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ethos of GVCS is reminiscent of the &lt;em&gt;Whole Earth Catalog,&lt;/em&gt; a countercultural publication that offered a combination of reviews, DIY manuals, and survival guides between 1968 and 1972. Founded by Stewart Brand, the publication had the slogan “Access to tools” and was famous for promoting self-sufficiency. It heavily featured the work of R. Buckminster Fuller, an American architect known for his geodesic domes (lightweight structures that can be built using recycled materials) and for coining the term “ephemeralization,” which refers to the ability of technology to let us do more with less material, energy, and effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="plans for a lifetrac tractor" class="wp-image-1125481" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LifeTrac.jpg?w=995" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The schematics for Marcin Jakubowski's designs are all available online.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski owns the publication’s entire printed output, but he offers a sharp critique of its legacy in our current culture of tech utopianism. “The first structures we built were domes. Good ideas. But the open-source part of that was not really there yet—Fuller patented his stuff,” he says. Fuller and the &lt;em&gt;Whole Earth Catalog&lt;/em&gt; may have popularized an important philosophy of self-reliance, but to Jakubowski, their failure to advocate for open collaboration stopped the ultimate vision of sustainability from coming to fruition. “The failure of the techno-utopians to organize into a larger movement of collaborative, open, distributed production resulted in a miscarriage of techno-utopia,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="lifetrac tractor" class="wp-image-1125482" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lifetrac2.webp?w=2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;With a background in physics and an understanding of mechanical engineering, Marcin Jakubowski built his own tractor.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike software, hardware can’t be infinitely reproduced or instantly tested. It requires manufacturing infrastructure and specific materials, not to mention exhaustive documentation. There are physical constraints—different port standards, fluctuations in availability of materials, and more. And now that production chains are so globalized that manufacturing a hot tub can require parts from seven different countries and 14 states, how can we expect anything to be replicable in our backyard? The solution, according to Jakubowski, is to make technology “appropriate.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Appropriate technology is technology that’s designed to be affordable and sustainable for a specific local context. The idea comes from Gandhi’s philosophy of &lt;em&gt;swadeshi&lt;/em&gt; (self-reliance) and &lt;em&gt;sarvodaya&lt;/em&gt; (upliftment of all) and was popularized by the economist Ernst Friedrich “Fritz” Schumacher’s book &lt;em&gt;Small Is Beautiful,&lt;/em&gt; which discussed the concept of “intermediate technology”: “Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage—to move in the opposite direction.” Because different environments operate at different scales and with different resources, it only makes sense to tailor technology for those conditions. Solar lamps, bikes, hand-­powered water pumps—anything that can be built using local materials and maintained by the local community—are among the most widely cited examples of appropriate technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This concept has historically been discussed in the context of facilitating economic growth in developing nations and adapting capital-intensive technology to their needs. But Jakubowski hopes to make it universal. He believes technology needs to be appropriate even in suburban and urban places with access to supermarkets, hardware stores, Amazon deliveries, and other forms of infrastructure. If technology is designed specifically for these contexts, he says, end-to-end reproduction will be possible, making more space for collaboration and innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;What makes Jakubowski’s technology “appropriate” is his use of reclaimed materials and off-the-shelf parts to build his machines. By using local materials and widely available components, he’s able to bypass the complex global supply chains that proprietary technology often requires. He also structures his schematics around concepts already familiar to most people who are interested in hardware, making his building instructions easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Everything you need to build Jakubowski’s machines should be available around you, just as everything you need to know about how to repair or operate the machine is online—from blueprints to lists of materials to assembly instructions and testing protocols. “If you’ve got a wrench, you’ve got a tractor,” his manual reads.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This spirit dates back to the ’70s, when the idea of building things “moved out of the retired person’s garage and into the young person’s relationship with the Volkswagen,” says Brand. He references John Muir’s 1969 book &lt;em&gt;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot&lt;/em&gt; and fondly recalls how the Beetle’s simple design and easily swapped parts made it common for owners to rebody their cars, combining the chassis of one with the body of another. He also mentions the impact of the Ford Model T cars that, with a few extra parts, were made into tractors during the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Brand, the focus on repairability is critical in the modern context. There was a time when John Deere tractors were “appropriate” in Jakubowski’s terms, Brand says: “A century earlier, John Deere took great care to make sure that his plowshares could be taken apart and bolted together, that you can undo and redo them, replace parts, and so on.” The company “attracted insanely loyal customers because they looked out for the farmers so much,” Brand says, but “they’ve really reversed the orientation.” Echoing Jakubowski’s initial motivation for starting OSE, Brand insists that technology is appropriate to the extent that it is repairable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you can find all the parts you need from Lowe’s, building your own tractor is still intimidating. But for some, the staggering price advantage is reason enough to take on the challenge: A GVCS tractor costs $12,000 to build, whereas a commercial tractor averages around $120,000 to buy, not including the individual repairs that might be necessary over its lifetime at a cost of $500 to $20,000 each. And gargantuan though it may seem, the task of building a GVCS tractor or other machine is doable: Just a few years after the project launched in 2008, more than 110 machines had been built by enthusiasts from Chile, Nicaragua, Guatemala, China, India, Italy, and Turkey, just to name a few places.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of the many machines developed, what’s drawn the most interest from GVCS enthusiasts is the one nicknamed “The Liberator,” which presses local soil into compressed earth blocks, or CEBs—a type of cost- and energy-­efficient brick that can withstand extreme weather conditions. It’s been especially popular among those looking to build their own homes: A man named Aurélien Bielsa replicated the brick press in a small village in the south of France to build a house for his family in 2018, and in 2020 a group of volunteers helped a member of the Open Source Ecology community build a tiny home using blocks from one of these presses in a fishing village near northern Belize.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125480" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chrow.jpg?w=2554" width="2554" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The CEB press, nicknamed “The Liberator,” turns local soil into energy-efficient compressed earth blocks.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski recalls receiving an email about one of the first complete reproductions of the CEB press, built by a Texan named James Slate, who ended up starting a business selling the bricks: “When [James] sent me a picture [of our brick press], I thought it was a Photoshopped copy of our machine, but it was his. He just downloaded the plans off the internet. I knew nothing about it.” Slate described having a very limited background in engineering before building the brick press. “I had taken some mechanics classes back in high school. I mostly come from an IT computer world,” he said in an interview with Open Source Ecology. “Pretty much anyone can build one, if they put in the effort.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrew Spina, an early GVCS enthusiast, agrees. Spina spent five years building versions of the GVCS tractor and Power Cube, eager to create means of self-­sufficiency at an individual scale. “I’m building my own tractor because I want to understand it and be able to maintain it,” he wrote in his blog, &lt;em&gt;Machining Independence.&lt;/em&gt; Spina’s curiosity gestures toward the broader issue of technological literacy: The more we outsource to proprietary tech, the less we understand how things work—further entrenching our need for that proprietary tech. Transparency is critical to the open-source philosophy precisely because it helps us become self-sufficient.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Since starting Open Source Ecology, Jakubowski has been the main architect behind the dozens of machines available on his platform, testing and refining his designs on a plot of land he calls the Factor&amp;nbsp;e Farm in Maysville. Most GVCS enthusiasts reproduce Jakubowski’s machines for personal use; only a few have contributed to the set themselves. Of those select few, many made dedicated visits to the farm for weeks at a time to learn how to build Jakubowski’s GVCS collection. James Wise, one of the earliest and longest-term GVCS contributors, recalls setting up tents and camping out in his car to attend sessions at Jakubowski’s workshop, where visiting enthusiasts would gather to iterate on designs: “We’d have a screen on the wall of our current best idea. Then we’d talk about it.” Wise doesn’t consider himself particularly experienced on the engineering front, but after working with other visiting participants, he felt more emboldened to contribute. “Most of [my] knowledge came from [my] peers,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski’s goal of bolstering collaboration hinges on a degree of collective proficiency. Without a community skilled with hardware, the organic innovation that the open-source approach promises will struggle to bear fruit, even if Jakubowski’s designs are perfectly appropriate and thoroughly documented.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“That’s why we’re starting a school!” said Jakubowski, when asked about his plan to build hardware literacy. Earlier this year, he announced the Future Builders Academy, an apprenticeship program where participants will be taught all the necessary skills to develop and build the affordable, self-sustaining homes that are his newest venture. Seed Eco Homes, as Jakubowski calls them, are “human-sized, panelized” modular houses complete with a biodigester, a thermal battery, a geothermal cooling system, and solar electricity. Each house is entirely energy independent and can be built in five days, at a cost of around $40,000. Over eight of these houses have been built across the country, and Jakubowski himself lives in the earliest version of the design. Seed Eco Homes are the culmination of his work on the GVCS: The structure of each house combines parts from the collection and embodies its modular philosophy. The venture represents Jakubowski’s larger goal of making everyday technology accessible. “Housing [is the] single largest cost in one’s life—and a key to so much more,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The final goal of Open Source Ecology is a “zero marginal cost” society, where producing an additional unit of a good or service costs little to nothing. Jakubowski’s interpretation of the concept (popularized by the American economist and social theorist Jeremy Rifkin) assumes that by eradicating licensing fees, decentralizing manufacturing, and fostering collaboration through education, we can develop truly equitable technology that allows us to be self-sufficient. Open-source hardware isn’t just about helping farmers build their own tractors; in Jakubowski’s view, it’s a complete reorientation of our relationship to technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first issue of the &lt;em&gt;Whole Earth Catalog,&lt;/em&gt; a key piece of inspiration for Jakubowski’s project, Brand wrote: “We are as gods and we might as well get good at it.” In 2007, in a book Brand wrote about the publication, he corrected himself: “We are as gods and &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to get good at it.” Today, Jakubowski elaborates: “We’re becoming gods with technology. Yet technology has badly failed us. We’ve seen great progress with civilization. But how free are people today compared to other times?” Cautioning against our reliance on the proprietary technology we use daily, he offers a new approach: Progress should mean not just achieving technological breakthroughs but also making everyday technology equitable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t need more technology,” he says. “We just need to collaborate with what we have now.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiffany Ng is a freelance writer exploring the relationship between art, tech, and culture.

Buckminster Fuller, an American architect known for his geodesic domes (lightweight structures that can be built using recycled materials) and for coining the term “ephemeralization,” which refers to the ability of technology to let us do more with less material, energy, and effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="plans for a lifetrac tractor" class="wp-image-1125481" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LifeTrac.jpg?w=995" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The schematics for Marcin Jakubowski's designs are all available online.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski owns the publication’s entire printed output, but he offers a sharp critique of its legacy in our current culture of tech utopianism. “The first structures we built were domes. Good ideas. But the open-source part of that was not really there yet—Fuller patented his stuff,” he says. Fuller and the &lt;em&gt;Whole Earth Catalog&lt;/em&gt; may have popularized an important philosophy of self-reliance, but to Jakubowski, their failure to advocate for open collaboration stopped the ultimate vision of sustainability from coming to fruition. “The failure of the techno-utopians to organize into a larger movement of collaborative, open, distributed production resulted in a miscarriage of techno-utopia,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="lifetrac tractor" class="wp-image-1125482" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lifetrac2.webp?w=2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;With a background in physics and an understanding of mechanical engineering, Marcin Jakubowski built his own tractor.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike software, hardware can’t be infinitely reproduced or instantly tested. It requires manufacturing infrastructure and specific materials, not to mention exhaustive documentation. There are physical constraints—different port standards, fluctuations in availability of materials, and more. And now that production chains are so globalized that manufacturing a hot tub can require parts from seven different countries and 14 states, how can we expect anything to be replicable in our backyard? The solution, according to Jakubowski, is to make technology “appropriate.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Appropriate technology is technology that’s designed to be affordable and sustainable for a specific local context. The idea comes from Gandhi’s philosophy of &lt;em&gt;swadeshi&lt;/em&gt; (self-reliance) and &lt;em&gt;sarvodaya&lt;/em&gt; (upliftment of all) and was popularized by the economist Ernst Friedrich “Fritz” Schumacher’s book &lt;em&gt;Small Is Beautiful,&lt;/em&gt; which discussed the concept of “intermediate technology”: “Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage—to move in the opposite direction.” Because different environments operate at different scales and with different resources, it only makes sense to tailor technology for those conditions. Solar lamps, bikes, hand-­powered water pumps—anything that can be built using local materials and maintained by the local community—are among the most widely cited examples of appropriate technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This concept has historically been discussed in the context of facilitating economic growth in developing nations and adapting capital-intensive technology to their needs. But Jakubowski hopes to make it universal. He believes technology needs to be appropriate even in suburban and urban places with access to supermarkets, hardware stores, Amazon deliveries, and other forms of infrastructure. If technology is designed specifically for these contexts, he says, end-to-end reproduction will be possible, making more space for collaboration and innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;What makes Jakubowski’s technology “appropriate” is his use of reclaimed materials and off-the-shelf parts to build his machines. By using local materials and widely available components, he’s able to bypass the complex global supply chains that proprietary technology often requires. He also structures his schematics around concepts already familiar to most people who are interested in hardware, making his building instructions easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Everything you need to build Jakubowski’s machines should be available around you, just as everything you need to know about how to repair or operate the machine is online—from blueprints to lists of materials to assembly instructions and testing protocols. “If you’ve got a wrench, you’ve got a tractor,” his manual reads.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This spirit dates back to the ’70s, when the idea of building things “moved out of the retired person’s garage and into the young person’s relationship with the Volkswagen,” says Brand. He references John Muir’s 1969 book &lt;em&gt;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot&lt;/em&gt; and fondly recalls how the Beetle’s simple design and easily swapped parts made it common for owners to rebody their cars, combining the chassis of one with the body of another. He also mentions the impact of the Ford Model T cars that, with a few extra parts, were made into tractors during the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Brand, the focus on repairability is critical in the modern context. There was a time when John Deere tractors were “appropriate” in Jakubowski’s terms, Brand says: “A century earlier, John Deere took great care to make sure that his plowshares could be taken apart and bolted together, that you can undo and redo them, replace parts, and so on.” The company “attracted insanely loyal customers because they looked out for the farmers so much,” Brand says, but “they’ve really reversed the orientation.” Echoing Jakubowski’s initial motivation for starting OSE, Brand insists that technology is appropriate to the extent that it is repairable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you can find all the parts you need from Lowe’s, building your own tractor is still intimidating. But for some, the staggering price advantage is reason enough to take on the challenge: A GVCS tractor costs $12,000 to build, whereas a commercial tractor averages around $120,000 to buy, not including the individual repairs that might be necessary over its lifetime at a cost of $500 to $20,000 each. And gargantuan though it may seem, the task of building a GVCS tractor or other machine is doable: Just a few years after the project launched in 2008, more than 110 machines had been built by enthusiasts from Chile, Nicaragua, Guatemala, China, India, Italy, and Turkey, just to name a few places.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of the many machines developed, what’s drawn the most interest from GVCS enthusiasts is the one nicknamed “The Liberator,” which presses local soil into compressed earth blocks, or CEBs—a type of cost- and energy-­efficient brick that can withstand extreme weather conditions. It’s been especially popular among those looking to build their own homes: A man named Aurélien Bielsa replicated the brick press in a small village in the south of France to build a house for his family in 2018, and in 2020 a group of volunteers helped a member of the Open Source Ecology community build a tiny home using blocks from one of these presses in a fishing village near northern Belize.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125480" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chrow.jpg?w=2554" width="2554" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The CEB press, nicknamed “The Liberator,” turns local soil into energy-efficient compressed earth blocks.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski recalls receiving an email about one of the first complete reproductions of the CEB press, built by a Texan named James Slate, who ended up starting a business selling the bricks: “When [James] sent me a picture [of our brick press], I thought it was a Photoshopped copy of our machine, but it was his. He just downloaded the plans off the internet. I knew nothing about it.” Slate described having a very limited background in engineering before building the brick press. “I had taken some mechanics classes back in high school. I mostly come from an IT computer world,” he said in an interview with Open Source Ecology. “Pretty much anyone can build one, if they put in the effort.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrew Spina, an early GVCS enthusiast, agrees. Spina spent five years building versions of the GVCS tractor and Power Cube, eager to create means of self-­sufficiency at an individual scale. “I’m building my own tractor because I want to understand it and be able to maintain it,” he wrote in his blog, &lt;em&gt;Machining Independence.&lt;/em&gt; Spina’s curiosity gestures toward the broader issue of technological literacy: The more we outsource to proprietary tech, the less we understand how things work—further entrenching our need for that proprietary tech. Transparency is critical to the open-source philosophy precisely because it helps us become self-sufficient.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Since starting Open Source Ecology, Jakubowski has been the main architect behind the dozens of machines available on his platform, testing and refining his designs on a plot of land he calls the Factor&amp;nbsp;e Farm in Maysville. Most GVCS enthusiasts reproduce Jakubowski’s machines for personal use; only a few have contributed to the set themselves. Of those select few, many made dedicated visits to the farm for weeks at a time to learn how to build Jakubowski’s GVCS collection. James Wise, one of the earliest and longest-term GVCS contributors, recalls setting up tents and camping out in his car to attend sessions at Jakubowski’s workshop, where visiting enthusiasts would gather to iterate on designs: “We’d have a screen on the wall of our current best idea. Then we’d talk about it.” Wise doesn’t consider himself particularly experienced on the engineering front, but after working with other visiting participants, he felt more emboldened to contribute. “Most of [my] knowledge came from [my] peers,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski’s goal of bolstering collaboration hinges on a degree of collective proficiency. Without a community skilled with hardware, the organic innovation that the open-source approach promises will struggle to bear fruit, even if Jakubowski’s designs are perfectly appropriate and thoroughly documented.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“That’s why we’re starting a school!” said Jakubowski, when asked about his plan to build hardware literacy. Earlier this year, he announced the Future Builders Academy, an apprenticeship program where participants will be taught all the necessary skills to develop and build the affordable, self-sustaining homes that are his newest venture. Seed Eco Homes, as Jakubowski calls them, are “human-sized, panelized” modular houses complete with a biodigester, a thermal battery, a geothermal cooling system, and solar electricity. Each house is entirely energy independent and can be built in five days, at a cost of around $40,000. Over eight of these houses have been built across the country, and Jakubowski himself lives in the earliest version of the design. Seed Eco Homes are the culmination of his work on the GVCS: The structure of each house combines parts from the collection and embodies its modular philosophy. The venture represents Jakubowski’s larger goal of making everyday technology accessible. “Housing [is the] single largest cost in one’s life—and a key to so much more,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The final goal of Open Source Ecology is a “zero marginal cost” society, where producing an additional unit of a good or service costs little to nothing. Jakubowski’s interpretation of the concept (popularized by the American economist and social theorist Jeremy Rifkin) assumes that by eradicating licensing fees, decentralizing manufacturing, and fostering collaboration through education, we can develop truly equitable technology that allows us to be self-sufficient. Open-source hardware isn’t just about helping farmers build their own tractors; in Jakubowski’s view, it’s a complete reorientation of our relationship to technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first issue of the &lt;em&gt;Whole Earth Catalog,&lt;/em&gt; a key piece of inspiration for Jakubowski’s project, Brand wrote: “We are as gods and we might as well get good at it.” In 2007, in a book Brand wrote about the publication, he corrected himself: “We are as gods and &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to get good at it.” Today, Jakubowski elaborates: “We’re becoming gods with technology. Yet technology has badly failed us. We’ve seen great progress with civilization. But how free are people today compared to other times?” Cautioning against our reliance on the proprietary technology we use daily, he offers a new approach: Progress should mean not just achieving technological breakthroughs but also making everyday technology equitable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t need more technology,” he says. “We just need to collaborate with what we have now.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiffany Ng is a freelance writer exploring the relationship between art, tech, and culture.

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a consequential act of quiet regulation. Cloudflare, a web infrastructure company, has updated millions of websites' robots.txt files in an effort to force Google to change how it crawls them to fuel its AI products and initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince about what exactly is going on here, why it matters, and what the web might soon look like. But to get into that, we need to cover a little background first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new change, which Cloudflare calls its Content Signals Policy, happened after publishers and other companies that depend on web traffic have cried foul over Google's AI Overviews and similar AI answer engines, saying they are sharply cutting those companies' path to revenue because they don't send traffic back to the source of the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been lawsuits, efforts to kick-start new marketplaces to ensure compensation, and more—but few companies have the kind of leverage Cloudflare does. Its products and services back something close to 20 percent of the web, and thus a significant slice of the websites that show up on search results pages or that fuel large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Almost every reasonable AI company that's out there is saying, listen, if it's a fair playing field, then we're happy to pay for content," Prince said. "The problem is that all of them are terrified of Google because if Google gets content for free but they all have to pay for it, they are always going to be at an inherent disadvantage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is happening because Google is using its dominant position in search to ensure that web publishers allow their content to be used in ways that they might not otherwise want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The changing norms of the web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2023, Google has offered a way for website administrators to opt their content out of use for training Google's large language models, such as Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, allowing pages to be indexed by Google's search crawlers and shown in results requires accepting that they'll also be used to generate AI Overviews at the top of results pages through a process called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;That's not so for many other crawlers, making Google an outlier among major players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sore point for a wide range of website administrators, from news websites that publish journalism to investment banks that produce research reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A July study from the Pew Research Center analyzed data from 900 adults in the US and found that AI Overviews cut referrals nearly in half. Specifically, users clicked a link on a page with AI Overviews at the top just 8 percent of the time, compared to 15 percent for search engine results pages without those summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a report in The Wall Street Journal cited a wide range of sources—including internal traffic metrics from numerous major publications like The New York Times and Business Insider—to describe industry-wide plummets in website traffic that those publishers said were tied to AI summaries, leading to layoffs and strategic shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Google's head of search, Liz Reid, disputed the validity and applicability of studies and publisher reports of reduced link clicks in search. "Overall, total organic click volume from Google Search to websites has been relatively stable year-over-year," she wrote, going on to say that reports of big declines were "often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the rollout of AI features in Search."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers aren't convinced. Penske Media Corporation, which owns brands like The Hollywood Reporter and Rolling Stone, sued Google over AI Overviews in September. The suit claims that affiliate link revenue has dropped by more than a third in the past year, due in large part to Google's overviews—a threatening shortfall in a business that already has difficult margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penske's suit specifically noted that because Google bundles traditional search engine indexing and RAG use together, the company has no choice but to allow Google to keep summarizing its articles, as cutting off Google search referrals entirely would be financially fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the earliest days of digital publishing, referrals have in one way or another acted as the backbone of the web's economy. Content could be made available freely to both human readers and crawlers, and norms were applied across the web to allow information to be tracked back to its source and give that source an opportunity to monetize its content to sustain itself.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Today, there's a panic that the old system isn't working anymore as content summaries via RAG have become more common, and along with other players, Cloudflare is trying to update those norms to reflect the current reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A mass-scale update to robots.txt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced on September 24, Cloudflare's Content Signals Policy is an effort to use the company's influential market position to change how content is used by web crawlers. It involves updating millions of websites' robots.txt files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 1994, websites began placing a file called "robots.txt" at the domain root to indicate to automated web crawlers which parts of the domain should be crawled and indexed and which should be ignored. The standard became near-universal over the years; honoring it has been a key part of how Google's web crawlers operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, robots.txt simply includes a list of paths on the domain that were flagged as either "allow" or "disallow." It was technically not enforceable, but it became an effective honor system because there are advantages to it for the owners of both the website and the crawler: Website owners could dictate access for various business reasons, and it helped crawlers avoid working through data that wouldn't be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But robots.txt only tells crawlers whether they can access something at all; it doesn't tell them what they can use it for. For example, Google supports disallowing the agent "Google-Extended" as a path to blocking crawlers that are looking for content with which to train future versions of its Gemini large language model—though introducing that rule doesn't do anything about the training Google did before it rolled out Google-Extended in 2023, and it doesn't stop crawling for RAG and AI Overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Content Signals Policy initiative is a newly proposed format for robots.txt that intends to do that. It allows website operators to opt in or out of consenting to the following use cases, as worded in the policy:&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;search: Building a search index and providing search results (e.g., returning hyperlinks and short excerpts from your website's contents). Search does not include providing AI-generated search summaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ai-input: Inputting content into one or more AI models (e.g., retrieval augmented generation, grounding, or other real-time taking of content for generative AI search answers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ai-train: Training or fine-tuning AI models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has given all of its customers quick paths for setting those values on a case-by-case basis. Further, it has automatically updated robots.txt on the 3.8 million domains that already use Cloudflare's managed robots.txt feature, with search defaulting to yes, ai-train to no, and ai-input blank, indicating a neutral position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The threat of potential litigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making this look a bit like a terms of service agreement, Cloudflare's goal is explicitly to put legal pressure on Google to change its policy of bundling traditional search crawlers and AI Overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Make no mistake, the legal team at Google is looking at this saying, 'Huh, that's now something that we have to actively choose to ignore across a significant portion of the web,'" Prince told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Cloudflare specifically made this look like a license agreement.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further characterized this as an effort to get a company that he says has historically been "largely a good actor" and a "patron of the web" to go back to doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Inside of Google, there is a fight where there are people who are saying we should change how we're doing this," he explained. "And there are other people saying, no, that gives up our inherent advantage, we have a God-given right to all the content on the Internet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid that debate, lawyers have sway at Google, so Cloudflare tried to design tools "that made it very clear that if they were going to follow any of these sites, there was a clear license which was in place for them. And that will create risk for them if they don't follow it," Prince said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;The next web paradigm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a company with Cloudflare's scale to do something like this with any hope that it will have an impact. If just a few websites made this change, Google would have an easier time ignoring it, or worse yet, it could simply stop crawling them to avoid the problem. Since Cloudflare is entangled with millions of websites, Google couldn't do that without materially impacting the quality of the search experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has a vested interest in the general health of the web, but there are other strategic considerations at play, too. The company has been working on tools to assist with RAG on customers' websites in partnership with Microsoft-owned Google competitor Bing and has experimented with a marketplace that provides a way for websites to charge crawlers for scraping the sites for AI, though what final form that might take is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Prince directly if this comes from a place of conviction. "There are very few times that opportunities come along where you get to help think through what a future better business model of an organization or institution as large as the Internet and as important as the Internet is," he said. "As we do that, I think that we should all be thinking about what have we learned that was good about the Internet in the past and what have we learned that was bad about the Internet in the past."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to acknowledge that we don't yet know what the future business model of the web will look like. Cloudflare itself has ideas. Others have proposed new standards, marketplaces, and strategies, too. There will be winners and losers, and those won't always be the same winners and losers we saw in the previous paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most people seem to agree on, whatever their individual incentives, is that Google shouldn't get to come out on top in a future answer-engine-driven web paradigm just because it previously established dominance in the search-engine-driven one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this new standard for robots.txt, success looks like Google allowing content to be available in search but not in AI Overviews. Whatever the long-term vision, and whether it happens because of Cloudflare's pressure with the Content Signals Policy or some other driving force, most agree that it would be a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a consequential act of quiet regulation. Cloudflare, a web infrastructure company, has updated millions of websites' robots.txt files in an effort to force Google to change how it crawls them to fuel its AI products and initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince about what exactly is going on here, why it matters, and what the web might soon look like. But to get into that, we need to cover a little background first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new change, which Cloudflare calls its Content Signals Policy, happened after publishers and other companies that depend on web traffic have cried foul over Google's AI Overviews and similar AI answer engines, saying they are sharply cutting those companies' path to revenue because they don't send traffic back to the source of the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been lawsuits, efforts to kick-start new marketplaces to ensure compensation, and more—but few companies have the kind of leverage Cloudflare does. Its products and services back something close to 20 percent of the web, and thus a significant slice of the websites that show up on search results pages or that fuel large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Almost every reasonable AI company that's out there is saying, listen, if it's a fair playing field, then we're happy to pay for content," Prince said. "The problem is that all of them are terrified of Google because if Google gets content for free but they all have to pay for it, they are always going to be at an inherent disadvantage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is happening because Google is using its dominant position in search to ensure that web publishers allow their content to be used in ways that they might not otherwise want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The changing norms of the web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2023, Google has offered a way for website administrators to opt their content out of use for training Google's large language models, such as Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, allowing pages to be indexed by Google's search crawlers and shown in results requires accepting that they'll also be used to generate AI Overviews at the top of results pages through a process called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;That's not so for many other crawlers, making Google an outlier among major players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sore point for a wide range of website administrators, from news websites that publish journalism to investment banks that produce research reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A July study from the Pew Research Center analyzed data from 900 adults in the US and found that AI Overviews cut referrals nearly in half. Specifically, users clicked a link on a page with AI Overviews at the top just 8 percent of the time, compared to 15 percent for search engine results pages without those summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a report in The Wall Street Journal cited a wide range of sources—including internal traffic metrics from numerous major publications like The New York Times and Business Insider—to describe industry-wide plummets in website traffic that those publishers said were tied to AI summaries, leading to layoffs and strategic shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Google's head of search, Liz Reid, disputed the validity and applicability of studies and publisher reports of reduced link clicks in search. "Overall, total organic click volume from Google Search to websites has been relatively stable year-over-year," she wrote, going on to say that reports of big declines were "often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the rollout of AI features in Search."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers aren't convinced. Penske Media Corporation, which owns brands like The Hollywood Reporter and Rolling Stone, sued Google over AI Overviews in September. The suit claims that affiliate link revenue has dropped by more than a third in the past year, due in large part to Google's overviews—a threatening shortfall in a business that already has difficult margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penske's suit specifically noted that because Google bundles traditional search engine indexing and RAG use together, the company has no choice but to allow Google to keep summarizing its articles, as cutting off Google search referrals entirely would be financially fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the earliest days of digital publishing, referrals have in one way or another acted as the backbone of the web's economy. Content could be made available freely to both human readers and crawlers, and norms were applied across the web to allow information to be tracked back to its source and give that source an opportunity to monetize its content to sustain itself.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Today, there's a panic that the old system isn't working anymore as content summaries via RAG have become more common, and along with other players, Cloudflare is trying to update those norms to reflect the current reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A mass-scale update to robots.txt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced on September 24, Cloudflare's Content Signals Policy is an effort to use the company's influential market position to change how content is used by web crawlers. It involves updating millions of websites' robots.txt files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 1994, websites began placing a file called "robots.txt" at the domain root to indicate to automated web crawlers which parts of the domain should be crawled and indexed and which should be ignored. The standard became near-universal over the years; honoring it has been a key part of how Google's web crawlers operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, robots.txt simply includes a list of paths on the domain that were flagged as either "allow" or "disallow." It was technically not enforceable, but it became an effective honor system because there are advantages to it for the owners of both the website and the crawler: Website owners could dictate access for various business reasons, and it helped crawlers avoid working through data that wouldn't be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But robots.txt only tells crawlers whether they can access something at all; it doesn't tell them what they can use it for. For example, Google supports disallowing the agent "Google-Extended" as a path to blocking crawlers that are looking for content with which to train future versions of its Gemini large language model—though introducing that rule doesn't do anything about the training Google did before it rolled out Google-Extended in 2023, and it doesn't stop crawling for RAG and AI Overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Content Signals Policy initiative is a newly proposed format for robots.txt that intends to do that. It allows website operators to opt in or out of consenting to the following use cases, as worded in the policy:&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;search: Building a search index and providing search results (e.g., returning hyperlinks and short excerpts from your website's contents). Search does not include providing AI-generated search summaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ai-input: Inputting content into one or more AI models (e.g., retrieval augmented generation, grounding, or other real-time taking of content for generative AI search answers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ai-train: Training or fine-tuning AI models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has given all of its customers quick paths for setting those values on a case-by-case basis. Further, it has automatically updated robots.txt on the 3.8 million domains that already use Cloudflare's managed robots.txt feature, with search defaulting to yes, ai-train to no, and ai-input blank, indicating a neutral position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The threat of potential litigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making this look a bit like a terms of service agreement, Cloudflare's goal is explicitly to put legal pressure on Google to change its policy of bundling traditional search crawlers and AI Overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Make no mistake, the legal team at Google is looking at this saying, 'Huh, that's now something that we have to actively choose to ignore across a significant portion of the web,'" Prince told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Cloudflare specifically made this look like a license agreement.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further characterized this as an effort to get a company that he says has historically been "largely a good actor" and a "patron of the web" to go back to doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Inside of Google, there is a fight where there are people who are saying we should change how we're doing this," he explained. "And there are other people saying, no, that gives up our inherent advantage, we have a God-given right to all the content on the Internet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid that debate, lawyers have sway at Google, so Cloudflare tried to design tools "that made it very clear that if they were going to follow any of these sites, there was a clear license which was in place for them. And that will create risk for them if they don't follow it," Prince said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;The next web paradigm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a company with Cloudflare's scale to do something like this with any hope that it will have an impact. If just a few websites made this change, Google would have an easier time ignoring it, or worse yet, it could simply stop crawling them to avoid the problem. Since Cloudflare is entangled with millions of websites, Google couldn't do that without materially impacting the quality of the search experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has a vested interest in the general health of the web, but there are other strategic considerations at play, too. The company has been working on tools to assist with RAG on customers' websites in partnership with Microsoft-owned Google competitor Bing and has experimented with a marketplace that provides a way for websites to charge crawlers for scraping the sites for AI, though what final form that might take is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Prince directly if this comes from a place of conviction. "There are very few times that opportunities come along where you get to help think through what a future better business model of an organization or institution as large as the Internet and as important as the Internet is," he said. "As we do that, I think that we should all be thinking about what have we learned that was good about the Internet in the past and what have we learned that was bad about the Internet in the past."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to acknowledge that we don't yet know what the future business model of the web will look like. Cloudflare itself has ideas. Others have proposed new standards, marketplaces, and strategies, too. There will be winners and losers, and those won't always be the same winners and losers we saw in the previous paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most people seem to agree on, whatever their individual incentives, is that Google shouldn't get to come out on top in a future answer-engine-driven web paradigm just because it previously established dominance in the search-engine-driven one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this new standard for robots.txt, success looks like Google allowing content to be available in search but not in AI Overviews. Whatever the long-term vision, and whether it happens because of Cloudflare's pressure with the Content Signals Policy or some other driving force, most agree that it would be a good start.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

Listings are posted and re-posted across different platforms as applications go unanswered, creating a spam-like flood of activity on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you put a job on LinkedIn, you might get 1,000 people applying for that job within the first six hours,” says Matt Wilson, a London-based serial entrepreneur. “Some companies don’t even review the applicants that apply for those jobs, because the signal to noise ratio is very, very low.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wilson’s new solution is Jack &amp;amp; Jill, a new platform that uses conversational AI to reinvent the recruitment process from the ground up. The company announced $20 million in seed funding today, led by EU investor Creandum, but it’s hardly been in stealth. Service is already live in London, where the outfit has garnered nearly 50,000 users — and Wilson wants to use the influx of cash to fuel a US expansion and take Jack &amp;amp; Jill to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There hasn’t been a major change in how people find jobs since LinkedIn and Indeed came on the scene 20 years ago,” says Wilson. His bet is that, with AI chatbots changing workplaces across the world, now might be the time to shake things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As you might guess from the name, Jack &amp;amp; Jill is a two-part platform. The “Jack” side of the platform handles the applicant side, giving users a 20-minute, AI-powered profile interview before providing them with a select list of roles pulled from online databases. From there, Jack can be used for mock interviews or more involved professional coaching. “Jill” works with employers, building a profile of a particular role and elevating candidates that match its requirements. Like LinkedIn, part of the goal is for both workers and hiring managers to keep an active presence on their respective apps, letting the app pull players off the sidelines as needed. The service takes a standard commission from any successful hire, and as the scope of the platform grows, Wilson hopes to make Jack &amp;amp; Jill indispensable for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That might sound like a standard recruiting system with a little AI sprinkled on top, but Wilson thinks conversational chatbots are more important than a simple matching algorithm. By building the process around chatbot interviews, he believes he’s found a scalable alternative to the endless shuffle of listings and resumes, potentially reinventing the basic elements of the contemporary hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using AI systems to conduct first-round interviews is increasingly common in many parts of the world — particularly in China, where many multinational corporations have used the practice for hiring local roles. But while a surprise interview with an AI hiring manager might seem alienating, Wilson hopes that Jack &amp;amp; Jill’s approach will result in more intelligence applied to job placement overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think the way that we are mapped to the companies we work for, and vice versa, is just extremely inefficient,” Wilson says. “There are billions of people out there that could be in better jobs for them. And that’s a mission worth working on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this piece was published with an erroneous figure in the headline. TechCrunch regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Headshot-–-Matthew-Wilson-Saaras-Mehan-Jack-Jill.jpg?resize=1200,859" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Between infinitely scrolling job boards and the puzzling rise of fake applicants using AI to apply en masse, job-searching has quickly become one of the most bewildering experiences the internet has to offer. Listings are posted and re-posted across different platforms as applications go unanswered, creating a spam-like flood of activity on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you put a job on LinkedIn, you might get 1,000 people applying for that job within the first six hours,” says Matt Wilson, a London-based serial entrepreneur. “Some companies don’t even review the applicants that apply for those jobs, because the signal to noise ratio is very, very low.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wilson’s new solution is Jack &amp;amp; Jill, a new platform that uses conversational AI to reinvent the recruitment process from the ground up. The company announced $20 million in seed funding today, led by EU investor Creandum, but it’s hardly been in stealth. Service is already live in London, where the outfit has garnered nearly 50,000 users — and Wilson wants to use the influx of cash to fuel a US expansion and take Jack &amp;amp; Jill to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There hasn’t been a major change in how people find jobs since LinkedIn and Indeed came on the scene 20 years ago,” says Wilson. His bet is that, with AI chatbots changing workplaces across the world, now might be the time to shake things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As you might guess from the name, Jack &amp;amp; Jill is a two-part platform. The “Jack” side of the platform handles the applicant side, giving users a 20-minute, AI-powered profile interview before providing them with a select list of roles pulled from online databases. From there, Jack can be used for mock interviews or more involved professional coaching. “Jill” works with employers, building a profile of a particular role and elevating candidates that match its requirements. Like LinkedIn, part of the goal is for both workers and hiring managers to keep an active presence on their respective apps, letting the app pull players off the sidelines as needed. The service takes a standard commission from any successful hire, and as the scope of the platform grows, Wilson hopes to make Jack &amp;amp; Jill indispensable for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That might sound like a standard recruiting system with a little AI sprinkled on top, but Wilson thinks conversational chatbots are more important than a simple matching algorithm. By building the process around chatbot interviews, he believes he’s found a scalable alternative to the endless shuffle of listings and resumes, potentially reinventing the basic elements of the contemporary hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using AI systems to conduct first-round interviews is increasingly common in many parts of the world — particularly in China, where many multinational corporations have used the practice for hiring local roles. But while a surprise interview with an AI hiring manager might seem alienating, Wilson hopes that Jack &amp;amp; Jill’s approach will result in more intelligence applied to job placement overall.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with Big Tech’s favorite carbon removal tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sucking carbon pollution out of the atmosphere is becoming a big business—companies are paying top dollar for technologies that can cancel out their own emissions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tech giants like Microsoft are betting big on one technology: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). But there are a few potential problems with BECCS, as my colleague James Temple laid out in a new story. And some of the concerns echo similar problems with other climate technologies we cover, like carbon offsets and alternative jet fuels.

In those spots, three conditions naturally align: high temperatures, plentiful water, and rock that’s permeable enough for fluids to circulate through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced geothermal systems aim to replicate those conditions in far more places—producing a steady supply of renewable energy wherever they’re deployed. Fervo Energy uses fracking techniques to create geothermal reservoirs capable of delivering enough electricity to power massive data centers and hundreds of thousands of homes.
