But out of its 160,000 active users, it may be its CEO, Nick Lahoika, who best embodies its mission.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lahoika was born in Belarus, didn’t speak English until his relocation to Estonia, and once struggled with speaking anxiety. Yet, he went on to “win a lot of pitch competitions” on behalf of the voice coaching startup, which was inspired by his journey, he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When I was at school, I was a little bit bullied for unclear diction,” Lahoika said. In his early twenties, as a young, insecure founder, he met a vocal coach, Maryna “Rusia” Shukiurava, who taught him that voice and communication could be trained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To help others, they started a YouTube channel that eventually morphed into Vocal Image, which positions its subscription-based app as an affordable alternative to one-on-one coaching you can use at home. “You can make strange movements, strange sounds […] and feel safe,” Lahoika said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With an interactive library that includes tongue twisters, breathing exercises, and advice on gestures, Vocal Image is also leaning more and more into AI to give automated feedback and personalized tips, thanks in big part to the addition of co-founder and CTO Mikalai Karaliou, Lahoika said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3040954" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/vocal-image-screenshot.png?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These guided journeys mostly revolve around work-related goals such as enhancing professional or leadership skills, and developing public speaking or presentation abilities. But Vocal Image also supports people who simply want to increase their self-confidence, as well as LGBTQ people, whose rights Shukiurava had been supporting in Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the trio is from Belarus, they were among the many Belarusian founders who left their home country after protests failed to oust President Alexander Lukashenko and were met with brutal repression. Lahoika picked Estonia for its business environment, which has so far proven favorable for the startup.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shortly after relocating to Tallinn, Vocal Image joined local accelerator Startup Wise Guys, which considers the startup as one of its “success stories” due to its fast growth. According to Lahoika, the startup subsequently reached $6.5 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) on less than $1 million in pre-seed funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More recently, the startup raised a $3.6 million seed round led by French edtech VC firm Educapital, with participation from Specialist VC out of Estonia and Generations Fund out of Germany, TechCrunch learned exclusively.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As of August, the startup now claims $12 million of ARR and some 50,000 paid users, Lahoika said. With a team of 20 people, including a majority of Belarusian exiles, Vocal Image now plans to grow its development team and deploy more localizations (in addition to English, Spanish, German, French, Ukrainian and Russian).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This funding comes not long after the startup was picked by Hugging Face, Meta, and Scaleway as one of the five winners of their European AI Startup Program, but also at a time when it is facing increased competition. For instance, edtech company Headway recently added an AI-powered speech trainer to its social skills app, Skillsta. But Vocal Image can count on its own GDPR-compliant AI trove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With some 35,000 recordings a day, Vocal Image has amassed more than 1 million real-voice samples. Even better, these recordings are labelled by the community through Voice Rating, a collaborative feature that lets users decide whether others sound “confident” or “childlike.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is the kind of dataset that apps like Vocal Image sorely need in order to improve their accuracy. It could also help AI startups fine-tune their artificial voices, creating further tailwinds for the startup beyond its B2C roots.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;With 4 million app downloads, Estonia-based startup Vocal Image aims to help people improve their voice and communication skills with AI-powered coaching.

And they’re paying for it with their health. A diet high in sugar, sodium, and saturated fat can increase the risk of problems like diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease, to name a few. And those are among&amp;nbsp;the leading causes of death in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is hardly news. But this week Robert F Kennedy Jr., who heads the US Department of Health and Human Services, floated a new solution to the problem. Kennedy and education secretary Linda McMahon think that teaching medical students more about the role of nutrition in health could help turn things around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I’m working with Linda on forcing medical schools … to put nutrition into medical school education,” Kennedy said during&amp;nbsp;a cabinet meeting on August 26.&lt;/strong&gt; The next day, HHS released&amp;nbsp;a statement calling for “increased nutrition education” for medical students.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We can reverse the chronic-disease epidemic simply by changing our diets and lifestyles,” Kennedy said in&amp;nbsp;an accompanying video statement. “But to do that, we need nutrition to be a basic part of every doctor’s training.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It certainly sounds like a good idea. If more Americans ate a healthier diet, we could expect to see a decrease in those diseases. &lt;strong&gt;But this framing of America’s health crisis is overly simplistic,&lt;/strong&gt; especially given that plenty of the administration’s other actions have directly undermined health in multiple ways—including by canceling a vital nutrition education program.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At any rate, there are other, more effective ways to tackle the chronic-disease crisis.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The biggest killers, heart disease and stroke,&amp;nbsp;are responsible for more than a third of deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing those conditions. And it makes total sense to educate the future doctors of America about nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical bodies are on board with the idea, too. &lt;/strong&gt;“The importance of nutrition in medical education is increasingly clear, and we support expanded, evidence-based instruction to better equip physicians to prevent and manage chronic disease and improve patient outcomes,” David H. Aizuss, chair of the American Medical Association’s board of trustees, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it’s not as though medical students aren’t getting &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; nutrition education. And that training has increased in the last five years, according to&amp;nbsp;surveys carried out by the American Association of Medical Colleges.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy has referred to&amp;nbsp;a 2021 survey suggesting that medical students in the US get only around one hour of nutrition education per year. &lt;/strong&gt;But the AAMC argues that nutrition education increasingly happens through “integrated experiences” rather than stand-alone lectures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Medical schools understand the critical role that nutrition plays in preventing, managing, and treating chronic health conditions, and incorporate significant nutrition education across their required curricula,” Alison J. Whelan, AAMC’s chief academic officer, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s not to say there isn’t room for improvement. Gabby Headrick, a food systems dietician and associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety &amp;amp; Nutrition Security, thinks nutritionists could take a more prominent role in patient care, too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it’s somewhat galling for the administration to choose medical education as its focus given the recent cuts in federal funding that will affect health.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, funding for the National Diabetes Prevention Program, which offers support and guidance to help thousands of people adopt healthy diets and exercise routines, was canceled by the Trump administration in March.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The focus on medical schools also overlooks one of the biggest factors behind poor nutrition in the US: access to healthy food. A recent&amp;nbsp;survey by the Pew Research Center found that increased costs make it harder for &lt;em&gt;most Americans&lt;/em&gt; to eat well. Twenty percent of the people surveyed acknowledged that their diets were not healthy.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“So many people know what a healthy diet is, and they know what should be on their plate every night,” says Headrick, who has researched this issue. “But the vast majority of folks just truly do not have the money or the time to get the food on the plate.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has been helping low-income Americans afford some of those healthier foods.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;nbsp;supported over 41 million people in 2024. But under the Trump administration’s tax and spending bill,&amp;nbsp;the program is set to lose around $186 billion in funding over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s focus is on education. And it just so happens that there is a nutrition education program in place—one that helps people of all ages learn not only what healthy foods are, but how to source them on a budget and use them to prepare meals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNAP-Ed, as it’s known, has already provided this support to millions of Americans. Under the Trump administration, it is&amp;nbsp;set to be eliminated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to see how these actions are going to help people adopt healthier diets. What might be a better approach? I put the question to Headrick: If she were in charge, what policies would she enact?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Universal health care,” she told me. &lt;/strong&gt;Being able to access health care without risking financial hardship not only&amp;nbsp;improves health outcomes and life expectancy; it also spares people from medical debt—something that&amp;nbsp;affects around 40% of adults in the US, according to a recent survey.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the Trump administration’s plans to&amp;nbsp;cut federal health spending by about a trillion dollars over the next decade certainly aren’t going to help with that. All told, around 16 million people could lose their health insurance by 2034, according to&amp;nbsp;estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The evidence suggests that if we cut folks’ social benefit programs, such as access to health care and food, we are going to see detrimental impacts,” says Headrick. “And it’s going to cause an increased burden of preventable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

The decision to greenlight Clean Core Thorium Energy’s license is a major step toward closer cooperation between the two countries on atomic energy and marks a milestone in the development of thorium as an alternative to uranium for fueling nuclear reactors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Starting from the issuance last week, the thorium fuel produced by the Chicago-based company can be shipped to reactors in India, where it could be loaded into the cores of existing reactors. Once Clean Core receives final approval from Indian regulators, it will become one of the first American companies to sell nuclear technology to India, just as the world’s most populous nation has started relaxing strict rules that have long kept the US private sector from entering its atomic power industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This license marks a turning point, not just for Clean Core but for the US-India civil nuclear partnership,” says Mehul Shah, the company's chief executive and founder. “It places thorium at the center of the global energy transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thorium has long been seen as a good alternative to uranium because it’s more abundant, produces both smaller amounts of long-lived radioactive waste and fewer byproducts with centuries-long half-lives, and reduces the risk that materials from the fuel cycle will be diverted into weapons manufacturing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But at least some uranium fuel is needed to make thorium atoms split, making it an imperfect replacement. It’s also less well suited for use in the light-water reactors that power the vast majority of commercial nuclear plants worldwide. And in any case, the complex, highly regulated nuclear industry is extremely resistant to change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For India, which has scant uranium reserves but abundant deposits of thorium, the latter metal has been part of a long-term strategy for reducing dependence on imported fuels. The nation started negotiating a nuclear export treaty with the US in the early 2000s, and a 123 Agreement—a special, Senate-approved treaty the US requires with another country before sending it any civilian nuclear products—was approved in 2008.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A new approach&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While most thorium advocates have envisioned new reactors designed to run on this fuel, which would mean rebuilding the nuclear industry from the ground up, Shah and his team took a different approach. Clean Core created a new type of fuel that blends thorium with a more concentrated type of uranium called HALEU (high-assay low-enriched uranium). This blended fuel can be used in India’s pressurized heavy-water reactors, which make up the bulk of the country’s existing fleet and many of the new units under development now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thorium isn’t a fissile material itself, meaning its atoms aren’t inherently unstable enough for an extra neutron to easily split the nuclei and release energy. But the metal has what’s known as “fertile properties,” meaning it can absorb neutrons and transform into the fissile material uranium-233. Uranium-233 produces fewer long-lived radioactive isotopes than the uranium-235 that makes up the fissionable part of traditional fuel pellets. Most commercial reactors run on low-enriched uranium, which is about 5% U-235. When the fuel is spent, roughly 95% of the energy potential is left in the metal. And what remains is a highly toxic cocktail of long-lived radioactive isotopes such as cesium-137 and plutonium-239, which keep the waste dangerous for tens of thousands of years. Another concern is that the plutonium could be extracted for use in weapons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Enriched up to 20%, HALEU allows reactors to extract more of the available energy and thus reduce the volume of waste. Clean Core’s fuel goes further: The HALEU provides the initial spark to ignite fertile thorium and triggers a reaction that can burn much hotter and utilize the vast majority of the material in the core, as a study published last year in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nuclear Engineering and Design&lt;/em&gt; showed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Thorium provides attributes needed to achieve higher burnups,” says Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear science and engineering who helped design Clean Core’s fuel assemblies. “It is enabling technology to go to higher burnups, which reduces your spent fuel volume, increases your fuel efficiency, and reduces the amount of uranium that you need.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared with traditional uranium fuel, Clean Core says, its fuel reduces waste by more than 85% while avoiding the most problematic isotopes produced during fission. “The result is a safer, more sustainable cycle that reframes nuclear power not as a source of millennia-long liabilities but as a pathway to cleaner energy and a viable future fuel supply,” says Milan Shah, Clean Core’s chief operating officer and Mehul’s son.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pressurized heavy-water reactors are particularly well suited to thorium because heavy water—a version of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O that has an extra neutron on the hydrogen atom—absorbs fewer neutrons during the fission process, increasing efficiency by allowing more neutrons to be captured by the thorium. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are 46 so-called PHWRs operating worldwide: 17 in Canada, 19 in India, three each in Argentina and South Korea, and two each in China and Romania, according to data from the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 1954, India set out a three-stage development plan for nuclear power that involved eventually phasing thorium into the fuel cycle for its fleet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet in the 56 years since India built its first commercial nuclear plant, its state-controlled industry has remained relatively shut off to the private sector and the rest of the world. When the US signed the 123 Agreement with India in 2008, the moment heralded an era in which the subcontinent could become a testing ground for new American reactor designs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;In 2010, however, India passed the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act. The legislation was based on what lawmakers saw as legal shortcomings in the wake of the 1984 Bhopal chemical factory disaster, when a subsidiary of the American industrial giant Dow Chemical avoided major payouts to the victims of a catastrophe that killed thousands. Under this law, responsibility for an accident at an Indian nuclear plant would fall on suppliers. The statute effectively killed any exports to India, since few companies could shoulder that burden. Only Russia’s state-owned Rosatom charged ahead with exporting reactors to India.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But things are changing. In a joint statement issued after a February 2025 summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump "announced their commitment to fully realise the US-India 123 Civil Nuclear Agreement by moving forward with plans to work together to build US-designed nuclear reactors in India through large scale localisation and possible technology transfer.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In March 2025, US federal officials gave the nuclear developer Holtec International an export license to sell Indian companies its as-yet-unbuilt small modular reactors, which are based on the light-water reactor design used in the US. In April, the Indian government suggested it would reform the nuclear liability law to relax rules on foreign companies in hopes of drawing more overseas developers. Last month, a top minister confirmed that the Modi administration would overhaul the law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“For India, the thing they need to do is get another international vendor in the marketplace,” says Chris Gadomski, the chief nuclear analyst at the consultancy BloombergNEF.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Path of least resistance&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Shah sees larger potential for Clean Core. Unlike Holtec, whose export license was endorsed by the two Mumbai-based industrial giants Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro and Tata Consulting Engineers, Clean Core had its permit approved by two of India’s atomic regulators and its main state-owned nuclear company. By focusing on fuel rather than new reactors, Clean Core could become a vendor to the majority of the existing plants already operating in India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Its technology diverges not only from that of other US nuclear companies but also from the approach used in China. Last year, China made waves by bringing its first thorium-fueled reactor online. This enabled it to establish a new foothold in a technology the US had invented and then abandoned, and it gave Beijing another leg up in atomic energy. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But scaling that technology will require building out a whole new kind of reactor. That comes at a cost. A recent Johns Hopkins University study found that China’s success in building nuclear reactors stemmed in large part from standardization and repetition of successful designs, virtually all of which have been light-water reactors. Using thorium in existing heavy-water reactors lowers the bar for popularizing the fuel, according to the younger Shah.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We think ours is the path of least resistance,” Milan Shah says. “Maybe not being completely revolutionary in the way you look at nuclear today, but incredibly evolutionary to progress humanity forward.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The company has plans to go beyond pressurized heavy-water reactors. Within two years, the elder Shah says, Clean Core plans to design a version of its fuel that could work in the light-water reactors that make up the entire US fleet of 94. But it’s not a simple conversion. For starters, there’s the size: While the PHWR fuel rods are about 50 centimeters in length, the rods that go into light-water reactors are roughly four meters long. Then there’s the history of challenges with light water’s absorption of neutrons that could otherwise be captured to induce fission in the thorium.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Anil Kakodkar, the former chairman of India’s Atomic Energy Commission and a mentor to Shah, popularizing thorium could help rectify one of the darker chapters in his country’s nuclear development. In 1974, India became the first country since the signing of the first global Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to successfully test an atomic weapon. New Delhi was never a signatory to the pact. But the milestone prompted neighboring Pakistan to develop its own weapons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In response, President Jimmy Carter tried to demonstrate Washington’s commitment to reversing the Cold War arms race by sacrificing the first US effort to commercialize nuclear waste recycling, since the technology to separate plutonium and other radioisotopes from uranium in spent fuel was widely seen as a potential new source of weapons-grade material. By running its own reactors on thorium, Kakodkar says, India can chart a new path for newcomer nations that want to harness the power of the atom without stoking fears that nuclear weapons capability will spread.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The proliferation concerns will be dismissed to a significant extent, allowing more rapid growth of nuclear power in emerging countries,” he says. “That will be a good thing for the world at large.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexander C.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This American nuclear company could help India’s thorium dream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;For just the second time in nearly two decades, the United States has granted an export license to an American company planning to sell nuclear technology to India, MIT Technology Review has learned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The decision to greenlight Clean Core Thorium Energy’s license is a major step toward closer cooperation between the two countries on atomic energy and marks a milestone in the development of thorium as an alternative to uranium for fueling nuclear reactors.

And they’re paying for it with their health. A diet high in sugar, sodium, and saturated fat can increase the risk of problems like diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease, to name a few. And those are among the leading causes of death in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is hardly news. But this week Robert F Kennedy Jr., who heads the US Department of Health and Human Services, floated a new solution to the problem: teaching medical students more about the role of nutrition in health could help turn things around.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It certainly sounds like a good idea. If more Americans ate a healthier diet, we could expect to see a decrease in those diseases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;But this framing of America’s health crisis is overly simplistic, especially given that plenty of the administration’s other actions have directly undermined health in multiple ways—including by canceling a vital nutrition education program. And at any rate, there are other, more effective ways to tackle the chronic-disease crisis.

          &lt;p&gt;Google is advising users of the Salesloft Drift AI chat agent to consider all security tokens connected to the platform compromised following the discovery that unknown attackers used some of the credentials to access email from Google Workspace accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Google has revoked the tokens that were used in the breaches and disabled integration between the Salesloft Drift agent and all Workspace accounts as it investigates further. The company has also notified all affected account holders of the compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scope expanded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery, reported Thursday in an advisory update, indicates that a Salesloft Drift breach it reported on Tuesday is broader than previously known. Prior to the update, members of the Google Threat Intelligence Group said the compromised tokens were limited to Salesloft Drift integrations with Salesforce. The compromise of the Workspace accounts prompted Google to change that assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on new information identified by GTIG, the scope of this compromise is not exclusive to the Salesforce integration with Salesloft Drift and impacts other integrations,” Thursday’s update stated. “We now advise all Salesloft Drift customers to treat any and all authentication tokens stored in or connected to the Drift platform as potentially compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Salesloft’s security guidance page made no reference to the new information and instead continued to indicate that the breach affected only Drift integrations with Salesforce. Company representatives didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking confirmation of the Google finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salesloft Drift is an AI-powered chat agent that allows websites to provide real-time, human-like interactions with potential customers. Salesloft acquired the Drift platform 18 months ago. To streamline the sales process, Drift can integrate into a variety of other services, including with Salesforce (no relation to Salesloft) and other customer relationship management platforms, Slack, Google Workspace, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google on Tuesday said that an attack group it tracks as UNC6395 had engaged in a mass data-theft campaign that used compromised Drift OAuth tokens to gain access to Salesforce instances. Once inside, the attackers accessed sensitive data stored in the Salesforce accounts and searched them for credentials that could be used to access accounts on services such as AWS and Snowflake. The theft spree began no later than August 8 and lasted through at least August 18. In response to the discovery, Salesforce disabled Drift integrations with its main cloud service as well as its Slack and Pardot platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s Thursday update means that the incident likely hasn’t been fully contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We recommend organizations take immediate action to review all third-party integrations connected to their Drift instance, revoke and rotate credentials for those applications, and investigate all connected systems for signs of unauthorized access,” the update stated. It went on to say that Salesloft has now retained the Google-owned Mandiant incident response service to investigate the breach.&lt;/p&gt;

This divide could easily unravel the personalised shopping experience that brands are working so hard to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rush to bring AI into marketing has been fast and decisive. As Sara Richter, CMO at SAP Emarsys, puts it, “AI marketing is now fully in motion: it has transitioned from the theoretical to the practical as marketers welcome AI into their strategies and test possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For businesses, the appeal is obvious. 71 percent of marketers say AI helps them launch campaigns faster, saving them over two hours on average for each one. This newfound efficiency is doing what we often hear AI is best at: freeing up teams from repetitive work. 72 percent report they can now focus on more creative and strategic tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are hitting the bottom line, too. 60 percent of marketers have seen customer engagement climb, and 58 percent report a boost in customer loyalty since bringing AI on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shoppers are telling a different story. The report reveals a “personalisation gap,” where the efforts of marketers just aren’t hitting the mark. Even with heavy investment in AI-driven tailoring, 40 percent of consumers feel that brands just don’t get them as people—a huge jump from 25 percent last year. To make matters worse, 60 percent say the marketing emails they receive are mostly irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dig deeper, and you find a real crisis of confidence in how personal data is being handled for AI marketing. 63 percent of consumers globally don’t trust AI with their data, up from 44 percent in 2024. In the UK, it’s even more stark, with 76 percent of shoppers feeling uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collapse in trust is happening just as new rules come into play. A year after the EU’s AI Act was introduced, more than a third (37%) of UK marketers have overhauled their approach to AI, with 44% stating their use of the technology has become more ethical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a tension that the whole industry is talking about: how to be responsible without killing innovation. While the AI Act provides a clearer rulebook, over a quarter (28%) of marketing professionals are worried that rigid regulations could stifle creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr Stefan Wenzell, Chief Product Officer at SAP Emarsys, says, “regulation must strike a balance – protecting consumers without slowing innovation. At SAP Emarsys, we believe responsible AI is about building trust through clarity, relevance, and smart data use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message for retailers is loud and clear: prove your worth. People are happy to use AI when it actually helps them. Over half of shoppers agree that AI makes shopping easier (55%) and faster (53%), using it to find products, compare prices, or come up with gift ideas. The interest in helpful AI is there, but it has to come with a promise of transparency and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some brands are getting this right by focusing on people, not just the technology. Sterling Doak, Head of Marketing at iconic guitar maker Gibson, says it’s about thinking differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I can find a utility [AI] that can help my staff think more strategically and creatively, that’s needed because we’re a very creative business at the core,” Doak explains. For Gibson, AI serves human creativity rather than just automating tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a similar story for Australian retailer City Beach, which used AI marketing to keep its customers coming back. Mike Cheng, the company’s Head of Digital, discovered AI was the ideal tool for spotting and winning back customers who were about to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI was able to predict where people were churning or defecting at a 1:1 level, and this allowed us to send campaigns based on customers’ individual lifecycle,” Cheng notes. Their approach brought back 48 percent of those customers within three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these success stories have in common is a focus on solving real problems for people. As retailers venture deeper into what SAP Emarsys calls the “Engagement Era,” the way forward is becoming clearer. Investment in AI isn’t slowing down—64 percent of marketers are planning to increase their spend next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology isn’t the problem; it’s how it’s being used. Retailers need to close the gap between what they’re doing and what their customers are feeling. That means going beyond basic personalisation to offer real value, being open about how data is used, and proving that sharing information leads to a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI revolution is here, but for it to truly succeed, marketing professionals need to remember the person on the other side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Vids gets AI avatars and image-to-video tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for the AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo event series." class="wp-image-109137" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This divide could easily unravel the personalised shopping experience that brands are working so hard to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rush to bring AI into marketing has been fast and decisive. As Sara Richter, CMO at SAP Emarsys, puts it, “AI marketing is now fully in motion: it has transitioned from the theoretical to the practical as marketers welcome AI into their strategies and test possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For businesses, the appeal is obvious. 71 percent of marketers say AI helps them launch campaigns faster, saving them over two hours on average for each one. This newfound efficiency is doing what we often hear AI is best at: freeing up teams from repetitive work. 72 percent report they can now focus on more creative and strategic tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are hitting the bottom line, too. 60 percent of marketers have seen customer engagement climb, and 58 percent report a boost in customer loyalty since bringing AI on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shoppers are telling a different story. The report reveals a “personalisation gap,” where the efforts of marketers just aren’t hitting the mark. Even with heavy investment in AI-driven tailoring, 40 percent of consumers feel that brands just don’t get them as people—a huge jump from 25 percent last year. To make matters worse, 60 percent say the marketing emails they receive are mostly irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dig deeper, and you find a real crisis of confidence in how personal data is being handled for AI marketing. 63 percent of consumers globally don’t trust AI with their data, up from 44 percent in 2024. In the UK, it’s even more stark, with 76 percent of shoppers feeling uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collapse in trust is happening just as new rules come into play. A year after the EU’s AI Act was introduced, more than a third (37%) of UK marketers have overhauled their approach to AI, with 44% stating their use of the technology has become more ethical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a tension that the whole industry is talking about: how to be responsible without killing innovation. While the AI Act provides a clearer rulebook, over a quarter (28%) of marketing professionals are worried that rigid regulations could stifle creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr Stefan Wenzell, Chief Product Officer at SAP Emarsys, says, “regulation must strike a balance – protecting consumers without slowing innovation. At SAP Emarsys, we believe responsible AI is about building trust through clarity, relevance, and smart data use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message for retailers is loud and clear: prove your worth. People are happy to use AI when it actually helps them. Over half of shoppers agree that AI makes shopping easier (55%) and faster (53%), using it to find products, compare prices, or come up with gift ideas. The interest in helpful AI is there, but it has to come with a promise of transparency and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some brands are getting this right by focusing on people, not just the technology. Sterling Doak, Head of Marketing at iconic guitar maker Gibson, says it’s about thinking differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I can find a utility [AI] that can help my staff think more strategically and creatively, that’s needed because we’re a very creative business at the core,” Doak explains. For Gibson, AI serves human creativity rather than just automating tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a similar story for Australian retailer City Beach, which used AI marketing to keep its customers coming back. Mike Cheng, the company’s Head of Digital, discovered AI was the ideal tool for spotting and winning back customers who were about to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI was able to predict where people were churning or defecting at a 1:1 level, and this allowed us to send campaigns based on customers’ individual lifecycle,” Cheng notes. Their approach brought back 48 percent of those customers within three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these success stories have in common is a focus on solving real problems for people. As retailers venture deeper into what SAP Emarsys calls the “Engagement Era,” the way forward is becoming clearer. Investment in AI isn’t slowing down—64 percent of marketers are planning to increase their spend next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology isn’t the problem; it’s how it’s being used. Retailers need to close the gap between what they’re doing and what their customers are feeling. That means going beyond basic personalisation to offer real value, being open about how data is used, and proving that sharing information leads to a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI revolution is here, but for it to truly succeed, marketing professionals need to remember the person on the other side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Vids gets AI avatars and image-to-video tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for the AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo event series." class="wp-image-109137" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
