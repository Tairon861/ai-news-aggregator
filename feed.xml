And when it comes to artificial intelligence, the conversations aren’t just technical — they’re creative, cinematic, and boundary-pushing. That’s why Nikola Todorovic is headed to the AI Stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A visual effects veteran turned AI entrepreneur, Todorovic is the co-founder of Wonder Dynamics, now an Autodesk company. Alongside actor and producer Tye Sheridan, he helped launch Autodesk Flow Studio (formerly Wonder Studio), a groundbreaking AI platform that allows creators to seamlessly integrate 3D characters into live-action scenes. The platform uses cloud-based tools to automate complex processes like lighting, animation, and composition, giving filmmakers a radically faster and more accessible path to high-end visual effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-film-meets-ai"&gt;Where film meets AI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Todorovic’s journey to this moment wasn’t traditional, but that’s exactly the point. As an award-winning filmmaker and VFX supervisor, he spent years working at the intersection of storytelling and technology. That experience led to Wonder Dynamics, where the mission has always been to empower artists, not replace them. The company’s acquisition by Autodesk in 2024 marked a major validation of that vision, and now Todorovic is helping shape the future of creative AI inside one of the industry’s biggest ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At Disrupt, he’ll join &lt;strong&gt;other AI industry leaders&lt;/strong&gt; for a wide-ranging panel on what’s coming next — from generative tools to ethical design to the future of creator workflows. Stay tuned to the fast-growing &lt;strong&gt;Disrupt agenda page&lt;/strong&gt; for the latest updates. Expect a conversation in Todorovic’s session that spans beyond buzzwords and dives into the real-world impact of AI in media and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Join 10,000 other tech and VC leaders on the AI Stage at &lt;strong&gt;TechCrunch Disrupt 2025&lt;/strong&gt; to hear from Nikola Todorovic and other top voices driving the future of artificial intelligence.

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese AI lab Sakana AI has introduced a new technique that allows multiple large language models (LLMs) to cooperate on a single task, effectively creating a “dream team” of AI agents. The method, called Multi-LLM AB-MCTS, enables models to perform trial-and-error and combine their unique strengths to solve problems that are too complex for any individual model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, this approach provides a means to develop more robust and capable AI systems. Instead of being locked into a single provider or model, businesses could dynamically leverage the best aspects of different frontier models, assigning the right AI for the right part of a task to achieve superior results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-power-of-collective-intelligence"&gt;The power of collective intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Frontier AI models are evolving rapidly. However, each model has its own distinct strengths and weaknesses derived from its unique training data and architecture. One might excel at coding, while another excels at creative writing. Sakana AI’s researchers argue that these differences are not a bug, but a feature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We see these biases and varied aptitudes not as limitations, but as precious resources for creating collective intelligence,” the researchers state in their blog post. They believe that just as humanity’s greatest achievements come from diverse teams, AI systems can also achieve more by working together. “By pooling their intelligence, AI systems can solve problems that are insurmountable for any single model.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thinking-longer-at-inference-time"&gt;Thinking longer at inference time&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sakana AI’s new algorithm is an “inference-time scaling” technique (also referred to as “test-time scaling”), an area of research that has become very popular in the past year. While most of the focus in AI has been on “training-time scaling” (making models bigger and training them on larger datasets), inference-time scaling improves performance by allocating more computational resources after a model is already trained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One common approach involves using reinforcement learning to prompt models to generate longer, more detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences, as seen in popular models such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek-R1. Another, simpler method is repeated sampling, where the model is given the same prompt multiple times to generate a variety of potential solutions, similar to a brainstorming session. Sakana AI’s work combines and advances these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our framework offers a smarter, more strategic version of Best-of-N (aka repeated sampling),” Takuya Akiba, research scientist at Sakana AI and co-author of the paper, told VentureBeat. “It complements reasoning techniques like long CoT through RL. By dynamically selecting the search strategy and the appropriate LLM, this approach maximizes performance within a limited number of LLM calls, delivering better results on complex tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-adaptive-branching-search-works"&gt;How adaptive branching search works&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The core of the new method is an algorithm called Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS). It enables an LLM to effectively perform trial-and-error by intelligently balancing two different search strategies: “searching deeper” and “searching wider.” Searching deeper involves taking a promising answer and repeatedly refining it, while searching wider means generating completely new solutions from scratch. AB-MCTS combines these approaches, allowing the system to improve a good idea but also to pivot and try something new if it hits a dead end or discovers another promising direction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, the system uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a decision-making algorithm famously used by DeepMind’s AlphaGo. At each step, AB-MCTS uses probability models to decide whether it’s more strategic to refine an existing solution or generate a new one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3013775" height="422" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image_ac751e.png?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different test-time scaling strategies Source: Sakana AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers took this a step further with Multi-LLM AB-MCTS, which not only decides “what” to do (refine vs. generate) but also “which” LLM should do it. At the start of a task, the system doesn’t know which model is best suited for the problem. It begins by trying a balanced mix of available LLMs and, as it progresses, learns which models are more effective, allocating more of the workload to them over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-putting-the-ai-dream-team-to-the-test"&gt;Putting the AI ‘dream team’ to the test&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their Multi-LLM AB-MCTS system on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark. ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) is designed to test a human-like ability to solve novel visual reasoning problems, making it notoriously difficult for AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used a combination of frontier models, including o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The collective of models was able to find correct solutions for over 30% of the 120 test problems, a score that significantly outperformed any of the models working alone. The system demonstrated the ability to dynamically assign the best model for a given problem. On tasks where a clear path to a solution existed, the algorithm quickly identified the most effective LLM and used it more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="AB-MCTS vs individual models (source: Sakana AI)" class="wp-image-3013776" height="414" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image_fae32e.png?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AB-MCTS vs individual models Source: Sakana AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More impressively, the team observed instances where the models solved problems that were previously impossible for any single one of them. In one case, a solution generated by the o4-mini model was incorrect. However, the system passed this flawed attempt to DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini-2.5 Pro, which were able to analyze the error, correct it, and ultimately produce the right answer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This demonstrates that Multi-LLM AB-MCTS can flexibly combine frontier models to solve previously unsolvable problems, pushing the limits of what is achievable by using LLMs as a collective intelligence,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="AB-MTCS can select different models at different stages of solving a problem (source: Sakana AI)" class="wp-image-3013777" height="170" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image_579cf6.png?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AB-MTCS can select different models at different stages of solving a problem Source: Sakana AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In addition to the individual pros and cons of each model, the tendency to hallucinate can vary significantly among them,” Akiba said. “By creating an ensemble with a model that is less likely to hallucinate, it could be possible to achieve the best of both worlds: powerful logical capabilities and strong groundedness. Since hallucination is a major issue in a business context, this approach could be valuable for its mitigation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-research-to-real-world-applications"&gt;From research to real-world applications&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help developers and businesses apply this technique, Sakana AI has released the underlying algorithm as an open-source framework called TreeQuest, available under an Apache 2.0 license (usable for commercial purposes). TreeQuest provides a flexible API, allowing users to implement Multi-LLM AB-MCTS for their own tasks with custom scoring and logic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While we are in the early stages of applying AB-MCTS to specific business-oriented problems, our research reveals significant potential in several areas,” Akiba said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, the team was able to successfully apply AB-MCTS to tasks like complex algorithmic coding and improving the accuracy of machine learning models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AB-MCTS could also be highly effective for problems that require iterative trial-and-error, such as optimizing performance metrics of existing software,” Akiba said. “For example, it could be used to automatically find ways to improve the response latency of a web service.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The release of a practical, open-source tool could pave the way for a new class of more powerful and reliable enterprise AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;

But rivals are coming. (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/cluelys-arr-doubled-in-a-week-to-7m-founder-roy-lee-says-but-rivals-are-coming/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG-0036-from-100CANON.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cluely’s revenue has skyrocketed to about $7 million in ARR since it launched its new enterprise product a week ago, founder Roy Lee told TechCrunch. “Every single person who has a meeting or an interview is testing this out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cluely, one of Silicon Valley’s most-talked-about startups, offers products that use AI to analyze online conversations, deliver real-time notes, provide context, and suggest questions to ask. This information appeared discreetly on the user’s screen, invisible to others.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For weeks leading up to the product reveal, Lee boasted that the company’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) exceeded $3 million and that the startup was profitable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The increase in interest is coming from consumers and businesses alike, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cluely is a startup born of controversy after Lee posted in a viral X thread saying he was suspended by Columbia University because he and a co-founder developed a tool to cheat on job interviews for software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He turned around and created a product and startup out of the tech, originally using the marketing tagline that it helps you “cheat on everything.” Now that it is backed by big-league VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, Abstract Ventures, and Susa Ventures, it has toned down its marketing to “Everything You Need. Before You Ask. … This feels like cheating.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It has turned into a Silicon Valley sensation from its rage-bait marketing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the startup’s controversial history hasn’t stopped businesses from showing interest in Cluely’s product, Lee insists, telling us that it has signed a public company that just this week doubled its annual contract with Cluely to $2.5 million. Lee declined to name the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The enterprise version of the product is similar to the consumer offering, but it comes with some extra features such as team management and additional security settings, Lee said. Business use cases include sales calls, customer support, and remote tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Which Cluely features are the most interesting to customers? According to Lee, it’s Cluely’s ability to take real-time notes.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Meeting notes have been a proven very sticky, very interesting AI use case. The only problem with them is they’re all post-call,” Lee said of competitors’ products. “You want to look back at them in the middle of a meeting, and that is what we offer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Cluely’s real-time notetaker may be easy to replicate. On Thursday, Pickle, a company that describes itself as a digital clone factory, claimed on X that it built Glass, an open source, free product with very similar functionality to Cluely. By mid-day it had already garnered over 850 stars and been forked nearly 150 times — indicating that the open source developer community is giving this free version a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Time will tell if Cluely’s meteoric rise can withstand competition from free copycat products like Glass.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG-0036-from-100CANON.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cluely’s revenue has skyrocketed to about $7 million in ARR since it launched its new enterprise product a week ago, founder Roy Lee told TechCrunch. “Every single person who has a meeting or an interview is testing this out.”&lt;/p&gt;
