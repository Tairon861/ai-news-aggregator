It will build on an effort to improve the collection of emissions data that former president Joe Biden launched in 2023—and which President Trump nullified on his first day in office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The initiative will help prioritize responses to changes in federal greenhouse-gas monitoring and measurement programs, but the Data Foundation stresses that it will primarily serve a “long-standing need for coordination” of such efforts outside of government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new greenhouse-gas coalition is one of a growing number of nonprofit and academic groups that have spun up or shifted focus to keep essential climate monitoring and research efforts going amid the Trump administration’s assault on environmental funding, staffing, and regulations. Those include efforts to ensure that US scientists can continue to contribute to the UN’s major climate report and publish assessments of the rising domestic risks of climate change. Otherwise, the loss of these programs will make it increasingly difficult for communities to understand how more frequent or severe wildfires, droughts, heat waves, and floods will harm them—and how dire the dangers could become.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Few believe that nonprofits or private industry can come close to filling the funding holes that the Trump administration is digging. But observers say it’s essential to try to sustain efforts to understand the risks of climate change that the federal government has historically overseen, even if the attempts are merely stopgap measures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we give up these sources of emissions data, “we’re flying blind,” says Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “We’re deliberating taking away the very information that would help us understand the problem and how to address it best.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Improving emissions estimates&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the US Forest Service, and other agencies have long collected information about greenhouse gases in a variety of ways. These include self-reporting by industry; shipboard, balloon, and aircraft readings of gas concentrations in the atmosphere; satellite measurements of the carbon dioxide and methane released by wildfires; and on-the-ground measurements of trees. The EPA, in turn, collects and publishes the data from these disparate sources as the Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that report comes out on a two-year lag, and studies show that some of the estimates it relies on could be way off—particularly the self-reported ones.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A recent analysis using satellites to measure methane pollution from four large landfills found they produce, on average, six times more emissions than the facilities had reported to the EPA. Likewise, a 2018 study in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; found that the actual methane leaks from oil and gas infrastructure were about 60% higher than the self-reported estimates in the agency’s inventory.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s initiative—the National Strategy to Advance an Integrated US Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System—aimed to adopt state-of-the-art tools and methods to improve the accuracy of these estimates, including satellites and other monitoring technologies that can replace or check self-reported information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The administration specifically sought to achieve these improvements through partnerships between government, industry, and nonprofits. The initiative called for the data collected across groups to be published to an online portal in formats that would be accessible to policymakers and the public.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moving toward a system that produces more current and reliable data is essential for understanding the rising risks of climate change and tracking whether industries are abiding by government regulations and voluntary climate commitments, says Ben Poulter, a former NASA scientist who coordinated the Biden administration effort as a deputy director in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Once you have this operational system, you can provide near-real-time information that can help drive climate action,” Poulter says. He is now a senior scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, a nonprofit focused on accelerating emerging methods of combating climate change, and he is advising the Data Foundation’s Climate Data Collaborative, which is overseeing the new greenhouse-gas initiative.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Slashed staffing and funding&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the momentum behind the federal strategy deflated when Trump returned to office. On his first day, he signed an executive order that effectively halted it. The White House has since slashed staffing across the agencies at the heart of the effort, sought to shut down specific programs that generate emissions data, and raised uncertainties about the fate of numerous other program components.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;In April, the administration missed a deadline to share the updated greenhouse-gas inventory with the United Nations, for the first time in three decades, as &lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt; reported. It eventually did release the report in May, but only after the Environmental Defense Fund filed a Freedom of Information Act request.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are also indications that the collection of emissions data might be in jeopardy. In March, the EPA said it would “reconsider” the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires thousands of power plants, refineries, and other industrial facilities to report emissions each year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, the tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law earlier this month rescinds provisions in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that provided incentives or funding for corporate greenhouse-gas reporting and methane monitoring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the White House has also proposed slashing funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and shuttering a number of its labs. Those include the facility that supports the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, the world’s longest-running carbon dioxide measuring program, as well as the Global Monitoring Laboratory, which operates a global network of collection flasks that capture air samples used to measure concentrations of nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and other greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the latest appropriations negotiations, Congress seems set to spare NOAA and other agencies the full cuts pushed by the Trump administration, but that may or may not protect various climate programs within them. As observers have noted, the loss of experts throughout the federal government, coupled with the priorities set by Trump-appointed leaders of those agencies, could still prevent crucial emissions data from being collected, analyzed, and published.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“That’s a huge concern,” says David Hayes, a professor at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, who previously worked on the effort to upgrade the nation’s emissions measurement and monitoring as special assistant to President Biden for climate policy. It’s not clear “whether they’re going to continue and whether the data availability will drop off.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘A natural disaster’&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amid all these cutbacks and uncertainties, those still hoping to make progress toward an improved system for measuring greenhouse gases have had to adjust their expectations: It’s now at least as important to simply preserve or replace existing federal programs as it is to move toward more modern tools and methods.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Ryan Alexander, executive director of the Data Foundation’s Climate Data Collaborative, is optimistic that there will be opportunities to do both.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;She says the new greenhouse-gas coalition will strive to identify the highest-priority needs and help other nonprofits or companies accelerate the development of new tools or methods. It will also aim to ensure that these organizations avoid replicating one another’s efforts and deliver data with high scientific standards, in open and interoperable formats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Data Foundation declines to say what other nonprofits will be members of the coalition or how much money it hopes to raise, but it plans to make a formal announcement in the coming weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Nonprofits and companies are already playing a larger role in monitoring emissions, including organizations like Carbon Mapper, which operates satellites and aircraft that detect and measure methane emissions from particular facilities. The EDF also launched a satellite last year, known as MethaneSAT, that could spot large and small sources of emissions—though it lost power earlier this month and probably cannot be recovered.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alexander notes that shifting from self-reported figures to observational technology like satellites could not just replace but perhaps also improve on the EPA reporting program that the Trump administration has moved to shut down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the “dramatic changes” brought about by this administration, “the future will not be the past,” she says. “This is like a natural disaster. We can’t think about rebuilding in the way that things have been in the past. We have to look ahead and say, ‘What is needed? What can people afford?’”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Organizations can also use this moment to test and develop emerging technologies that could improve greenhouse-gas measurements, including novel sensors or artificial intelligence tools, Hayes says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We are at a time when we have these new tools, new technologies for measurement, measuring, and monitoring,” he says. “To some extent it’s a new era anyway, so it’s a great time to do some pilot testing here and to demonstrate how we can create new data sets in the climate area.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Saving scientific contributions&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not just the collection of emissions data that nonprofits and academic groups are hoping to save. Notably, the American Geophysical Union and its partners have taken on two additional climate responsibilities that traditionally fell to the federal government.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The US State Department’s Office of Global Change historically coordinated the nation’s contributions to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s major reports on climate risks, soliciting and nominating US scientists to help write, oversee, or edit sections of the assessments. The US Global Change Research Program, an interagency group that ran much of the process, also covered the cost of trips to a series of in-person meetings with international collaborators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the US government seems to have relinquished any involvement as the IPCC kicks off the process for the Seventh Assessment Report. In late February, the administration blocked federal scientists including NASA’s Katherine Calvin, who was previously selected as a cochair for one of the working groups, from attending an early planning meeting in China. (Calvin was the agency’s chief scientist at the time but was no longer serving in that role as of April, according to NASA’s website.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The agency didn’t respond to inquiries from interested scientists after the UN panel issued a call for nominations in March, and it failed to present a list of nominations by the deadline in April, scientists involved in the process say. The Trump administration also canceled funding for the Global Change Research Program and, earlier this month, fired the last remaining staffers working at the Office of Global Change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In response, 10 universities came together in March to form the US Academic Alliance for the IPCC, in partnership with the AGU, to request and evalute applications from US researchers. The universities—which include Yale, Princeton, and the University of California, San Diego—together nominated nearly 300 scientists, some of whom the IPCC has since officially selected. The AGU is now conducting a fundraising campaign to help pay for travel expenses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pamela McElwee, a professor at Rutgers who helped establish the academic coalition, says it’s crucial for US scientists to continue participating in the IPCC process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It is our flagship global assessment report on the state of climate, and it plays a really important role in influencing country policies,” she says. “To not be part of it makes it much more difficult for US scientists to be at the cutting edge and advance the things we need to do.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AGU also stepped in two months later, after the White House dismissed hundreds of researchers working on the National Climate Assessment, an annual report analyzing the rising dangers of climate change across the country. The AGU and American Meteorological Society together announced plans to publish a “special collection” to sustain the momentum of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s incumbent on us to ensure our communities, our neighbors, our children are all protected and prepared for the mounting risks of climate change,” said Brandon Jones, president of the AGU, in an earlier statement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AGU declined to discuss the status of the project.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Stopgap solution&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The sheer number of programs the White House is going after will require organizations to make hard choices about what they attempt to save and how they go about it. Moreover, relying entirely on nonprofits and companies to take over these federal tasks is not viable over the long term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the costs of these federal programs, it could prove prohibitive to even keep a minimum viable version of some essential monitoring systems and research programs up and running. Dispersing across various organizations the responsibility of calculating the nation’s emissions sources and sinks also creates concerns about the scientific standards applied and the accessibility of that data, Cleetus says. Plus, moving away from the records that NOAA, NASA, and other agencies have collected for decades would break the continuity of that data, undermining the ability to detect or project trends.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More basically, publishing national emissions data should be a federal responsibility, particularly for the government of the world’s second-largest climate polluter, Cleetus adds. Failing to calculate and share its contributions to climate change sidesteps the nation’s global responsibilities and sends a terrible signal to other countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Poulter stresses that nonprofits and the private sector can do only so much, for so long, to keep these systems up and running.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to give the impression that this greenhouse-gas coalition, if it gets off the ground, is a long-term solution,” he says. “But we can’t afford to have gaps in these data sets, so somebody needs to step in and help sustain those measurements.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250724-greenhouse-gases-nonprofit.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nonprofits are striving to preserve a US effort to modernize greenhouse-gas measurements, amid growing fears that the Trump administration’s dismantling of federal programs will obscure the nation’s contributions to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Data Foundation, a Washington, DC, nonprofit that advocates for open data, is fundraising for an initiative that will coordinate efforts among nonprofits, technical experts, and companies to improve the accuracy and accessibility of climate emissions information.

The Trump administration also canceled funding for the Global Change Research Program and, earlier this month, fired the last remaining staffers working at the Office of Global Change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In response, 10 universities came together in March to form the US Academic Alliance for the IPCC, in partnership with the AGU, to request and evalute applications from US researchers. The universities—which include Yale, Princeton, and the University of California, San Diego—together nominated nearly 300 scientists, some of whom the IPCC has since officially selected. The AGU is now conducting a fundraising campaign to help pay for travel expenses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pamela McElwee, a professor at Rutgers who helped establish the academic coalition, says it’s crucial for US scientists to continue participating in the IPCC process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It is our flagship global assessment report on the state of climate, and it plays a really important role in influencing country policies,” she says. “To not be part of it makes it much more difficult for US scientists to be at the cutting edge and advance the things we need to do.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AGU also stepped in two months later, after the White House dismissed hundreds of researchers working on the National Climate Assessment, an annual report analyzing the rising dangers of climate change across the country. The AGU and American Meteorological Society together announced plans to publish a “special collection” to sustain the momentum of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s incumbent on us to ensure our communities, our neighbors, our children are all protected and prepared for the mounting risks of climate change,” said Brandon Jones, president of the AGU, in an earlier statement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AGU declined to discuss the status of the project.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Stopgap solution&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The sheer number of programs the White House is going after will require organizations to make hard choices about what they attempt to save and how they go about it. Moreover, relying entirely on nonprofits and companies to take over these federal tasks is not viable over the long term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the costs of these federal programs, it could prove prohibitive to even keep a minimum viable version of some essential monitoring systems and research programs up and running. Dispersing across various organizations the responsibility of calculating the nation’s emissions sources and sinks also creates concerns about the scientific standards applied and the accessibility of that data, Cleetus says. Plus, moving away from the records that NOAA, NASA, and other agencies have collected for decades would break the continuity of that data, undermining the ability to detect or project trends.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More basically, publishing national emissions data should be a federal responsibility, particularly for the government of the world’s second-largest climate polluter, Cleetus adds. Failing to calculate and share its contributions to climate change sidesteps the nation’s global responsibilities and sends a terrible signal to other countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Poulter stresses that nonprofits and the private sector can do only so much, for so long, to keep these systems up and running.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to give the impression that this greenhouse-gas coalition, if it gets off the ground, is a long-term solution,” he says. “But we can’t afford to have gaps in these data sets, so somebody needs to step in and help sustain those measurements.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/25/1120636/how-nonprofits-and-academia-are-stepping-up-to-salvage-us-climate-programs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] The deadly saga of the controversial gene therapy Elevidys (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/25/1120621/deadly-saga-controversial-gene-therapy-elevidys/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sarepta.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has been a grim few months for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) community. There had been some excitement when, a couple of years ago, a gene therapy for the disorder was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the first time. That drug, Elevidys, has now been implicated in the deaths of two teenage boys.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The drug’s approval was always controversial—there was a lack of evidence that it actually worked, for starters. But the agency that once rubber-stamped the drug has now turned on its manufacturer, Sarepta Therapeutics. In a remarkable chain of events, the FDA asked the company to stop shipping the drug on July 18. Sarepta refused to comply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the days since, the company has acquiesced. But its reputation has already been hit. And the events have dealt a devastating blow to people desperate for treatments that might help them, their children, or other family members with DMD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DMD is a rare genetic disorder that causes muscles to degenerate over time.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s caused by a mutation in a gene that codes for a protein called dystrophin. That protein is essential for muscles—without it, muscles weaken and waste away. The disease mostly affects boys, and symptoms usually start in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;At first, affected children usually start to find it hard to jump or climb stairs. But as the disease progresses, other movements become difficult too. Eventually, the condition might affect the heart and lungs. The life expectancy of a person with DMD has recently improved, but it is still only around 30 or 40 years. There is no cure. It’s a devastating diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elevidys was designed to replace missing dystrophin with a shortened, engineered version of the protein. In June 2023,&amp;nbsp;the FDA approved the therapy for eligible four- and five-year-olds. It came with a $3.2 million price tag.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The approval was celebrated by people affected by DMD, says Debra Miller, founder of CureDuchenne, an organization that funds research into the condition and offers support to those affected by it. "We've not had much in the way of meaningful therapies," she says. "The excitement was great."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the approval was controversial.&lt;/strong&gt; It came under an “accelerated approval” program that essentially lowers the bar of evidence for drugs designed to treat “serious or life-threatening diseases where there is an unmet medical need.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elevidys was approved because it appeared to increase levels of the engineered protein in patients’ muscles. But it had not been shown to improve patient outcomes: It had failed a randomized clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The FDA approval was granted on the condition that Sarepta complete another clinical trial. The&amp;nbsp;topline results of that trial were described in October 2023 and&amp;nbsp;were published in detail a year later. Again, the drug failed to meet its “primary endpoint”—in other words, it didn’t work as well as hoped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In June 2024, the FDA &lt;em&gt;expanded&lt;/em&gt; the approval of Elevidys.&lt;/strong&gt; It granted traditional approval for the drug to treat people with DMD who are over the age of four and can walk independently, and another accelerated approval for those who can’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some experts were appalled at the FDA’s decision—even some within the FDA disagreed with it. But things weren’t so simple for people living with DMD. I spoke to some parents of such children&amp;nbsp;a couple of years ago. They pointed out that drug approvals can help bring interest and investment to DMD research. And, above all, they were desperate for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; drug that might help their children. They were desperate for hope.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately, the treatment does not appear to be delivering on that hope.&lt;/strong&gt; There have always been questions over whether it works. But now there are serious questions over how safe it is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In March 2025, a 16-year-old boy died after being treated with Elevidys. He had developed acute liver failure (ALF) after having the treatment, Sarepta&amp;nbsp;said in a statement. On June 15, the company&amp;nbsp;announced a second death—a 15-year-old who also developed ALF following Elevidys treatment. The company said it would pause shipments of the drug,&amp;nbsp;but only for patients who are not able to walk.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The following day, Sarepta held&amp;nbsp;an online presentation in which CEO Doug Ingram said that the company was exploring ways to make the treatment safer, perhaps by treating recipients with another drug that dampens their immune systems. But that same day, the company announced that&amp;nbsp;it was laying off 500 employees—36% of its workforce. Sarepta did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On June 24, the FDA&amp;nbsp;announced that it was investigating the risks of serious outcomes&lt;/strong&gt; “including hospitalization and death” associated with Elevidys, and “evaluating the need for further regulatory action.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was more tragic news on July 18, when there were&amp;nbsp;reports that a third patient had died following a Sarepta treatment. This patient, a 51-year-old, hadn’t been taking Elevidys but was enrolled in a clinical trial for a different Sarepta gene therapy designed to treat limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The same day,&amp;nbsp;the FDA asked Sarepta to voluntarily pause &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; shipments of Elevidys. Sarepta&amp;nbsp;refused to do so.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The refusal was surprising,&lt;/strong&gt; says Michael Kelly, chief scientific officer at CureDuchenne: “It was an unusual step to take.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After&amp;nbsp;significant&amp;nbsp;media&amp;nbsp;coverage, including reporting that&amp;nbsp;the FDA was “deeply troubled” by the decision and would use its “full regulatory authority,” Sarepta backed down a few days later. On July 21, the company announced its decision to&amp;nbsp;“voluntarily and temporarily” pause all shipments of Elevidys in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sarepta says it will now work with the FDA to address safety and labeling concerns. But in the meantime, the saga has left the DMD community grappling with “a mix of disappointment and concern,” says Kelly. Many are worried about the risks of taking the treatment. Others are devastated that they are no longer able to access it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Miller says she knows of families who have been working with their insurance providers to get authorization for the drug. "It's like the rug has been pulled out from under them," she says. Many families have no other treatment options. "And we know what happens when you do nothing with Duchenne," she says. Others, particularly those with teenage children with DMD, are deciding against trying the drug, she adds. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The decision over whether to take Elevidys was already a personal one based on several factors, he says. &lt;/strong&gt;People with DMD and their families deserve clear and transparent information about the treatment in order to make that decision.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The FDA's decision to approve Elevidys was made on limited data, says Kelly. But as things stand today, over 900 people have been treated with Elevidys. "That gives the FDA... an opportunity to look at real data and make informed decisions," he says. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Families facing Duchenne do not have time to waste,” Kelly says. “They must navigate a landscape where hope is tempered by the realities of medical complexity.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

Makers of these so-called “vibe-coding” tools are a hot commodity at the moment, with startups like Lovable and Cursor fending off buyers and investors keen to tap a hot trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s now become the latest to hop on this bandwagon: the company is testing a vibe-coding tool called Opal, available to users in the U.S. through Google Labs, which the company uses as a base to experiment with new tech.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opal lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, or you can remix existing apps available in a gallery. All users have to do is in a description of the app they want to make, and the tool will then use different Google models to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once the app is ready, you can navigate into an editor panel to see the visual workflow of input, output, and generation steps. You can click on each workflow step to look at the prompt that dictates the process, and edit it if you need to. You can also manually add steps from Opal’s toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opal also lets users publish their new app on the web and share the link with others to test out using their own Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

Makers of these so-called “vibe-coding” tools are a hot commodity at the moment, with startups like Lovable and Cursor fending off buyers and investors keen to tap a hot trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s now become the latest to hop on this bandwagon: the company is testing a vibe-coding tool called Opal, available to users in the U.S. through Google Labs, which the company uses as a base to experiment with new tech.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opal lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, or you can remix existing apps available in a gallery. All users have to do is in a description of the app they want to make, and the tool will then use different Google models to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once the app is ready, you can navigate into an editor panel to see the visual workflow of input, output, and generation steps. You can click on each workflow step to look at the prompt that dictates the process, and edit it if you need to. You can also manually add steps from Opal’s toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opal also lets users publish their new app on the web and share the link with others to test out using their own Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

Mistake an unconscious AI for a conscious one, and you risk compromising human safety and happiness for the sake of an unthinking, unfeeling hunk of silicon and code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, a small research community has doggedly attacked the question of what consciousness is and how it works. The effort has yielded real progress. And now, with the rapid advance of AI technology, these insights could offer our only guide to the untested, morally fraught waters of artificial consciousness.

Over the past three months, the Qwen team has been hard at work scaling up what they call the “thinking capability” of their AI, aiming to improve both the quality and depth of its reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of their efforts is a model that excels at the really tough stuff: logical reasoning, complex maths, science problems, and advanced coding. In these areas that typically require a human expert, this new Qwen model is now setting the standard for open-source models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On reasoning benchmarks, Qwen’s latest open-source AI model achieves 92.3 on AIME25 and 74.1 on LiveCodeBench v6 for coding. It also holds its own in more general capability tests, scoring 79.7 on Arena-Hard v2, which measures how well it aligns with human preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Benchmarks from the Alibaba Qwen team for their latest Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 open-source reasoning AI model compared to rivals." class="wp-image-107208" height="576" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507-qwen-ai-model-reasoning-benchmarks-alibaba-1024x576.jpeg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its heart, this is a massive reasoning AI model from the Qwen team with 235 billion parameters in total. However, it uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which means it only activates a fraction of those parameters – about 22 billion – at any one time. Think of it like having a huge team of 128 specialists on call, but only the eight best-suited for a specific task are brought in to actually work on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of its most impressive features is its massive memory. Qwen’s open-source reasoning AI model has a native context length of 262,144 tokens; a huge advantage for tasks that involve understanding vast amounts of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the developers and tinkerers out there, the Qwen team has made it easy to get started. The model is available on Hugging Face. You can deploy it using tools like sglang or vllm to create your own API endpoint. The team also points to their Qwen-Agent framework as the best way to make use of the model’s tool-calling skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the best performance from their open-source AI reasoning model, the Qwen team have shared a few tips. They suggest an output length of around 32,768 tokens for most tasks, but for really complex challenges, you should boost that to 81,920 tokens to give the AI enough room to “think”. They also recommend giving the model specific instructions in your prompt, like asking it to “reason step-by-step” for maths problems, to get the most accurate and well-structured answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of this new Qwen model provides a powerful yet open-source reasoning AI that can rival some of the best proprietary models out there, especially when it comes to complex, brain-bending tasks. It will be exciting to see what developers ultimately build with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image by Tung Lam)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Action Plan: US leadership must be ‘unchallenged’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-11874" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
