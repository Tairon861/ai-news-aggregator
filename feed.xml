But there was a different problem emerging, according to Romanus Prabhu Raymond, Director of Technology at ManageEngine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s customers were demanding aggressive containment features, yet automatically quarantining a suspicious hospital computer or bank teller system might prove more devastating than the original threat. The dilemma – balancing rapid threat response with real-world consequences – exemplifies why ethical cybersecurity practices have become one of the defining challenges of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our exclusive interview shortly before his presentation at the Cyber Security Expo in Amsterdam, Raymond revealed how leading organisations are breaking free from the traditional security-versus-privacy trade-off and why the companies embracing this “trust revolution” can reshape enterprise security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, the cybersecurity industry stands at a important juncture. High-profile breaches, evolving regulatory frameworks, and the rapid integration of AI into security systems have created new challenges that extend far beyond technical protection. Organisations now face important questions about how to balance innovation with responsibility, privacy with security, and automation with human oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Defining ethical cybersecurity in the modern era&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Raymond, ethical cybersecurity transcends traditional notions of defence. “Ethical cybersecurity goes beyond defending systems and data – it’s about applying security practices responsibly to protect organisations, individuals, and society at large,” he explained during our interview ahead of his presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025’s cloud-first environment, security isn’t a competitive differentiator, but a baseline expectation. What distinguishes organisations today is how ethically they handle data and implement security measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond uses the analogy of installing security cameras in a neighbourhood to protect public spaces without intruding on private areas; the avoidance of peering into residents’ windows. Cybersecurity must operate under the same principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ManageEngine has operationalised this philosophy through what Raymond calls an “ethical by design” approach, embedding fairness, transparency, and accountability into every product from conception. The company’s stance on customer data exemplifies this commitment: it neither monetises nor monitors customer data, maintaining that it belongs solely to the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The innovation-risk paradox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tension between innovation and risk management represents an important challenge for modern organisations. Push too hard for innovation without adequate safeguards and companies risk data breaches and compliance violations. Focus too heavily on risk mitigation, and organisations may find themselves unable to compete in evolving markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “trust by design” philosophy embeds responsibility and accountability into every development stage, which allows rapid innovation and maintains compliance and ethical standards. When deploying important components like endpoint agents, the company ensures new functionality inherently complies with industry standards and security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method extends to the company’s global operations. ManageEngine maintains datacentres worldwide which align with local privacy and regulatory demands, and trains every employee – from developers to support engineers – to treat customer data with integrity. The company’s “trans-localisation strategy” ensures local teams serve local customers, creating operational efficiency and cultural trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI integration and human oversight&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly central to cybersecurity operations, the ethical implications of AI-driven security solutions have become more complex. Raymond acknowledges that AI is evolving from purely assistive roles to more decisive functions, raising questions about accountability, transparency, and fairness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond expounds ManageEngine’s “SHE AI principles”: Secure AI, Human AI, and Ethical AI. Secure AI involves building robust protections against manipulation and adversarial attacks. Human AI ensures human oversight remains integral to important security actions—for instance, if AI detects a suspicious endpoint, it escalates for human validation rather than automatically removing the device from the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important in sensitive environments like hospitals or banks, where automatically blocking systems could have severe consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ethical AI component emphasises explainability. Rather than generating “black box” alerts, ManageEngine’s systems explain their reasoning. An alert might read: “The endpoint cannot log in at this time and is trying to connect to too many network devices.” This transparency is essential for compliance and building trust in AI-driven security systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Navigating privacy-security trade-offs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balance between necessary security monitoring and privacy invasion represents one of the most delicate aspects of ethical cybersecurity practices. Raymond acknowledges that while proactive monitoring is essential for detecting threats early, over-monitoring risks creating a surveillance environment that treats employees as suspects rather than trusted partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ManageEngine uses principles that emphasise data minimisation, purpose-driven monitoring, anonymisation, and clear governance structures. The company collects only information necessary for security purposes, ensures every piece of data has a defined security use case, uses anonymised data for pattern analysis, and defines data access privileges and retention periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framework demonstrates that security and privacy need not be mutually exclusive when guided by ethics, transparency, and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industry leadership and future challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond argues that technology vendors must act as custodians of digital ethics, earning trust rather than expecting it to be given blindly. ManageEngine says it contributes to industry standards by thought leadership, advocacy, and by embedding compliance standards like ISO 27000 and GDPR into products from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond identifies AI-driven autonomous security and quantum computing as the biggest ethical challenges facing the industry. As security operations centres move toward full autonomy, questions of explainability and accountability become critical. Quantum computing’s ability to break traditional encryption threatens secure communication foundations, while technologies like biometrics raise privacy concerns if not managed carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Practical implementation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For organisations seeking to integrate ethical considerations into their cybersecurity strategies, Raymond recommends three concrete steps: adopting a cybersecurity ethics charter at the board level, embedding privacy and ethics in technology decisions when selecting vendors, and operationalising ethics through comprehensive training and controls that explain not just what to do, but why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the cybersecurity landscape evolves, companies that will thrive are those that recognise ethical cybersecurity practices as the foundation for sustainable, trusted technological advancement, not as constraints on innovation. In the future organisations have to innovate responsibly and maintain human oversight and the ethical principles that digital trust requires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: CERTAIN drives ethical AI compliance in Europe &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for the AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo event series." class="wp-image-109137" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company touted that with this framework, developers gain access to AI models without worrying about any inference cost. Plus, these local models have capabilities such as guided generation and tool calling built in.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As iOS 26 is rolling out to all users, developers have been updating their apps to include features powered by Apple’s local AI models. Apple’s models are small compared with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Meta. That is why local-only features largely improve quality of life with these apps rather than introducing major changes to the app’s workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below are some of the first apps to tap into Apple’s AI framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lil-artist"&gt;Lil Artist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Lil Artist app offers various interactive experiences to help kids learn different skills like creativity, math, and music. Developer Arima Jain and Aman Jain shipped an AI story creator with the iOS 26 update. This allows users to select a character and a theme, with the app generating a story using AI. The developer said that the text generation in the story is powered by the local model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047762" height="451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/screenshot_3x_postspark_2025-09-01_01-19-08.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lil Artist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daylish"&gt;Daylish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The developer of the Daylish app is working on a prototype for automatically suggesting emojis for timeline events based on the title for the daily planner app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moneycoach"&gt;MoneyCoach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finance tracking app MoneyCoach has two neat features powered by local models. First, the app shows insights about your spending, such as whether you spent more than average on groceries for that particular week. The other feature automatically suggests categories and subcategories for a spending item for quick entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of financial tracking app MoneyCoach where the screen shows summary of accounts and shows a weekly insight on grocery spend for the week. " class="wp-image-3047763" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01-Foundation-Models-Insights.jpeg?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;MoneyCoach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lookup"&gt;LookUp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The word learning app LookUp has added two new modes using Apple’s AI models. There is a new learning mode, which leverages a local model to create examples corresponding to a word. Plus, the example asks users to explain the usage of the word in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of LookUp word learning app that shows a screen that displays an example to understand a new word " class="wp-image-3047764" height="400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Learn-Modes-2.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;LookUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The developer is also using on-device models to generate a map view of a word’s origin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Lookup app with a map view showing origin of a word." class="wp-image-3047765" height="400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Etymology-Maps-2.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lookup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tasks"&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just like a few other apps, the Tasks app implemented a feature to suggest tags for an entry using local models automatically. It’s also using these models to detect a recurring task and schedule it accordingly. And the app lets users speak a few things and use the local model to break them down into various tasks without using the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="This is a lifestyle shot of Tasks app showing screen with a new feautre that uses local models to suggest tags when you enter a task." class="wp-image-3047766" height="407" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tasks-app.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-day-one"&gt;Day One&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Automattic-owned journaling app Day One is using Apple’s models to get highlights and suggest titles for your entry. The team has also implemented a feature to generate prompts that nudge you to dive deeper and write more based on what you have already written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot showing Day One journaling app's features implemented using Apple's local model. These features include a summary, title suggestion, and prompt generation to go deeper into writing. " class="wp-image-3047759" height="625" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/On-Device-AI-scaled-1.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Day One&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crouton"&gt;Crouton&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recipe app Crouton is using Apple Intelligence to suggest tags for a recipe and assign names to timers. It also uses AI to break down a block of text into easy-to-follow steps for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signeasy"&gt;SignEasy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Digital signing app SignEasy is using Apple’s local models to extract key insights from a contract and give users a summary of the document they are signing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dark-noise"&gt;Dark Noise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Background sound app Dark Noise has used Apple’s local models to let users describe a soundscape in a few words and generate one based on that. You can adjust the levels of different elements of the soundscape once it is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lights-out"&gt;Lights Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new app to track the F1 season and grand prix from Shihab Mehboob, developer of Twitter client Avery and Mastodon client Mammoth. Lights Out is using on-device AI models to summarize commentary during a race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-capture"&gt;Capture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Note-taking app Capture is using local AI to show category suggestions to users as they type in their notes or tasks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050861" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Capture.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lumy"&gt;Lumy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sun and weather tracking app Lumy now shows neat weather-related suggestions on the app using AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050860" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lumy_image_iPhone_109_cef6.png?w=340" width="340" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Lumy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cardpointers"&gt;Cardpointers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cardpointers is an app that helps you track your credit card expenses and also gives suggestions on the best way to earn points from the cards you have. The app’s new version is using AI to let users ask questions about their cards and offers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050862" height="463" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CardPointers-for-Credit-Cards_image_iPhone_105_eb71.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Cardpointers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-guitar-wiz"&gt;Guitar Wiz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The guitar learning app is using the Apple Foundation Model framework in a few ways. Users will see an explanation of a chord while learning it. The app is showing advanced players’ insights based on time intervals. Plus, the AI model is helping the developer support over 15 languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will continue updating this list as we discover more apps using Apple’s local models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Earlier this year, Apple introduced its Foundation Models framework during WWDC 2025, which allows developers to use the company’s local AI models to power features in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

The developer said that the text generation in the story is powered by the local model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047762" height="451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/screenshot_3x_postspark_2025-09-01_01-19-08.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lil Artist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daylish"&gt;Daylish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The developer of the Daylish app is working on a prototype for automatically suggesting emojis for timeline events based on the title for the daily planner app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moneycoach"&gt;MoneyCoach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finance tracking app MoneyCoach has two neat features powered by local models. First, the app shows insights about your spending, such as whether you spent more than average on groceries for that particular week. The other feature automatically suggests categories and subcategories for a spending item for quick entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of financial tracking app MoneyCoach where the screen shows summary of accounts and shows a weekly insight on grocery spend for the week. " class="wp-image-3047763" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01-Foundation-Models-Insights.jpeg?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;MoneyCoach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lookup"&gt;LookUp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The word learning app LookUp has added two new modes using Apple’s AI models. There is a new learning mode, which leverages a local model to create examples corresponding to a word. Plus, the example asks users to explain the usage of the word in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of LookUp word learning app that shows a screen that displays an example to understand a new word " class="wp-image-3047764" height="400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Learn-Modes-2.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;LookUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The developer is also using on-device models to generate a map view of a word’s origin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Lookup app with a map view showing origin of a word." class="wp-image-3047765" height="400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Etymology-Maps-2.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lookup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tasks"&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just like a few other apps, the Tasks app implemented a feature to suggest tags for an entry using local models automatically. It’s also using these models to detect a recurring task and schedule it accordingly. And the app lets users speak a few things and use the local model to break them down into various tasks without using the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="This is a lifestyle shot of Tasks app showing screen with a new feautre that uses local models to suggest tags when you enter a task." class="wp-image-3047766" height="407" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tasks-app.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-day-one"&gt;Day One&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Automattic-owned journaling app Day One is using Apple’s models to get highlights and suggest titles for your entry. The team has also implemented a feature to generate prompts that nudge you to dive deeper and write more based on what you have already written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot showing Day One journaling app's features implemented using Apple's local model. These features include a summary, title suggestion, and prompt generation to go deeper into writing. " class="wp-image-3047759" height="625" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/On-Device-AI-scaled-1.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Day One&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crouton"&gt;Crouton&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recipe app Crouton is using Apple Intelligence to suggest tags for a recipe and assign names to timers. It also uses AI to break down a block of text into easy-to-follow steps for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signeasy"&gt;SignEasy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Digital signing app SignEasy is using Apple’s local models to extract key insights from a contract and give users a summary of the document they are signing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dark-noise"&gt;Dark Noise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Background sound app Dark Noise has used Apple’s local models to let users describe a soundscape in a few words and generate one based on that. You can adjust the levels of different elements of the soundscape once it is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lights-out"&gt;Lights Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new app to track the F1 season and grand prix from Shihab Mehboob, developer of Twitter client Avery and Mastodon client Mammoth. Lights Out is using on-device AI models to summarize commentary during a race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-capture"&gt;Capture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Note-taking app Capture is using local AI to show category suggestions to users as they type in their notes or tasks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050861" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Capture.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lumy"&gt;Lumy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sun and weather tracking app Lumy now shows neat weather-related suggestions on the app using AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050860" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lumy_image_iPhone_109_cef6.png?w=340" width="340" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Lumy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cardpointers"&gt;Cardpointers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cardpointers is an app that helps you track your credit card expenses and also gives suggestions on the best way to earn points from the cards you have. The app’s new version is using AI to let users ask questions about their cards and offers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050862" height="463" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CardPointers-for-Credit-Cards_image_iPhone_105_eb71.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Cardpointers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-guitar-wiz"&gt;Guitar Wiz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The guitar learning app is using the Apple Foundation Model framework in a few ways. Users will see an explanation of a chord while learning it. The app is showing advanced players’ insights based on time intervals. Plus, the AI model is helping the developer support over 15 languages. &lt;/p&gt;

The video feed of that drone might go to the company’s security team, but it could also be automatically transmitted directly to police departments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The response:&lt;/strong&gt; Flock’s expansion into private-sector security is “a logical step, but in the wrong direction,” says Rebecca Williams, senior strategist for the ACLU’s privacy and data governance unit.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Will Douglas Heaven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of years, OpenAI has felt like a one-man brand. With his showbiz style and fundraising glitz, CEO Sam Altman overshadows all other big names on the firm’s roster.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Altman is not the one building the technology on which its reputation rests. That responsibility falls to OpenAI’s twin heads of research—chief research officer Mark Chen and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki. Between them, they share the role of making sure OpenAI stays one step ahead of powerhouse rivals like Google.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I recently sat down with Chen and Pachocki for an exclusive conversation which covered everything from how they manage the inherent tension between research and product, to what they really mean when they talk about AGI, and what happened to OpenAI’s superalignment team.

In the absence of tech-related spending, the US would be close to, or in, recession this year.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;—George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, warns that the AI boom is unsustainable in a note to clients, Fortune reports.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Headshots of Open AI executives Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki" class="wp-image-1120648" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250724-AI-hero.jpg" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPENAI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The two people shaping the future of OpenAI’s research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Will Douglas Heaven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of years, OpenAI has felt like a one-man brand. With his showbiz style and fundraising glitz, CEO Sam Altman overshadows all other big names on the firm’s roster.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Altman is not the one building the technology on which its reputation rests. That responsibility falls to OpenAI’s twin heads of research—chief research officer Mark Chen and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki. Between them, they share the role of making sure OpenAI stays one step ahead of powerhouse rivals like Google.&lt;/p&gt;
