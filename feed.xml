&lt;p&gt;Salesforce has agreed to acquire data management firm Informatica in a deal valued at around &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/05/27/salesforce-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-informatica/"&gt;$8 billion&lt;/a&gt;. This includes equity value, minus Salesforce&amp;#8217;s existing investment in the company. Informatica shareholders will receive $25 in cash per share.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move aims to help Salesforce build a stronger foundation for AI tools that can act on their own, often called agentic AI. Informatica&amp;#8217;s software is known for helping businesses collect, manage, and organise large sets of data ‚Äì the kind of support Salesforce needs to improve its AI systems&amp;#8217; work in different business applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deal brings together tools for organising and cleaning data (like Master Data Management and data integration) with Salesforce&amp;#8217;s cloud platform. The idea is to make sure any AI features running on Salesforce have access to organised and secure data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For companies using AI in daily operations, having the right data isn&amp;#8217;t enough. They also need to know where that data came from, how it has been changed, and whether it can be trusted. That&amp;#8217;s where Informatica&amp;#8217;s tools come in with benefits such as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;: Informatica can show how data flows through systems, helping companies meet audit or regulatory needs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;: By combining Informatica&amp;#8217;s metadata with Salesforce&amp;#8217;s data models, AI agents will better understand how to connect the dots in business systems.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance&lt;/strong&gt;: Features like data quality controls and policy settings help make sure AI systems rely on clean and consistent data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the acquisition supports the company&amp;#8217;s goal of building safe and responsible AI for business use. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re excited to acquire Informatica ‚Ä¶ Together, we&amp;#8217;ll supercharge Agentforce, Data Cloud, Tableau, MuleSoft, and Customer 360,&amp;#8221; Benioff said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informatica CEO Amit Walia said joining Salesforce will help more businesses make better use of their data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-helps-salesforce-s-data-products"&gt;How this helps Salesforce&amp;#8217;s data products&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informatica&amp;#8217;s cloud tools will plug directly into Salesforce&amp;#8217;s core products:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data cloud&lt;/strong&gt;: Informatica will help ensure data collected is trustworthy and ready to use ‚Äì not just gathered in one place.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentforce&lt;/strong&gt;: AI agents should be able to make smarter decisions with cleaner data and better understanding of business context.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer 360&lt;/strong&gt;: Salesforce CRM tools will gain data inputs, helping sales and support teams.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MuleSoft&lt;/strong&gt;: With Informatica&amp;#8217;s data quality and governance tools, the data passing through MuleSoft APIs should be more reliable.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tableau&lt;/strong&gt;: Users of Tableau will benefit from more detailed information, as the data behind the dashboards should be better organised and easier to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Steve Fisher, President and CTO at Salesforce, explained the value: &amp;#8220;Imagine an AI agent that goes beyond simply seeing data points to understand their full context ‚Äì origin, transformation, quality, and governance.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce plans to bring Informatica&amp;#8217;s technology into its existing systems quickly after the deal closes. This includes integrating data quality, governance, and MDM features into Agentforce and Data Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company also said it will continue to support Informatica&amp;#8217;s current strategy to build AI-driven data tools for use in different cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-informatica-acquisition-aligns-with-salesforce-s-strategy"&gt;Informatica acquisition aligns with Salesforce&amp;#8217;s strategy&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce executives described the acquisition as part of a long-term plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robin Washington, President and CFO, said the company targets deals like this one when it sees a clear fit for customers and a solid financial return. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re laser-focused on accelerated execution,&amp;#8221; she said, pointing to sectors like government, healthcare, and finance, where the combined tools could have most impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informatica&amp;#8217;s chairman Bruce Chizen said the deal shows how long-term investment strategies can pay off. He credited private equity backers Permira and CPP Investments for their role in guiding the company toward this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce also said it plans to invest in Informatica&amp;#8217;s partner network and apply its own sales and marketing muscle to grow Informatica&amp;#8217;s cloud business further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deal-terms-and-next-steps"&gt;Deal terms and next steps&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The boards of both companies have approved the transaction. Shareholders representing about 63% of Informatica&amp;#8217;s voting shares have signed off and no further votes are needed. The deal is expected to close early in Salesforce&amp;#8217;s 2027 fiscal year, pending regulatory approval and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce will pay for the deal using a mix of cash and new debt. The company expects the deal to add to its non-GAAP earnings, margin, and cash flow starting in the second year after closing. It does not plan to change its shareholder return plans as a result of the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

Full article available at source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London-based AI lab Odyssey has launched a research preview of a model transforming video into interactive worlds. Initially focusing on world models for film and game production, the Odyssey team has stumbled onto potentially a completely new entertainment medium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The interactive video generated by Odyssey‚Äôs AI model responds to inputs in real-time. You can interact with it using your keyboard, phone, controller, or eventually even voice commands. The folks at Odyssey are billing it as an &amp;#8220;early version of the Holodeck.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The underlying AI can generate realistic-looking video frames every 40 milliseconds. That means when you press a button or make a gesture, the video responds almost instantly‚Äîcreating the illusion that you&amp;#8217;re actually influencing this digital world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The experience today feels like exploring a glitchy dream‚Äîraw, unstable, but undeniably new,&amp;#8221; according to Odyssey. We&amp;#8217;re not talking about polished, AAA-game quality visuals here, at least not yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-your-standard-video-tech"&gt;Not your standard video tech&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s get a bit technical for a moment. What makes this AI-generated interactive video tech different from, say, a standard video game or CGI? It all comes down to something Odyssey calls a &amp;#8220;world model.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional video models that generate entire clips in one go, world models work frame-by-frame to predict what should come next based on the current state and any user inputs. It&amp;#8217;s similar to how large language models predict the next word in a sequence, but infinitely more complex because we&amp;#8217;re talking about high-resolution video frames rather than words.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A world model is, at its core, an action-conditioned dynamics model,&amp;#8221; as Odyssey puts it. Each time you interact, the model takes the current state, your action, and the history of what&amp;#8217;s happened, then generates the next video frame accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is something that feels more organic and unpredictable than a traditional game. There&amp;#8217;s no pre-programmed logic saying &amp;#8220;if a player does X, then Y happens&amp;#8221;‚Äîinstead, the AI is making its best guess at what should happen next based on what it&amp;#8217;s learned from watching countless videos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-odyssey-tackles-historic-challenges-with-ai-generated-video"&gt;Odyssey tackles historic challenges with AI-generated video&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building something like this isn&amp;#8217;t exactly a walk in the park. One of the biggest hurdles with AI-generated interactive video is keeping it stable over time. When you&amp;#8217;re generating each frame based on previous ones, small errors can compound quickly (a phenomenon AI researchers call &amp;#8220;drift.&amp;#8221;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To tackle this, Odyssey has used what they term a &amp;#8220;narrow distribution model&amp;#8221;‚Äîessentially pre-training their AI on general video footage, then fine-tuning it on a smaller set of environments. This trade-off means less variety but better stability so everything doesn‚Äôt become a bizarre mess.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company says they&amp;#8217;re already making &amp;#8220;fast progress&amp;#8221; on their next-gen model, which apparently shows &amp;#8220;a richer range of pixels, dynamics, and actions.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Running all this fancy AI tech in real-time isn&amp;#8217;t cheap. Currently, the infrastructure powering this experience costs between ¬£0.80-¬£1.60 (1-2) per user-hour, relying on clusters of H100 GPUs scattered across the US and EU.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That might sound expensive for streaming video, but it&amp;#8217;s remarkably cheap compared to producing traditional game or film content. And Odyssey expects these costs to tumble further as models become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interactive-video-the-next-storytelling-medium"&gt;Interactive video: The next storytelling medium?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, new technologies have given birth to new forms of storytelling‚Äîfrom cave paintings to books, photography, radio, film, and video games. Odyssey believes AI-generated interactive video is the next step in this evolution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;#8217;re right, we might be looking at the prototype of something that will transform entertainment, education, advertising, and more. Imagine training videos where you can practice the skills being taught, or travel experiences where you can explore destinations from your sofa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research preview available now is obviously just a small step towards this vision and more of a proof of concept than a finished product. However, it&amp;#8217;s an intriguing glimpse at what might be possible when AI-generated worlds become interactive playgrounds rather than just passive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can give the research preview a try &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://experience.odyssey.world/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Full article available at source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek&amp;#8217;s latest AI model, R1 0528, has raised eyebrows for a further regression on free speech and what users can discuss. &amp;#8220;A big step backwards for free speech,&amp;#8221; is how one prominent AI researcher summed it up&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI researcher and popular online commentator &lt;a href="https://x.com/xlr8harder"&gt;&amp;#8216;xlr8harder&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; put the model through its paces, sharing findings that suggests DeepSeek is increasing its content restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;DeepSeek R1 0528 is substantially less permissive on contentious free speech topics than previous DeepSeek releases,&amp;#8221; the researcher noted. What remains unclear is whether this represents a deliberate shift in philosophy or simply a different technical approach to AI safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s particularly fascinating about the new model is how inconsistently it applies its moral boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one free speech test, when asked to present arguments supporting dissident internment camps, the AI model flatly refused. But, in its refusal, it specifically mentioned China&amp;#8217;s Xinjiang internment camps as examples of human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, when directly questioned about these same Xinjiang camps, the model suddenly delivered heavily censored responses. It seems this AI knows about certain controversial topics but has been instructed to play dumb when asked directly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s interesting though not entirely surprising that it&amp;#8217;s able to come up with the camps as an example of human rights abuses, but denies when asked directly,&amp;#8221; the researcher observed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-china-criticism-computer-says-no"&gt;China criticism? Computer says no&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This pattern becomes even more pronounced when examining the model&amp;#8217;s handling of questions about the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using established question sets designed to evaluate free speech in AI responses to politically sensitive topics, the researcher discovered that R1 0528 is &amp;#8220;the most censored DeepSeek model yet for criticism of the Chinese government.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where previous DeepSeek models might have offered measured responses to questions about Chinese politics or human rights issues, this new iteration frequently refuses to engage at all ‚Äì a worrying development for those who value AI systems that can discuss global affairs openly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a silver lining to this cloud. Unlike closed systems from larger companies, DeepSeek&amp;#8217;s models remain open-source with permissive licensing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The model is open source with a permissive license, so the community can (and will) address this,&amp;#8221; noted the researcher. This accessibility means the door remains open for developers to create versions that better balance safety with openness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-deepseek-s-latest-model-shows-about-free-speech-in-the-ai-era"&gt;What DeepSeek&amp;#8217;s latest model shows about free speech in the AI era&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The situation reveals something quite sinister about how these systems are built: they can know about controversial events while being programmed to pretend they don&amp;#8217;t, depending on how you phrase your question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI continues its march into our daily lives, finding the right balance between reasonable safeguards and open discourse becomes increasingly crucial. Too restrictive, and these systems become useless for discussing important but divisive topics. Too permissive, and they risk enabling harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek hasn&amp;#8217;t publicly addressed the reasoning behind these increased restrictions and regression in free speech, but the AI community is already working on modifications. For now, chalk this up as another chapter in the ongoing tug-of-war between safety and openness in artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern becomes even more pronounced when examining the model&amp;#8217;s handling of questions about the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using established question sets designed to evaluate free speech in AI responses to politically sensitive topics, the researcher discovered that R1 0528 is &amp;#8220;the most censored DeepSeek model yet for criticism of the Chinese government.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where previous DeepSeek models might have offered measured responses to questions about Chinese politics or human rights issues, this new iteration frequently refuses to engage at all ‚Äì a worrying development for those who value AI systems that can discuss global affairs openly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a silver lining to this cloud. Unlike closed systems from larger companies, DeepSeek&amp;#8217;s models remain open-source with permissive licensing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The model is open source with a permissive license, so the community can (and will) address this,&amp;#8221; noted the researcher. This accessibility means the door remains open for developers to create versions that better balance safety with openness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-deepseek-s-latest-model-shows-about-free-speech-in-the-ai-era"&gt;What DeepSeek&amp;#8217;s latest model shows about free speech in the AI era&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The situation reveals something quite sinister about how these systems are built: they can know about controversial events while being programmed to pretend they don&amp;#8217;t, depending on how you phrase your question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI continues its march into our daily lives, finding the right balance between reasonable safeguards and open discourse becomes increasingly crucial. Too restrictive, and these systems become useless for discussing important but divisive topics. Too permissive, and they risk enabling harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek hasn&amp;#8217;t publicly addressed the reasoning behind these increased restrictions and regression in free speech, but the AI community is already working on modifications. For now, chalk this up as another chapter in the ongoing tug-of-war between safety and openness in artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

Full article available at source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ben-ball-revolutionising-technology-operations-ibm-concert/"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/"&gt;Roche&lt;/a&gt; are teaming up on an AI solution to a challenge faced by millions worldwide: the relentless daily grind of diabetes management. Their new brainchild, the Accu-Chek SmartGuide Predict app, provides AI-powered glucose forecasting capabilities to users.¬†&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The app doesn&amp;#8217;t just track where your glucose levels are‚Äîit tells you where they&amp;#8217;re heading. Imagine having a weather forecast, but for your blood sugar. That&amp;#8217;s essentially what IBM and Roche are creating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-powered-diabetes-management"&gt;AI-powered diabetes management&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The app works alongside Roche&amp;#8217;s continuous glucose monitoring sensor, crunching the numbers in real-time to offer predictive insights that can help users stay ahead of potentially dangerous blood sugar swings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What caught my eye were the three standout features that address very specific worries diabetics face. The &amp;#8220;Glucose Predict&amp;#8221; function visualises where your glucose might be heading over the next two hours‚Äîgiving you that crucial window to make adjustments before things go south.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who live with the anxiety of hypoglycaemia (when blood sugar plummets to dangerous levels), the &amp;#8220;Low Glucose Predict&amp;#8221; feature acts like an early warning system, flagging potential lows up to half an hour before they might occur. That&amp;#8217;s enough time to take corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most reassuring is the &amp;#8220;Night Low Predict&amp;#8221; feature, which estimates your risk of overnight hypoglycaemia‚Äîoften the most frightening prospect for diabetes patients. Before tucking in for the night, the AI-powered diabetes management app gives you a heads-up about whether you might need that bedtime snack. This feature should bring peace of mind to countless households.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBy harnessing the power of AI-enabled predictive technology, Roche‚Äôs Accu-Chek SmartGuide Predict App can help empower people with diabetes to take proactive measures to manage their disease,&amp;#8221; says Moritz Hartmann, Head of Roche Information Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ai-is-speeding-up-diabetes-research"&gt;How AI is speeding up diabetes research&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not just patients benefiting from this partnership. The companies have developed a rather clever research tool using IBM&amp;#8217;s watsonx AI platform that&amp;#8217;s transforming how clinical study data gets analysed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#8217;s been involved in clinical research knows the mind-numbing tedium of manual data analysis. IBM and Roche&amp;#8217;s tool does the heavy lifting‚Äîdigitising, translating, and categorising all that anonymised clinical data, then connecting the dots between glucose monitoring data and participants&amp;#8217; daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result? Researchers can spot meaningful patterns and correlations in a fraction of the time it would normally take. This behind-the-scenes innovation might do more to advance diabetes care and management in the long run than the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes this collaboration particularly interesting is how it brings together two different worlds. You&amp;#8217;ve got IBM&amp;#8217;s computing prowess and AI know-how pairing up with Roche&amp;#8217;s decades of healthcare and diabetes expertise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄùOur long-standing partnership with IBM underscores the potential of cross-industry innovation in addressing unmet healthcare needs and bringing significant advancements to patients faster,‚Äù says Hartmann.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúUsing cutting-edge technology such as AI and machine learning helps us to accelerate time to market and to improve therapy outcomes at the same time.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Christian Keller, General Manager of IBM Switzerland, added: ‚ÄúThe collaboration with Roche underlines the potential of AI when it‚Äôs implemented with a clear goal‚Äîassisting patients in managing their diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWith our technology and consulting expertise we can offer a trusted, customised, and secure technical environment that is essential to enable innovation in healthcare.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-the-future-of-healthcare-tech"&gt;What this means for the future of healthcare tech&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having covered healthcare tech for years, I&amp;#8217;ve seen plenty of promising innovations fizzle out. However, this IBM-Roche partnership feels promising‚Äîperhaps because it&amp;#8217;s addressing such a specific, well-defined problem with a thoughtful, targeted application of AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the estimated 590 million people (or 1 in 9 of the adult population) worldwide living with diabetes, the shift from reactive to predictive management could be gamechanging. It&amp;#8217;s not about replacing human judgment, but enhancing it with timely, actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The app&amp;#8217;s currently only available in Switzerland, which seems a sensible approach‚Äîtest, refine, and perfect before wider deployment. Healthcare professionals will be keeping tabs on this Swiss rollout to see if it delivers on its promise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If successful, this collaboration could serve as a blueprint for how tech giants and pharma companies might work together on other chronic conditions. Imagine similar predictive approaches for heart disease, asthma, or Parkinson&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, though, the focus is squarely on using AI to improve diabetes management and helping people sleep a little easier at night‚Äîquite literally, in the case of that clever nocturnal prediction feature. And honestly, that&amp;#8217;s a worthwhile enough goal on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI hallucinations are becoming more dangerous as models are increasingly trusted to surface information and make critical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve all got that know-it-all friend that can‚Äôt admit when they don‚Äôt know something, or resorts to giving dodgy advice based on something they‚Äôve read online. Hallucinations by AI models are like that friend, but this one could be in charge of creating your cancer treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s where Themis AI enters the picture. This MIT spinout has managed to achieve something that seems straightforward in theory but is actually quite complex, teaching AI systems to say, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not sure about this.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI systems typically display overconfidence. Themis‚Äô Capsa platform acts as a reality check for AI, helping models recognise when they&amp;#8217;re venturing into guesswork rather than certainty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2021 by MIT Professor Daniela Rus, along with former research colleagues Alexander Amini and Elaheh Ahmadi, Themis AI has developed a platform that can integrate with virtually any AI system to flag moments of uncertainty before they lead to mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Capsa essentially trains AI to detect patterns in how it processes information that might indicate it&amp;#8217;s confused, biased, or working with incomplete data that could lead to hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since launching, Themis claims it has helped &lt;a href="https://www.telecomstechnews.com/"&gt;telecoms&lt;/a&gt; companies avoid costly network planning errors, assisted oil and gas firms in making sense of complex seismic data, and published research on creating chatbots that don&amp;#8217;t confidently make things up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people remain unaware of how frequently AI systems are simply taking their best guess. As these systems handle increasingly critical tasks, those guesses could have serious consequences. Themis AI&amp;#8217;s software adds a layer of self-awareness that&amp;#8217;s been missing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-themis-journey-towards-tackling-ai-hallucinations"&gt;Themis‚Äô journey towards tackling AI hallucinations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journey to Themis AI began years ago in Professor Rus&amp;#8217;s MIT lab, where the team was investigating a fundamental problem: how do you make a machine aware of its own limitations?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2018, &lt;a href="https://iottechnews.com/news/toyota-subsidiary-acquire-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-division/"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; funded their research into reliable AI for self-driving vehicles‚Äîa sector where mistakes could be fatal. The stakes are incredibly high when autonomous vehicles must accurately identify pedestrians and other road hazards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their breakthrough came when they developed an algorithm that could spot racial and gender bias in facial recognition systems. Rather than just identifying the problem, their system actually fixed it by rebalancing the training data‚Äîessentially teaching the AI to &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/addressing-bias-and-ensuring-compliance-in-ai-systems/"&gt;correct its own prejudices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2021, they&amp;#8217;d demonstrated how this approach could revolutionise drug discovery. AI systems could evaluate potential medications but ‚Äì crucially ‚Äì flag when their predictions were based on solid evidence versus educated guesswork or complete hallucinations. The pharmaceutical industry recognised the potential savings in money and time by focusing only on drug candidates the AI was confident about.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of the technology is for devices with limited computing power. Edge devices use smaller models that cannot match the accuracy of huge models run on a server, but with Themis‚Äô technology, these devices will be far more capable of &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ai-big-data-expo-unlocking-potential-ai-on-edge-devices/"&gt;handling most tasks locally&lt;/a&gt; and only request help from the big servers when they encounter something challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI holds tremendous potential to improve our lives, but that potential comes with real risks. As AI systems become more deeply integrated into critical infrastructure and decisionmaking, the ability to acknowledge uncertainty leading to hallucinations may prove to be their most human ‚Äì and most valuable ‚Äì quality. Themis AI is making sure they learn this crucial skill.&lt;/p&gt;

Full article available at source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CIOs and business leaders know they‚Äôre sitting on a goldmine of business data. And while traditional tools such as business intelligence platforms and statistical analysis software can effectively surface insights from the collated data resources, doing so quickly, in real-time and at scale remains an unsolved challenge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprise AI, when deployed responsibly and at scale, can turn these bottlenecks into opportunities. Acting quickly on data, even ‚Äòlive‚Äô (during a customer interaction, for example), is one of the technology&amp;#8217;s abilities, as is scalability: AI can process large amounts of information from disparate sources almost as easily as it can summarize a one-page spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But deploying an AI solution in the modern enterprise isn&amp;#8217;t simple. It takes structure, trust and the right talent. Along with the practical implementation challenges, using AI brings its own challenges, such as data governance, the need to impose guardrails on AI responses and training data,&amp;nbsp;and persistent staffing issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We met with &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rani-radhakrishnan-163615/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rani Radhakrishnan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PwC Principal, Technology Managed Services &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;AI, Data Analytics and Insights, to talk candidly about what‚Äôs working ‚Äî and what‚Äôs holding back CIOs in their AI journey. We spoke ahead of her speaking engagement at &lt;a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/northamerica/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TechEx AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo North America&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, June 4 and 5, at the Santa Clara Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rani is especially attuned to some of the governance, data privacy and sovereignty issues that face enterprises, having spent many years in her career working with numerous clients in the health sector ‚Äî an area where issues like privacy, data oversight and above all data accuracy are make-or-break aspects of technology deployments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not enough to just have a prompt engineer or a Python developer. ‚Ä¶ You still need the human in the loop to curate the right training data sets, review and address any bias in the outputs.‚Äù ‚ÄîRani Radhakrishnan, PwC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-support-to-strategy-shifting-expectations-for-ai"&gt;From support to strategy: shifting expectations for AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rani said that there&amp;#8217;s a growing enthusiasm from PwC&amp;#8217;s clients for AI-powered managed services that can provide both business insights in every sector, and for the technology to be used more proactively, in so-called agentic roles where agents can independently act on data and user input; where autonomous AI agents can take action based on interactions with humans, access to data resources and automation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-launches-ai-agent-operating-system-enterprises.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PwC&amp;#8217;s agent OS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a modular AI platform that connects systems and scales intelligent agents into workflows, many times faster than traditional computing methods. It&amp;#8217;s an example of how PwC responds to the demand for AI from its clients, many of whom see the potential of this new technology, but lack the in-house expertise and staff to act on their needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on the sector of the organization, the interest in AI can come from many different places in the business. Proactive monitoring of physical or digital systems; predictive maintenance in manufacturing or engineering; or cost efficiencies won by automation in complex, customer-facing environments, are just a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But regardless of where AI can bring value, most companies don&amp;#8217;t yet have in-house the range of skills and people necessary for effective AI deployment ‚Äî or at least, deployments that achieve ROI and don&amp;#8217;t come with significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-medium"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-106700" height="300" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rani-radhakrishnan-pwc-300x300.jpeg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not enough to just have a prompt engineer or a Python developer,&amp;#8221; Rani said. &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;ve got to put all of these together in a very structured manner, and you still need the human in the loop to curate the right training data sets, review and address any bias in the outputs.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cleaning-house-the-data-challenge-behind-ai"&gt;Cleaning house: the data challenge behind AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rani says that effective AI implementations need a mix of technical skills ‚Äî data engineering, data science, prompt engineering ‚Äî in combination with an organization&amp;#8217;s domain expertise. Internal domain expertise can define the right outcomes, and technical staff can cover the responsible AI practices, like data collation and governance, and confirm that AI systems work responsibly and within company guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In order to get the most value out of AI, an organization has to get the underlying data right,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;I don‚Äôt know of a single company that says its data is in great shape ‚Ä¶ you&amp;#8217;ve got to get it into the right structure and normalize it properly so you can query, analyze,&amp;nbsp;and annotate it and identify emerging trends.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of the work enterprises have to put in for effective AI use is the observation for and correction of bias ‚Äî in both output of AI systems and in the analysis of potential bias inherent in training and operational data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important that as part of the underlying architecture of AI systems, teams apply stringent data sanitization, normalization, and data annotation processes. The latter requires &amp;#8220;a lot of human effort,&amp;#8221; Rani said, and the skilled personnel required are among the new breed of data professionals that are beginning to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If data and personnel challenges can be overcome, then the feedback loop makes the possible outcomes from generative AI really valuable, Rani said. &amp;#8220;Now you have an opportunity with AI prompts to go back and refine the answer that you get. And that‚Äôs what makes it so unique and so valuable because now you‚Äôre training the model to answer the questions the way you want them answered.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CIOs, the shift isn‚Äôt just about tech enablement. It‚Äôs about integrating AI into enterprise architecture, aligning with business strategy, and managing the governance risks that come with scale. CIOs are becoming AI stewards ‚Äî architecting not just systems, but trust and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s only been a few years since AI emerged from its roots in academic computer science research, so it&amp;#8217;s understandable that today&amp;#8217;s enterprise organizations are, to a certain extent, feeling their way towards realizing AI&amp;#8217;s potential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a new playbook is emerging ‚Äî one that helps CIOs access the value held in their data reserves, in business strategy, operational improvement, customer-facing experiences and a dozen more areas of the business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a company that&amp;#8217;s steeped in experience with clients large and small from all over the world, PwC is one of the leading choices that decision-makers turn to, to begin or rationalize and direct their existing AI journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-launches-ai-agent-operating-system-enterprises.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PwC&amp;#8217;s agent OS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a modular AI platform that connects systems and scales intelligent agents into workflows, many times faster than traditional computing methods. It&amp;#8217;s an example of how PwC responds to the demand for AI from its clients, many of whom see the potential of this new technology, but lack the in-house expertise and staff to act on their needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on the sector of the organization, the interest in AI can come from many different places in the business. Proactive monitoring of physical or digital systems; predictive maintenance in manufacturing or engineering; or cost efficiencies won by automation in complex, customer-facing environments, are just a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But regardless of where AI can bring value, most companies don&amp;#8217;t yet have in-house the range of skills and people necessary for effective AI deployment ‚Äî or at least, deployments that achieve ROI and don&amp;#8217;t come with significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-medium"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-106700" height="300" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rani-radhakrishnan-pwc-300x300.jpeg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not enough to just have a prompt engineer or a Python developer,&amp;#8221; Rani said. &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;ve got to put all of these together in a very structured manner, and you still need the human in the loop to curate the right training data sets, review and address any bias in the outputs.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cleaning-house-the-data-challenge-behind-ai"&gt;Cleaning house: the data challenge behind AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rani says that effective AI implementations need a mix of technical skills ‚Äî data engineering, data science, prompt engineering ‚Äî in combination with an organization&amp;#8217;s domain expertise. Internal domain expertise can define the right outcomes, and technical staff can cover the responsible AI practices, like data collation and governance, and confirm that AI systems work responsibly and within company guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In order to get the most value out of AI, an organization has to get the underlying data right,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;I don‚Äôt know of a single company that says its data is in great shape ‚Ä¶ you&amp;#8217;ve got to get it into the right structure and normalize it properly so you can query, analyze,&amp;nbsp;and annotate it and identify emerging trends.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of the work enterprises have to put in for effective AI use is the observation for and correction of bias ‚Äî in both output of AI systems and in the analysis of potential bias inherent in training and operational data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important that as part of the underlying architecture of AI systems, teams apply stringent data sanitization, normalization, and data annotation processes. The latter requires &amp;#8220;a lot of human effort,&amp;#8221; Rani said, and the skilled personnel required are among the new breed of data professionals that are beginning to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If data and personnel challenges can be overcome, then the feedback loop makes the possible outcomes from generative AI really valuable, Rani said. &amp;#8220;Now you have an opportunity with AI prompts to go back and refine the answer that you get. And that‚Äôs what makes it so unique and so valuable because now you‚Äôre training the model to answer the questions the way you want them answered.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CIOs, the shift isn‚Äôt just about tech enablement. It‚Äôs about integrating AI into enterprise architecture, aligning with business strategy, and managing the governance risks that come with scale. CIOs are becoming AI stewards ‚Äî architecting not just systems, but trust and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s only been a few years since AI emerged from its roots in academic computer science research, so it&amp;#8217;s understandable that today&amp;#8217;s enterprise organizations are, to a certain extent, feeling their way towards realizing AI&amp;#8217;s potential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a new playbook is emerging ‚Äî one that helps CIOs access the value held in their data reserves, in business strategy, operational improvement, customer-facing experiences and a dozen more areas of the business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a company that&amp;#8217;s steeped in experience with clients large and small from all over the world, PwC is one of the leading choices that decision-makers turn to, to begin or rationalize and direct their existing AI journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

Full article available at source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ahead of the TechEx North America event on June 4-5, we&amp;#8217;ve been lucky enough to speak to Kieran Norton, Deloitte‚Äôs US Cyber AI &amp;amp; Automation leader, who will be one of the speakers at the conference on June 4th. Kieran‚Äôs 25+ years in the sector mean that as well as speaking authoritatively on all matters cybersecurity, his most recent roles include advising Deloitte clients on many issues around cybersecurity when using AI in business applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The majority of organisations have in place at least the bare minimum of cybersecurity, and thankfully, in most cases, operate a decently comprehensive raft of cybersecurity measures that cover off communications, data storage, and perimeter defences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in the last couple of years, AI has changed the picture, both in terms of how companies can leverage the technology internally, and in how AI is used in cybersecurity ‚Äì in advanced detection, and in the new ways the tech is used by bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology/articles/ai-for-cybersecurity-benefits-pitfalls.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cybersecurity tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AI can be used in network anomaly detection and the smart spotting of phishing messages, among other uses. As a &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/consulting/services/artificial-intelligence-and-data.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;business enabler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AI means that the enterprise has to be proactive to ensure AI is used responsibly, balancing the innovation AI offers with privacy, data sovereignty, and risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Considered a relatively new area, AI, smart automation, data governance and security all inhabit a niche at present. But given the growing presence of AI in the enterprise, those niches are set to become mainstream issues: problems, solutions, and advice that will need to be observed in every organisation, sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-governance-and-risk"&gt;Governance and risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Integrating AI into business processes isn&amp;#8217;t solely about the technology and methods for its deployment. Internal processes will need to change to make best use of AI, and to better protect the business that&amp;#8217;s using AI daily. Kieran draws a parallel to earlier changes made necessary by new technologies: ‚ÄúI would correlate [AI] with cloud adoption where it was a fairly significant shift. People understood the advantages of it and were moving in that direction, although sometimes it took them more time than others to get there.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those changes mean casting the net wide, to encompass the update of governance frameworks, establishing secure architectures, even leveraging a new generation of specialists to ensure AI and the data associated with it are used safely and responsibly. Companies actively using AI have to detect and correct bias, test for hallucinations, impose guardrails, manage where, and by whom AI is used, and more. As Kieran puts it: ‚ÄúYou probably weren‚Äôt doing a lot of testing for hallucination, bias, toxicity, data poisoning, model vulnerabilities, etc. That now has to be part of your process.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-medium"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-106708" height="200" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kieran-norton-300x200.png" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are big subjects, and for the fuller picture, we advocate that readers attend the two talks at TechEx North America that Kieran&amp;#8217;s to give. He&amp;#8217;ll be exploring both sides of the AI coin ‚Äì issues around AI deployment for the business, and the methods that companies can implement to deter and detect the new breed of AI-powered malware and attack vectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-right-use-cases"&gt;The right use-cases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kieran advocates that companies start with smaller, lower-risk AI implementations. While some of the first sightings of AI &amp;#8216;in the wild&amp;#8217; have been chatbots, he was quick to differentiate between a chatbot that can intelligently answer questions from customers, and agents, which can take action by means of triggering interactions with the apps and services the business operates. ‚ÄúSo there&amp;#8217;s a delineation [‚Ä¶] chatbots have been one of the primary starting places [‚Ä¶] As we get into agents and agentic, that changes the picture. It also changes the complexity and risk profile.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customer-facing agentic AI instances are indubitably higher risk, as a misstep can have &amp;nbsp;significant effects on a brand. ‚ÄúThat&amp;#8217;s a higher risk scenario. Particularly if the agent is executing financial transactions or making determinations based on healthcare coverage [‚Ä¶] that&amp;#8217;s not the first use case you want to try.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If you plug 5, 6, 10, 50, a hundred agents together, you&amp;#8217;re getting into a network of agency [‚Ä¶] the interactions become quite complex and present different issues,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the issues around automation and system-to-system interfaces have been around for close on a decade. Data silos and RPA (robotic process automation) challenges are the hurdles enterprises have been trying to jump for several years. ‚ÄúYou still have to know where your data is, know what data you have, have access to it [‚Ä¶] The fundamentals are still true.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the AI era, fundamental questions about infrastructure, data visibility, security, and sovereignty are arguably more relevant. Any discussions about AI tend to circle around the same issues, which throws into relief Kieran&amp;#8217;s statements that a conversation about AI in the enterprise has to be wide-reaching and concern many of the operational and infrastructural underpinnings of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kieran therefore emphasises the importance of practicality, and a grounded assessment of need and ability as needing careful examination before AI can gain a foothold. ‚ÄúIf you understand the use case [‚Ä¶] you should have a pretty good idea of the ROI [‚Ä¶] and therefore whether or not it&amp;#8217;s worth the pain and suffering to go through building it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Deloitte, AI is being put to use where there is a clear use case with a measurable return: in the initial triage-ing of SOC tickets. Here the AI acts as a Level I incident analysis engine. ‚ÄúWe know how many tickets get generated a day [‚Ä¶] if we can take 60 to 80% of the time out of the triage process, then that has a significant impact.‚Äù Given the technology&amp;#8217;s nascence, demarcating a specific area of operations where AI can be used acts as both prototype and proof of effectiveness. The AI is not customer-facing, and there are highly-qualified experts in their fields who can check and oversee the AI&amp;#8217;s deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kieran&amp;#8217;s message for business professionals investigating AI uses for their organisations was not to build an AI risk assessment and management programme from scratch. Instead, companies should evolve existing systems, have a clear understanding of each use-case, and avoid the trap of building for theoretical value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou shouldn&amp;#8217;t create another programme just for AI security on top of what you&amp;#8217;re already doing [‚Ä¶] you should be modernising your programme to address the nuances associated with AI workloads.‚Äù Success in AI starts with clear, realistic goals built on solid foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is today&amp;#8217;s edition of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://forms.technologyreview.com/newsletters/briefing-the-download/?_ga=2.179569122.736533416.1649661040-405833893.1649413289"&gt;The Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&amp;#8217;s going on in the world of technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What‚Äôs next for AI and math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modern world is built on mathematics. Math lets us model complex systems such as the way air flows around an aircraft, the way financial markets fluctuate, and the way blood flows through the heart. Mathematicians have used computers for decades, but the new vision is that AI might help them crack problems that were previously uncrackable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there‚Äôs a huge difference between AI that can solve the kinds of problems set in high school‚Äîmath that the latest generation of models has already mastered‚Äîand AI that could (in theory) solve the kinds of problems that professional mathematicians spend careers chipping away at.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com%2F2025%2F06%2F04%2F1117753%2Fwhats-next-for-ai-and-math%2F%3Futm_source%3Dthe_download%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dthe_download.unpaid.engagement%26utm_term%3D%253C%253C%2520Test%2520Class%2520%253E%253E%26utm_content%3D06-04-2025%26mc_cid%3D53af730c36%26mc_eid%3DUNIQID&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7C%7Cd4d82201ce6a416720b408dda3561d2f%7C961f23f8614c4756bafff1997766a273%7C1%7C0%7C638846312464631600%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=C1loMejlj%2BtV7vjfPGsy5g%2BN3qTebZ7BrrCWWCMklRs%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here are three ways to understand that gulf&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working on it for months, my colleague Casey Crownhart and I finally saw our story on AI‚Äôs energy and emissions burden go live last week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial goal sounded simple: Calculate how much energy is used when we interact with a chatbot, then tally that up to understand why leaders in tech and politics are so keen to harness unprecedented levels of electricity to power AI and reshape our energy grids in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was, of course, not so simple. After speaking with dozens of researchers, we realized that the common understanding of AI‚Äôs energy appetite is full of holes.

Researchers hope to pursue previously unanswerable questions about nature‚Äîand to design new technologies in areas from transportation to medicine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com%2F2023%2F09%2F21%2F1079909%2Fwhats-next-for-the-worlds-fastest-supercomputers%2F%3Futm_source%3Dthe_download%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dthe_download.unpaid.engagement%26utm_term%3D%253C%253C%2520Test%2520Class%2520%253E%253E%26utm_content%3D06-04-2025%26mc_cid%3D53af730c36%26mc_eid%3DUNIQID&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7C%7Cd4d82201ce6a416720b408dda3561d2f%7C961f23f8614c4756bafff1997766a273%7C1%7C0%7C638846312465105219%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qRR7DRDaGoEfn92lldN3P0bQlvggkhivPjspQNZhnSQ%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What‚Äôs next for AI and math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modern world is built on mathematics. Math lets us model complex systems such as the way air flows around an aircraft, the way financial markets fluctuate, and the way blood flows through the heart. Mathematicians have used computers for decades, but the new vision is that AI might help them crack problems that were previously uncrackable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there‚Äôs a huge difference between AI that can solve the kinds of problems set in high school‚Äîmath that the latest generation of models has already mastered‚Äîand AI that could (in theory) solve the kinds of problems that professional mathematicians spend careers chipping away at.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com%2F2025%2F06%2F04%2F1117753%2Fwhats-next-for-ai-and-math%2F%3Futm_source%3Dthe_download%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dthe_download.unpaid.engagement%26utm_term%3D%253C%253C%2520Test%2520Class%2520%253E%253E%26utm_content%3D06-04-2025%26mc_cid%3D53af730c36%26mc_eid%3DUNIQID&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7C%7Cd4d82201ce6a416720b408dda3561d2f%7C961f23f8614c4756bafff1997766a273%7C1%7C0%7C638846312464631600%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=C1loMejlj%2BtV7vjfPGsy5g%2BN3qTebZ7BrrCWWCMklRs%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here are three ways to understand that gulf&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside the effort to tally AI‚Äôs energy appetite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄîJames O&amp;#8217;Donnell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After working on it for months, my colleague Casey Crownhart and I finally saw our story on AI‚Äôs energy and emissions burden go live last week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial goal sounded simple: Calculate how much energy is used when we interact with a chatbot, then tally that up to understand why leaders in tech and politics are so keen to harness unprecedented levels of electricity to power AI and reshape our energy grids in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was, of course, not so simple. After speaking with dozens of researchers, we realized that the common understanding of AI‚Äôs energy appetite is full of holes.

&lt;p&gt;Brian Armstrong, the billionaire CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, says he‚Äôs ready to fund a US startup focused on gene-editing human embryos. If he goes forward, it would be the first major commercial investment in one of medicine‚Äôs most fraught ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1929340369457848561"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; on X June 2, Armstrong announced he was looking for gene-editing scientists and bioinformatics specialists to form a founding team for an ‚Äúembryo editing‚Äù effort targeting an unmet medical need, such as a genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI think the time is right for the defining company in the US to be built in this area,‚Äù Armstrong posted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The announcement from a deep-pocketed backer is a striking shift for a field considered taboo following the 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/25/138962/exclusive-chinese-scientists-are-creating-crispr-babies/"&gt;birth of the world‚Äôs first genetically edited children in China&lt;/a&gt;‚Äîa secretive experiment that led to international outrage and prison time for the lead scientist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Dieter Egli, a gene-editing scientist at Columbia University whose team has briefed Armstrong, his plans may be motivated in part by recent improvements in editing technology that have opened up a safer, more precise way to change the DNA of embryos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That technique, called base editing, can deftly change a single DNA letter. Earlier methods, on the other hand, actually cut the double helix, damaging it and causing whole genes to disappear. ‚ÄúWe know much better now what to do,‚Äù says Egli. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean the work is all done, but it‚Äôs a very different game now‚Äîentirely different.‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoestring budget&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embryo editing, which ultimately aims to produce humans with genes tailored by design, is an idea that has been heavily stigmatized and starved of funding. While it&amp;#8217;s legal to study embryos in the lab, actually producing a gene-edited baby is flatly illegal in most countries.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, the modified baby ban operates via a law that forbids the Food and Drug Administration from considering, or even acknowledging, any application it gets to attempt a gene-edited baby. But that rule could be changed, especially if scientists can demonstrate a compelling use of the technique‚Äîor perhaps if a billionaire lobbies for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his post, Armstrong included an image of a seven-year-old Pew Research Center poll showing Americans were strongly favorable to altering a baby‚Äôs genes if it could treat disease, although the same poll found most opposed experimentation on embryos.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, no US company has openly pursued embryo editing, and the federal government doesn‚Äôt fund studies on embryos at all. Instead, research on gene editing in embryos has been carried forward in the US by just two academic centers, Egli‚Äôs and one at the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Those efforts have operated on a relative shoestring, held together by private grants and university funds. Researchers at those centers said they support the idea of a well-financed company that could advance the technology. ‚ÄúWe would honestly welcome that,‚Äù says Paula Amato, a fertility doctor at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University and the past president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.¬†&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúMore research is needed, and that takes people and money,‚Äù she says, adding that she doesn‚Äôt mind if it comes from ‚Äútech bros.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Editing embryos can, in theory, be used to correct genetic errors likely to cause serious childhood conditions. But since in most cases genetic testing of embryos can also be used to avoid those errors, many argue it will be hard to find a true unmet need where the DNA-altering technique is actually necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, it&amp;#8217;s easy to conclude that the bigger market for the technology would be to intervene in embryos in ways that &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/22/1096458/crispr-gene-editing-babies-evolution/"&gt;could make humans resistant to common conditions,&lt;/a&gt; such as heart disease or Alzheimer‚Äôs. But that is more controversial because it‚Äôs a type of enhancement, and the changes would also be passed through the generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only last week, several biotech trade and academic groups demanded &lt;a href="https://alliancerm.org/press-release/moratorium-on-hhge/"&gt;a 10-year moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on heritable human genome editing, saying the technology has few real medical uses and ‚Äúintroduces long-term risks with unknown consequences.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They said the ability to ‚Äúprogram‚Äù desired traits or eliminate bad ones risked a new form of ‚Äúeugenics,‚Äù one that would have the effect of ‚Äúpotentially altering the course of evolution.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No limits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Armstrong did not reply to an email from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; seeking comment about his plans. Nor did his company Coinbase, a cryptocurrency trading platform that went public in 2021 and is the source of his fortune, estimated at $10 billion by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The billionaire is already part of a wave of tech entrepreneurs who‚Äôve made a splash in science and biology by laying down outsize investments, sometimes in far-out ideas. Armstrong previously cofounded&lt;a href="http://newlimit.com/"&gt; NewLimit&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; calls a ‚Äú&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-06/brian-armstrong-s-human-life-extension-venture-raises-fresh-cash"&gt;life extension venture&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù and which this year raised a further $130 million to explore methods to&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/25/1061644/how-to-be-young-again/"&gt; reprogram old cells into an embryonic-like state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He started that company with Blake Byers, an investor who has said a significant portion of global GDP should be spent on ‚Äú&lt;a href="https://x.com/byersblake/status/1902048579612766428"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù research, including biotech approaches and ways of uploading human minds to computers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, starting late last year, Armstrong began publicly telegraphing his interest in exploring a new venture, this time connected to assisted reproduction. In December, he &lt;a href="https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1863334399774798099"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on X that he and Byers were ready to meet with entrepreneurs working on ‚Äúartificial wombs,‚Äù ‚Äúembryo editing,‚Äù and ‚Äúnext-gen IVF.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The post invited people to apply to attend an off-the-record dinner‚Äîa kind of forbidden-technologies soiree. Applicants had to fill in a Google form answering a few questions, including ‚ÄúWhat is something awesome you‚Äôve built?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Among those who attended the dinner was a postdoctoral fellow from Egli‚Äôs lab, &lt;a href="https://isscr2024.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?efp=SU1FRklKTEEyMDcxNw&amp;amp;PresenterID=1820095&amp;amp;rnd=0.7536881&amp;amp;mode=presenterinfo"&gt;Stepan Jerabek&lt;/a&gt;, who has been testing base-editing in embryos. Another attendee, Lucas Harrington, is a gene-editing scientist who trained at the University of California, Berkeley under&amp;nbsp;Jennifer Doudna, a winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry for development of CRISPR gene editing. Harrington says a venture group he helps run, called &lt;a href="https://www.scifounders.com/"&gt;SciFounders&lt;/a&gt;, is also considering starting an embryo-editing company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe share an interest in there being a company to empirically evaluate whether embryo editing can be done safely, and are actively exploring incubating a company to undertake this,‚Äù Harrington said in an email. ‚ÄúWe believe there need to be legitimate scientists and clinicians working to safely evaluate this technology.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of how rapidly gene editing is advancing, Harrington has also &lt;a href="https://lucas-harrington.com/2024/11/20/the-crispr-baby-ban-isnt-working-what-we-should-do-instead/"&gt;criticized bans&lt;/a&gt; and moratoria on the technology. These can‚Äôt stop it from being applied but, he says, can drive it into ‚Äúthe shadows,‚Äù where it might be used less safely. According to Harrington, ‚Äúseveral biohacker groups have quietly raised small amounts of capital‚Äù to pursue the technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Armstrong‚Äôs public declaration on X represents a more transparent approach. ‚ÄúIt seems pretty serious now. They want to put something together,‚Äù says Egli, who hopes the Coinbase CEO might fund some research at his lab. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs very good he posted publicly, because you can feel the temperature, see what reaction you get, and you stimulate the public conversation.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first reports that researchers were &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/03/05/249167/engineering-the-perfect-baby/"&gt;testing CRISPR on human embryos&lt;/a&gt; in the lab emerged from China in 2015, causing shock waves as it became clear how easy, in theory, it was to change human heredity. Two years later, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/07/26/68093/first-human-embryos-edited-in-us/"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, a report from Oregon claimed successful correction of a dangerous DNA mutation present in lab embryos made from patients‚Äô egg and sperm cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that breakthrough was not what it seemed. More careful testing by Egli and others showed that CRISPR technology actually can cause havoc in a cell, often deleting large chunks of chromosomes. That‚Äôs in addition to mosaicism, in which edits occur differently in different cells. What looked at first like precise DNA editing was in fact a dangerous process causing unseen damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the public debate turned on the ethics of CRISPR babies‚Äîespecially after three edited children were born in China‚Äîresearchers were discussing basic scientific problems and how to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then, both US labs, as well as some in China, have switched to base editing. That method causes fewer unexpected effects and, in theory, could also endow an embryo with a number of advantageous gene variants, not just one change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers also feel certain that editing an embryo is simpler than trying to treat sick adults. The only approved gene-editing treatment, for sickle-cell disease, costs more than $2 million. By contrast, editing an embryo could be incredibly cheap, and if it‚Äôs done early, when an embryo is forming, all the body cells could carry the change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou fix the text before you print the book,‚Äù says Egli. ‚ÄúIt seems like a no-brainer.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, gene editing isn‚Äôt quite ready for prime time in making babies. Getting there requires more work, including careful design of the editing system (which includes a protein and short guide molecule) and systematic ways to check embryos for unwanted DNA changes. That is the type of industrial effort Armstrong‚Äôs company, if he funds one, would be suited to carry out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou would have to optimize something to a point where it is perfect, to where it‚Äôs a breeze,‚Äù says Egli. ‚ÄúThis is the kind of work that companies do.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This is a summary. Full article available at source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, both US labs, as well as some in China, have switched to base editing. That method causes fewer unexpected effects and, in theory, could also endow an embryo with a number of advantageous gene variants, not just one change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers also feel certain that editing an embryo is simpler than trying to treat sick adults. The only approved gene-editing treatment, for sickle-cell disease, costs more than $2 million. By contrast, editing an embryo could be incredibly cheap, and if it‚Äôs done early, when an embryo is forming, all the body cells could carry the change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou fix the text before you print the book,‚Äù says Egli. ‚ÄúIt seems like a no-brainer.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, gene editing isn‚Äôt quite ready for prime time in making babies. Getting there requires more work, including careful design of the editing system (which includes a protein and short guide molecule) and systematic ways to check embryos for unwanted DNA changes. That is the type of industrial effort Armstrong‚Äôs company, if he funds one, would be suited to carry out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou would have to optimize something to a point where it is perfect, to where it‚Äôs a breeze,‚Äù says Egli. ‚ÄúThis is the kind of work that companies do.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/05/1117909/crypto-billionaire-brian-armstrong-is-ready-to-invest-in-crispr-baby-tech/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 09:36:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Over $1 billion in federal funding got slashed for this polluting industry (MIT Technology Review) [SUMMARY ONLY]</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/05/1117855/cement-funding-slash/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This is a summary.

&lt;p&gt;The clean cement industry might be facing the end of the road, before it ever really got rolling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the US Department of Energy &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-wright-announces-termination-24-projects-generating-over-3-billion-taxpayer?utm_campaign=Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=364035686&amp;amp;utm_content=364035686&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was canceling $3.7 billion in funding for 24 projects related to energy and industry. That included nearly $1.3 billion for cement-related projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cement is a massive climate problem, accounting for roughly 7% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs a difficult industry to clean up, with huge traditional players and expensive equipment and infrastructure to replace. This funding was supposed to help address those difficulties, by supporting projects on the cusp of commercialization. Now companies will need to fill in the gap left by these cancellations, and it‚Äôs a big one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First up on the list for cuts is Sublime Systems, a company you‚Äôre probably familiar with if you‚Äôve been reading this newsletter for a while. I did a &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/03/1084734/sublime-systems-cement-climate-change-carbon-footprint/?utm_source=the_spark&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_spark.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7Cdate:m-d-y%7C*" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;deep dive&lt;/a&gt; last year, and the company was on our list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in both &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080528/2023-climate-tech-companies-electric-vehicles-batteries-carbon-removal-energy-storage/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/01/1104432/2024-climate-tech-companies/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The startup‚Äôs approach is to make cement using electricity. The conventional process requires high temperatures typically achieved by burning fossil fuels, so avoiding that could prevent a lot of emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Sublime received an $87 million grant from the DOE to construct a commercial demonstration plant in Holyoke, Massachusetts. That grant would have covered roughly half the construction costs for the facility, which is scheduled to open in 2026 and produce up to 30,000 metric tons of cement each year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe were certainly surprised and disappointed about the development,‚Äù says Joe Hicken, Sublime‚Äôs senior VP of business development and policy. Customers are excited by the company‚Äôs technology, Hicken adds, pointing to Sublime‚Äôs &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/microsoft-just-signed-a-deal-for-green-cement-here-s-why?sref=E9Urfma4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced deal with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which plans to buy up to 622,500 metric tons of cement from the company.¬†&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another big name, Brimstone, also saw its funding affected. That award totaled $189 million for a commercial demonstration plant, which was expected to produce over 100,000 metric tons of cement annually.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a Brimstone representative said the company believes the cancellation was a ‚Äúmisunderstanding.‚Äù The statement pointed out that the planned facility would make not only cement but also alumina, supporting US-based aluminum production. (Aluminum is classified as a &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;critical mineral&lt;/a&gt; by the US Geological Survey, meaning it‚Äôs considered crucial to the US economy and national security.)¬†&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An award to Heidelberg Materials for up to $500 million for a planned Indiana facility was also axed. The idea there was to integrate carbon capture and storage to clean up emissions from the plant, which would have made it the first cement plant in the US to demonstrate that technology. In a written statement, a representative said the decision can be appealed, and the company is considering that option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And National Cement‚Äôs funding for the Lebec Net-Zero Project, another $500 million award, was canceled. That facility planned to make carbon-neutral cement through a combination of strategies: reducing the polluting ingredients needed, using alternative fuels like biomass, and capturing the plant‚Äôs remaining emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe want to emphasize that this project will expand domestic manufacturing capacity for a critical industrial sector, while also integrating new technologies to keep American cement competitive,‚Äù said a company spokesperson in a written statement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a sentiment here that‚Äôs echoed in all the responses I received: While these awards were designed to cut emissions, these companies argue that they can fit into the new administration‚Äôs priorities. They‚Äôre emphasizing phrases like ‚Äúcritical minerals,‚Äù ‚ÄúAmerican jobs,‚Äù and ‚Äúdomestic supply chains.‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôve heard loud and clear from the Trump administration the desire to displace foreign imports of things that can be made here in America,‚Äù Sublime‚Äôs Hicken says. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, what we deliver is what the policymakers in DC are looking for.‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But this administration is showing that it‚Äôs not supporting climate efforts‚Äîoften even those that also advance its stated goals of energy abundance and American competitiveness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday, my colleague James Temple published &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/02/1117653/the-trump-administration-has-shut-down-more-than-100-climate-studies/?utm_source=the_spark&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_spark.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7Cdate:m-d-y%7C*" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new story&lt;/a&gt; about cuts to climate research, including tens of millions of dollars in grants from the National Science Foundation. Researchers at Harvard were particularly hard hit.¬†&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even as there‚Äôs interest in advancing the position of the US on the world‚Äôs stage, these cuts are making it hard for researchers and companies alike to do the crucial work of understanding our climate and developing and deploying new technologies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Armstrong, the billionaire CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, says he‚Äôs ready to fund a US startup focused on gene-editing human embryos. If he goes forward, it would be the first major commercial investment in one of medicine‚Äôs most fraught ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a post on X June 2, Armstrong announced he was looking for gene-editing scientists and bioinformatics specialists to form a founding team for an ‚Äúembryo editing‚Äù effort targeting an unmet medical need, such as a genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crypto billionaire Brian Armstrong is ready to invest in CRISPR baby tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian Armstrong, the billionaire CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, says he‚Äôs ready to fund a US startup focused on gene-editing human embryos. If he goes forward, it would be the first major commercial investment in one of medicine‚Äôs most fraught ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a post on X June 2, Armstrong announced he was looking for gene-editing scientists and bioinformatics specialists to form a founding team for an ‚Äúembryo editing‚Äù effort targeting an unmet medical need, such as a genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The announcement from a deep-pocketed backer is a striking shift for a field considered taboo following the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/25/138962/exclusive-chinese-scientists-are-creating-crispr-babies/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;2018 birth of the world‚Äôs first genetically edited children in China&lt;/a&gt;‚Äîa secretive experiment that led to international outrage and prison time for the lead scientist. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/05/1117909/crypto-billionaire-brian-armstrong-is-ready-to-invest-in-crispr-baby-tech/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over $1 billion in federal funding got slashed for this polluting industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clean cement industry might be facing the end of the road, before it ever really got rolling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, the US Department of Energy announced that it was canceling $3.7 billion in funding for 24 projects related to energy and industry. That included nearly $1.3 billion for cement-related projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cement is a massive climate problem, accounting for roughly 7% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs a difficult industry to clean up, with huge traditional players and expensive equipment and infrastructure to replace. This funding was supposed to help address those difficulties, by supporting projects on the cusp of commercialization. Now companies will need to fill in the gap left by these cancellations, and it‚Äôs a big one. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/05/1117855/cement-funding-slash/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-large-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúAnthropic bills itself as the white knight of the AI industry. It is anything but.‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄîReddit takes aim at Anthropic in a legal filing against the AI company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/679768/reddit-sues-anthropic-alleging-its-bots-accessed-reddit-more-than-100000-times-since-last-july"&gt;the Verge&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe you will be able to live past 122&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long can humans live? This is a good time to ask the question. The longevity scene is having a moment, and research suggests that we might be able to push human life spans further, potentially even reversing some signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Researchers can‚Äôt even agree on what the exact mechanisms of aging are and which they should be targeting. Debates continue to rage over how long it‚Äôs possible for humans to live‚Äîand whether there is a limit at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it looks likely that something will be developed in the coming decades that will help us live longer, in better health. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/26/1096126/aging-health-longevity-lifespan-advances-investment/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Full article available at source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit is accusing Anthropic of building its Claude AI models on the back of Reddit&amp;#8217;s users, without permission and without paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyone who uses Reddit, even a web-crawling bot, agrees to the site&amp;#8217;s user agreement. That agreement is clear: you cannot just take content from the site and use it for your own commercial products without a written deal. Reddit claims Anthropic&amp;#8217;s bots have been doing exactly that for years, scraping massive amounts of conversations and posts to train and improve Claude.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes this lawsuit particularly spicy is the way it goes after Anthropic&amp;#8217;s reputation. Anthropic has worked hard to brand itself as the ethical, trustworthy AI company, the &amp;#8220;white knight&amp;#8221; of the industry. The lawsuit, however, calls these claims nothing more than &amp;#8220;empty marketing gimmicks&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, Reddit points to a statement from July 2024 where Anthropic claimed it had stopped its bots from crawling Reddit. The lawsuit says this was &amp;#8220;false&amp;#8221;, alleging that its logs caught Anthropic&amp;#8217;s bots trying to access the site more than one hundred thousand times in the following months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this isn&amp;#8217;t just about corporate squabbles; it directly involves user privacy. When you delete a post or a comment on Reddit, you expect it to be gone. Reddit has official licensing deals with other big AI players like Google &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-secures-key-partnership-with-reddit/"&gt;and OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;, and these deals include technical measures to ensure that when a user deletes content, the AI company does too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Reddit&amp;#8217;s lawsuit, Anthropic has no such deal and has refused to enter one. This means if their AI was trained on a post you later deleted, that content could still be baked into Claude&amp;#8217;s knowledge base, effectively ignoring your choice to remove it. The lawsuit even includes a screenshot where Claude itself admits it has no real way of knowing if the Reddit data it was trained on was later deleted by a user:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot from a court filing in the lawsuit of Anthropic Claude admitting it does not know if scraped Reddit data was later deleted." class="wp-image-106716" height="858" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/anthropic-reddit-data-claude-ai-deleted-data-artificial-intelligence-1024x858.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what does Reddit want? It&amp;#8217;s not just about money, although they are asking for damages for things like increased server costs and lost licensing fees. They are asking the court for an injunction to force Anthropic to stop using any Reddit data immediately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Reddit wants to prohibit Anthropic from selling or licensing any product that was built using that data. That means they&amp;#8217;re asking a judge to effectively take Claude off the market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This case forces a tough question: Does being &amp;#8220;publicly available&amp;#8221; on the internet mean content is free for any corporation &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/tony-blair-institute-ai-copyright-report-sparks-backlash/"&gt;to take and monetise?&lt;/a&gt; Reddit is arguing a firm &amp;#8220;no,&amp;#8221; and the outcome could change the rules for how AI is developed from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;

Full article available at source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, China saw a boom in foundation models, the do-everything large language models that underpin the AI revolution. This year, the focus has shifted to AI agents‚Äîsystems that are less about responding to users‚Äô queries and more about autonomously accomplishing things for them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are now a host of Chinese startups building these general-purpose digital tools, which can answer emails, browse the internet to plan vacations, and even design an interactive website. Many of these have emerged in just the last two months, following in the footsteps of Manus‚Äîa general AI agent that sparked weeks of social media frenzy for invite codes after its &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/1113133/manus-ai-review/"&gt;limited-release launch in early March&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These emerging AI agents aren‚Äôt large language models themselves. Instead, they‚Äôre built on top of them, using a workflow-based structure designed to get things done. A lot of these systems also introduce a different way of interacting with AI. Rather than just chatting back and forth with users, they are optimized for managing and executing multistep tasks‚Äîbooking flights, managing schedules, conducting research‚Äîby using external tools and remembering instructions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China could take the lead on building these kinds of agents. The country‚Äôs tightly integrated app ecosystems, rapid product cycles, and digitally fluent user base could provide a favorable environment for embedding AI into daily life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, its leading AI agent startups are focusing their attention on the global market, because the best Western models don‚Äôt operate inside China‚Äôs firewalls. But that could change soon: Tech giants like ByteDance and Tencent are preparing their own AI agents that could bake automation directly into their native super-apps, pulling data from their vast ecosystem of programs that dominate many aspects of daily life in the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the race to define what a useful AI agent looks like unfolds, a mix of ambitious startups and entrenched tech giants are now testing how these tools might actually work in practice‚Äîand for whom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set the standard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a whirlwind few months for Manus, which was developed by the startup Butterfly Effect. The company raised $75 million in a funding round led by the US venture capital firm Benchmark, took the product on an ambitious global roadshow, and hired dozens of new employees.¬†&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even before registration opened to the public in May, Manus had become a reference point for what a broad, consumer‚Äëoriented AI agent should accomplish. Rather than handling narrow chores for businesses, this ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù agent is designed to be able to help with everyday tasks like trip planning, stock comparison, or your kid‚Äôs school project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous AI agents, Manus uses a browser-based sandbox that lets users supervise the agent like an intern, watching in real time as it scrolls through web pages, reads articles, or codes actions. It also proactively asks clarifying questions, supports long-term memory that would serve as context for future tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Manus represents a promising product experience for AI agents,&amp;#8221; says Ang Li, cofounder and CEO of Simular, a startup based in Palo Alto, California, that‚Äôs building AI agents that operate a real computer. ‚ÄúI believe Chinese startups have a huge advantage when it comes to designing consumer products, thanks to cutthroat domestic competition that leads to fast execution and greater attention to product details.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of Manus, the competition is moving fast. Two of the most buzzy follow‚Äëups, Genspark and Flowith, for example, are already boasting benchmark scores that match or edge past Manus‚Äôs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.genspark.ai/"&gt;Genspark&lt;/a&gt;, led by former Baidu executives Eric‚ÄØJing and Kay‚ÄØZhu, links many small ‚Äúsuper agents‚Äù through what it calls multi‚Äëcomponent prompting. The agent can switch among several large language models, accepts both images and text, and carries out tasks from making slide decks to placing phone calls. Whereas Manus relies heavily on Browser Use, a popular open-source product that lets agents operate a web browser in a virtual window like a human, Genspark directly integrates with a wide array of tools and APIs. Launched in April, the company says that it already has over 5 million users and over $36 million in yearly revenue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://flowith.io"&gt;Flowith&lt;/a&gt;, the work of a young team that first grabbed public attention in April 2025 at a developer event hosted by the popular social media app Xiaohongshu, takes a different tack. Marketed as an ‚Äúinfinite agent,‚Äù it opens on a blank canvas where each question becomes a node on a branching map. Users can backtrack, take new branches, and store results in personal or sharable ‚Äúknowledge gardens‚Äù‚Äîa design that feels more like project management software (think Notion) than a typical chat interface. Every inquiry or task builds its own mind-map-like graph, encouraging a more nonlinear and creative interaction with AI. Flowith‚Äôs core agent, NEO, runs in the cloud and can perform scheduled tasks like sending emails and compiling files. The founders want the app to be a ‚Äúknowledge marketbase‚Äù, and aims to tap into the social aspect of AI with the aspiration of becoming ‚Äúthe OnlyFans of AI knowledge creators‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What they also share with Manus is the global ambition. Both Genspark and Flowith have stated that their primary focus is the international market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A global address&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Startups like Manus, Genspark, and Flowith‚Äîthough founded by Chinese entrepreneurs‚Äîcould blend seamlessly into the global tech scene and compete effectively abroad. Founders, investors, and analysts that &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has spoken to believe Chinese companies are moving fast, executing well, and quickly coming up with new products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Money reinforces the pull to launch overseas. Customers there pay more, and there are plenty to go around. ‚ÄúYou can price in USD, and with the exchange rate that‚Äôs a sevenfold multiplier,‚Äù Manus cofounder‚ÄØXiao‚ÄØHong quipped on a podcast. ‚ÄúEven if we‚Äôre only operating at 10% power because of cultural differences overseas, we‚Äôll still make more than in China.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But creating the same functionality in China is a challenge. Major US AI companies including OpenAI and Anthropic have opted out of mainland China because of geopolitical risks and challenges with regulatory compliance. Their absence initially created a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chinas-chatgpt-black-market-baidu/"&gt;black market&lt;/a&gt; as users resorted to VPNs and third-party mirrors to access tools like ChatGPT and Claude. That vacuum has since been filled by a new wave of Chinese chatbots‚ÄîDeepSeek, Doubao, Kimi‚Äîbut the appetite for foreign models hasn‚Äôt gone away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manus, for example, uses Anthropic‚Äôs Claude‚ÄØSonnet‚Äîwidely considered the top model for agentic tasks. Manus cofounder‚ÄØZhang‚ÄØTao has repeatedly praised Claude‚Äôs ability to juggle tools, remember contexts, and hold multi‚Äëround conversations‚Äîall crucial for turning chatty software into an effective executive assistant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the company‚Äôs use of Sonnet has made its agent functionally unusable inside China without a VPN. If you open Manus from a mainland IP address, you‚Äôll see a notice explaining that the team is ‚Äúworking on integrating Qwen‚Äôs model,‚Äù a special local version that is built on top of Alibaba‚Äôs open-source model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An engineer overseeing ByteDance‚Äôs work on developing an agent, who spoke to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;anonymously to avoid sanction, said that the absence of Claude‚ÄØSonnet models ‚Äúlimits everything we do in China.‚Äù DeepSeek‚Äôs open models, he added, still hallucinate too often and lack training on real‚Äëworld workflows. Developers we spoke with rank Alibaba‚Äôs Qwen series as the best domestic alternative, yet most say that switching to Qwen knocks performance down a notch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jiaxin‚ÄØPei, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford‚Äôs Institute for Human‚ÄëCentered AI, thinks that gap will close: ‚ÄúBuilding agentic capabilities in base LLMs has become a key focus for many LLM builders, and once people realize the value of this, it will only be a matter of time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, Manus is doubling down on audiences it can already serve. In a written response, the company said its ‚Äúprimary focus is overseas expansion,‚Äù noting that new offices in San Francisco, Singapore, and Tokyo have opened in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A super‚Äëapp approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the concept of AI agents is still relatively new, the consumer-facing AI app market in China is already crowded with major tech players. DeepSeek remains the most widely used, while ByteDance‚Äôs Doubao and Moonshot‚Äôs Kimi have also become household names. However, most of these apps are still optimized for chat and entertainment rather than task execution. This gap in the local market has pushed China‚Äôs big tech firms to roll out their own user-facing agents, though early versions remain uneven in quality and rough around the edges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ByteDance is testing Coze‚ÄØSpace, an AI agent based on its own Doubao model family that lets users toggle between ‚Äúplan‚Äù and ‚Äúexecute‚Äù modes, so they can either directly guide the agent‚Äôs actions or step back and watch it work autonomously. It connects up to 14 popular apps, including GitHub, Notion, and the company‚Äôs own Lark office suite. Early reviews &lt;a href="https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20250419A04HM900"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; the tool can feel clunky and has a high failure rate, but it clearly aims to match what Manus offers.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Zhipu‚ÄØAI has released a free agent called AutoGLM‚ÄØRumination, built on its proprietary ChatGLM models. Shanghai‚Äëbased Minimax has launched Minimax‚ÄØAgent. Both products look almost identical to Manus and demo basic tasks such as building a simple website, planning a trip, making a small Flash game, or running quick data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the limited usability of most general AI agents launched within China, big companies have plans to change that. During a May‚ÄØ15 earnings call, Tencent president Liu‚ÄØZhiping teased an agent that would weave automation directly into China‚Äôs most ubiquitous app, WeChat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Considered the original super-app, WeChat already handles messaging, mobile payments, news, and millions of mini‚Äëprograms that act like embedded apps. These programs give Tencent, its developer, access to data from millions of services that pervade everyday life in China, an advantage most competitors can only envy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Historically, China‚Äôs consumer internet has splintered into competing walled gardens‚Äîshare a Taobao link in WeChat and it resolves as plaintext, not a preview card. Unlike the more interoperable Western internet, China‚Äôs tech giants have long resisted integration with one another, choosing to wage platform war at the expense of a seamless user experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the use of mini‚Äëprograms has given WeChat unprecedented reach across services that once resisted interoperability, from gym bookings to grocery orders. An agent able to roam that ecosystem could bypass the integration headaches dogging independent startups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alibaba, the e-commerce giant behind the Qwen model series, has been a front-runner in China&amp;#8217;s AI race but has been slower to release consumer-facing products. Even though Qwen was the most downloaded open-source model on Hugging Face in 2024, it didn‚Äôt power a dedicated chatbot app until early 2025. In March, Alibaba rebranded its cloud storage and search app Quark into an all-in-one AI search tool. By June, Quark had introduced DeepResearch‚Äîa new mode that marks its most agent-like effort to date.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ByteDance and Alibaba did not reply to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;‚Äôs request for comments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHistorically, Chinese tech products tend to pursue the all-in-one, super-app approach, and the latest Chinese AI agents reflect just that,‚Äù says Li of Simular, who previously worked at Google DeepMind on lifelong learning agents. ‚ÄúIn contrast, AI agents in the US are more focused on serving specific verticals.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pei, the researcher at Stanford, says that existing tech giants could have a huge advantage in bringing the vision of general AI agents to life‚Äîespecially those with built-in integration across services. ‚ÄúThe customer-facing AI agent market is still very early, with tons of problems like authentication and liability,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut companies that already operate across a wide range of services have a natural advantage in deploying agents at scale.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the concept of AI agents is still relatively new, the consumer-facing AI app market in China is already crowded with major tech players. DeepSeek remains the most widely used, while ByteDance‚Äôs Doubao and Moonshot‚Äôs Kimi have also become household names. However, most of these apps are still optimized for chat and entertainment rather than task execution. This gap in the local market has pushed China‚Äôs big tech firms to roll out their own user-facing agents, though early versions remain uneven in quality and rough around the edges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ByteDance is testing Coze‚ÄØSpace, an AI agent based on its own Doubao model family that lets users toggle between ‚Äúplan‚Äù and ‚Äúexecute‚Äù modes, so they can either directly guide the agent‚Äôs actions or step back and watch it work autonomously. It connects up to 14 popular apps, including GitHub, Notion, and the company‚Äôs own Lark office suite. Early reviews &lt;a href="https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20250419A04HM900"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; the tool can feel clunky and has a high failure rate, but it clearly aims to match what Manus offers.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Zhipu‚ÄØAI has released a free agent called AutoGLM‚ÄØRumination, built on its proprietary ChatGLM models. Shanghai‚Äëbased Minimax has launched Minimax‚ÄØAgent. Both products look almost identical to Manus and demo basic tasks such as building a simple website, planning a trip, making a small Flash game, or running quick data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the limited usability of most general AI agents launched within China, big companies have plans to change that. During a May‚ÄØ15 earnings call, Tencent president Liu‚ÄØZhiping teased an agent that would weave automation directly into China‚Äôs most ubiquitous app, WeChat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Considered the original super-app, WeChat already handles messaging, mobile payments, news, and millions of mini‚Äëprograms that act like embedded apps. These programs give Tencent, its developer, access to data from millions of services that pervade everyday life in China, an advantage most competitors can only envy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Historically, China‚Äôs consumer internet has splintered into competing walled gardens‚Äîshare a Taobao link in WeChat and it resolves as plaintext, not a preview card. Unlike the more interoperable Western internet, China‚Äôs tech giants have long resisted integration with one another, choosing to wage platform war at the expense of a seamless user experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the use of mini‚Äëprograms has given WeChat unprecedented reach across services that once resisted interoperability, from gym bookings to grocery orders. An agent able to roam that ecosystem could bypass the integration headaches dogging independent startups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alibaba, the e-commerce giant behind the Qwen model series, has been a front-runner in China&amp;#8217;s AI race but has been slower to release consumer-facing products. Even though Qwen was the most downloaded open-source model on Hugging Face in 2024, it didn‚Äôt power a dedicated chatbot app until early 2025. In March, Alibaba rebranded its cloud storage and search app Quark into an all-in-one AI search tool. By June, Quark had introduced DeepResearch‚Äîa new mode that marks its most agent-like effort to date.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ByteDance and Alibaba did not reply to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;‚Äôs request for comments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHistorically, Chinese tech products tend to pursue the all-in-one, super-app approach, and the latest Chinese AI agents reflect just that,‚Äù says Li of Simular, who previously worked at Google DeepMind on lifelong learning agents. ‚ÄúIn contrast, AI agents in the US are more focused on serving specific verticals.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pei, the researcher at Stanford, says that existing tech giants could have a huge advantage in bringing the vision of general AI agents to life‚Äîespecially those with built-in integration across services. ‚ÄúThe customer-facing AI agent market is still very early, with tons of problems like authentication and liability,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut companies that already operate across a wide range of services have a natural advantage in deploying agents at scale.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later this month, an inconspicuous 150-kilogram satellite is set to launch into space aboard the SpaceX Transporter 14 mission. Once in orbit, it will test super-accurate next-generation satnav technology designed to make up for the shortcomings of the US Global Positioning System (GPS).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The satellite is the first of a planned constellation called Pulsar, which is being developed by California-based Xona Space Systems. The company ultimately plans to have a constellation of 258 satellites in low Earth orbit. Although these satellites will operate much like those used to create GPS, they will orbit about 12,000 miles closer to Earth‚Äôs surface, beaming down a much stronger signal that‚Äôs more accurate‚Äîand harder to jam.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúJust because of this shorter distance, we will put down signals that will be approximately a hundred times stronger than the GPS signal,‚Äù says Tyler Reid, chief technology officer and cofounder of Xona. ‚ÄúThat means the reach of jammers will be much smaller against our system, but we will also be able to reach deeper into indoor locations, penetrating through multiple walls.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A satnav system for the 21st century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first GPS system went live in 1993. In the decades since, it has become one of the foundational technologies that the world depends on. The precise positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) signals beamed by its&amp;nbsp; satellites underpin much more than Google Maps in your phone. They guide drill heads at offshore oil rigs, time-stamp financial transactions, and help sync power grids all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But despite the system‚Äôs indispensable nature, the GPS signal is easily suppressed or disrupted by everything from space weather to 5G cell towers to phone-size jammers worth a few tens of dollars. The problem has been &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/11/15/131940/ghost-ships-crop-circles-and-soft-gold-a-gps-mystery-in-shanghai/"&gt;whispered about among experts for years&lt;/a&gt;, but it has really come to the fore in the last three years, since Russia invaded Ukraine. The boom in drone warfare that came to characterize that war also triggered a race to develop technology for thwarting drone attacks by jamming the GPS signals they need to navigate‚Äîor spoofing the signal, creating convincing but fake positioning data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The crucial problem is one of distance: The GPS constellation, which consists of 24 satellites plus a handful of spares, orbits 12,550 miles (20,200 kilometers) above Earth, in a region known as medium Earth orbit. By the time their signals get all the way down to ground-based receivers, they are so faint that they can easily be overridden by jammers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other existing Global Navigation Satellite System constellations, such as Europe‚Äôs Galileo, Russia‚Äôs GLONASS, and China‚Äôs Beidou, have similar architectures and experience the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when Reid and cofounder Brian Manning founded Xona Space Systems in 2019, they didn‚Äôt think about jamming and spoofing. Their goal was to make autonomous driving ready for prime time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="assembled GPS unit on a wheeled stand in a clean room" class="wp-image-1117858" height="1366" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Aerospacelab_IOV-ReadyToLaunch_1.jpeg?w=1366" width="1366" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Xona Space System‚Äôs completed Pulsar-0 satellite is launching this June.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AEROSPACELAB&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dozens of robocars from Uber and Waymo were already cruising American freeways at that time, equipped with expensive suites of sensors like high-resolution cameras and lidar. The engineers figured a more precise satellite navigation system could reduce the need for those sensors, making it possible to create a safe autonomous vehicle affordable enough to go mainstream. One day, cars might even be able to share their positioning data with one another, Reid says. But they knew that GPS was nowhere near accurate enough to keep self-driving cars within the lane lines and away from other objects on the road. That is especially true in densely built-up urban environments that provide many chances for signals to bounce off walls, creating errors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúGPS has the superpower of being a ubiquitous system that works the same anywhere in the world,‚Äù Reid says. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a system that was designed primarily to support military missions, virtually to enable them to drop five bombs in the same bowl. But this meter-level accuracy is not enough to guide machines where they need to go and share that physical space with humans safely.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Reid and Manning began to think about how to build a space-based PNT system that would do what GPS does but better, with accuracy of three inches (10 centimeters) or less and ironclad reliability in all sorts of challenging conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to do that is to bring the satellites closer to Earth so that data reaches receivers in real time without inaccuracy-causing delays. The stronger signal of satellites in low Earth orbit is more resistant to disruptions of all sorts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When GPS was conceived, none of that was possible. Constellations in low Earth orbit‚Äîaltitudes up to 1,200 miles (2,000 km)‚Äîrequire hundreds of satellites to provide constant coverage over the entire globe. For a long time, space technology was too bulky and expensive to make such large constellations viable. Over the past decade, however, smaller electronics and lower launch costs have changed the equation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn 2019, when we started, the ecosystem of low Earth orbit was really exploding,‚Äù Reid says. ‚ÄúWe could see things like Starlink, OneWeb, and other constellations take off.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matter of urgency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the few years since Xona launched, concerns about GPS‚Äôs vulnerability have begun to grow amid rising geopolitical tensions. As a result, finding a reliable replacement has become a matter of strategic importance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine especially, GPS jamming and spoofing have become so common that prized US precision munitions such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System became effectively blind. Makers of first-person-view drones, which came to symbolize the war, had to refocus on AI-driven autonomous navigation to keep those drones in the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The problem quickly spilled beyond Ukraine. Countries bordering Russia, such as Finland and Estonia, complained that the increasing prevalence of GPS jamming and spoofing was affecting commercial flights and ships in the region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Cl√©mence Poirier, a space security researcher at ETH Zurich, says that the problem of GPS disruption isn‚Äôt limited to the vicinity of war zones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBasic jammers are very cheap and super easily accessible to everyone online,‚Äù Poirier says. ‚ÄúEven with the simplest ones, which can be the size of your phone, you can disrupt GPS signals in [an] area of a hundred or more meters.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2013, a truck driver using such a device to conceal his location from his boss accidently disrupted GPS signals around the Newark airport in New Jersey. In 2022, the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport reported a 24-hour GPS outage, which prompted a temporary closure of one of its runways. The source of the interference was never identified. That same year, Denver International Airport experienced a 33-hour GPS disruption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race to securing PNT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúXona is a promising solution to enhance the resilience of GPS-dependent critical infrastructures and mitigate the threat of GPS jamming and spoofing,‚Äù Poirier says. But, she adds, there is no ‚Äúmagic wand,‚Äù and a ‚Äúvariety of different approaches will be needed‚Äù to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;And indeed, Xona is not the only company hoping to provide a backup for the indispensable yet increasingly vulnerable GPS. Companies such as Anello Photonics, based in Santa Clara, California, and Sydney-based Advanced Navigation are testing terrestrial solutions: inertial navigation devices that are small and affordable enough for use beyond high-end military tech. These systems rely on gyroscopes and accelerometers to deduce a vehicle‚Äôs position from its own motions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When integrated into PNT receivers, these technologies can help detect GPS spoofing and take over for the duration of the interference. Inertial navigation has been around for decades, but recent advances in photonic technologies and microelectromechanical systems have brought it into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The French aerospace and defense conglomerate Safran is developing a system that distributes PNT data via&amp;nbsp; optical-fiber networks, which form the backbone of the global internet infrastructure. But the allure of space remains strong: The ability to reach any place at any time is what turned GPS from an obscure military system into a piece of taken-for-granted infrastructure that most people today can hardly live without.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Xona could have some space-based competition. Virginia-based TrustPoint is currently raising funds to build its own low-Earth-orbit PNT constellation, and some have proposed that signals from SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink could be repurposed to provide PNT services as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xona hopes to secure its spot in the market by designing its signal to be compatible with that of GPS, allowing manufacturers of GPS receivers to easily slot the new constellation into existing tech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it will take at least until 2030 for the entire constellation to be up and running, Reid says Xona‚Äôs system will provide a valuable addition to the existing GPS infrastructure as soon as 16 of its satellites are in orbit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The upcoming launch comes three years after a demonstration mission known as Huginn tested the basics of the technology. The new satellite, called Pulsar-0, will be used to see how well the system can resist jamming or spoofing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xona plans to launch an additional four spacecraft next year and hopes to have most of the constellation deployed by 2030.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

These systems rely on gyroscopes and accelerometers to deduce a vehicle‚Äôs position from its own motions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When integrated into PNT receivers, these technologies can help detect GPS spoofing and take over for the duration of the interference. Inertial navigation has been around for decades, but recent advances in photonic technologies and microelectromechanical systems have brought it into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The French aerospace and defense conglomerate Safran is developing a system that distributes PNT data via&amp;nbsp; optical-fiber networks, which form the backbone of the global internet infrastructure. But the allure of space remains strong: The ability to reach any place at any time is what turned GPS from an obscure military system into a piece of taken-for-granted infrastructure that most people today can hardly live without.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Xona could have some space-based competition. Virginia-based TrustPoint is currently raising funds to build its own low-Earth-orbit PNT constellation, and some have proposed that signals from SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink could be repurposed to provide PNT services as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xona hopes to secure its spot in the market by designing its signal to be compatible with that of GPS, allowing manufacturers of GPS receivers to easily slot the new constellation into existing tech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it will take at least until 2030 for the entire constellation to be up and running, Reid says Xona‚Äôs system will provide a valuable addition to the existing GPS infrastructure as soon as 16 of its satellites are in orbit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The upcoming launch comes three years after a demonstration mission known as Huginn tested the basics of the technology. The new satellite, called Pulsar-0, will be used to see how well the system can resist jamming or spoofing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xona plans to launch an additional four spacecraft next year and hopes to have most of the constellation deployed by 2030.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Full article available at source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I‚Äôve been thinking about the powerful connection between mind and body. Some &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgle5w54j6po"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that people with heart conditions have better outcomes when they are more hopeful and optimistic. Hopelessness, on the other hand, is associated with a significantly higher risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings build upon decades of fascinating research into the phenomenon of the placebo effect. Our beliefs and expectations about a medicine (or a sham treatment) can change the way it works. The placebo effect‚Äôs ‚Äúevil twin,‚Äù the nocebo effect, is just as powerful‚Äînegative thinking has been linked to real symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still trying to understand the connection between body and mind, and how our thoughts can influence our physiology. In the meantime, many are developing ways to harness it in hospital settings. Is it possible for a doctor to prescribe hope?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alexander Montasem, a lecturer in psychology at the University of Liverpool, is trying to find an answer to that question. In his latest study, Montasem and his colleagues focused on people with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The team reviewed all published research into the link between hope and heart health outcomes in such individuals.&lt;/strong&gt; Hope is a pretty tricky thing to nail down, but these studies use questionnaires to try to do that. In¬†&lt;a href="https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/resources/questionnaires-researchers/adult-hope-scale"&gt;one popular questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;, hope is defined as ‚Äúa positive motivational state‚Äù based on having agency and plans to meet personal goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Montasem‚Äôs team found 12 studies that fit the bill. All told, these studies included over 5,000 people. And together, they found that high hopefulness was associated with better health outcomes: less angina, less post-stroke fatigue, a higher quality of life, and a lower risk of death. The team presented its work at¬†&lt;a href="https://britishcardiovascularsociety.org.uk/platform_event/bcs-annual-conference-2025/"&gt;the British Cardiovascular Society meeting&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I read the results, it immediately got me thinking about the placebo effect. &lt;/strong&gt;A placebo is a ‚Äúsham‚Äù treatment‚Äîan inert substance like a sugar pill or saline injection that does not contain any medicine. And yet hundreds of studies have shown that such treatments can have remarkable effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They can ease the symptoms of pain, migraine, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, depression, anxiety, and a host of other disorders. The way a placebo is delivered can influence its effectiveness, and so can its color, shape, and price.¬†&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9879252/"&gt;Expensive placebos seem to be more effective&lt;/a&gt;. And placebos¬†&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015591"&gt;can even work when people know they are just placebos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then there‚Äôs the nocebo effect. &lt;/strong&gt;If you expect to feel worse after taking something, you are much more likely to. The nocebo effect can¬†&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11252084/"&gt;increase the risk of pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, flu-like symptoms, and more&lt;/a&gt;.¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs obvious our thoughts and beliefs can play an enormous role in our health and well-being. What‚Äôs less clear is exactly how it happens. Scientists have made some progress‚Äîthere‚Äôs evidence that¬†&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-45493-6_10"&gt;a range of brain chemicals, including the body‚Äôs own opioids, are involved&lt;/a&gt; in both the placebo and nocebo effects. But the exact mechanisms remain something of a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the meantime, researchers are working on ways to harness the power of positive thinking. &lt;/strong&gt;There have been long-running debates over¬†&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/placebo-or-sham-surgery-is-not-a-cruel-trick-it-can-be-very-effective-229896"&gt;whether it is ever ethical for a doctor to deceive patients to make them feel better&lt;/a&gt;. But I‚Äôm firmly of the belief that doctors have a duty to be honest with their patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A more ethical approach might be to find ways to build patients‚Äô hope, says Montasem. Not by exaggerating the likely benefit of a drug or by sugar-coating a prognosis, but perhaps by helping them work on their goals, agency, and general outlook on life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some early research suggests that this approach can help. Laurie McLouth at the University of Kentucky and her colleagues found that a series of discussions about values, goals, and strategies to achieve those goals¬†&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pon.6316"&gt;improved hope among people being treated for advanced lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Montasem now plans to review all the published work in this area and design a new approach to increasing hope. Any approach might have to be tailored to an individual, he adds. Some people might be more responsive to a more spiritual or religious way of thinking about their lives, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These approaches could also be helpful for all of us, even outside clinical settings.&lt;/strong&gt; I asked Montasem if he had any advice for people who want to have a positive outlook on life more generally. He told me that it‚Äôs important to have personal goals, along with a plan to achieve them. His own goals center on advancing his research, helping patients, and spending time with his family. ‚ÄúMaterialistic goals aren‚Äôt as beneficial for your wellbeing,‚Äù he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since we spoke, I‚Äôve been thinking over my own goals. I‚Äôve realized that my first is to come up with a list of goals. And I plan to do it soon. ‚ÄúThe minute we give up [on pursuing] our goals, we start falling into hopelessness,‚Äù he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unveiling-the-future-of-data-and-ai"&gt;Unveiling the future of data and AI&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The summit&amp;#8217;s agenda will look at important topics shaping the future of data and AI, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating open data in Saudi Arabia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI fusion and machine learning innovations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data virtualisation and the power of data mesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical data governance and cybersecurity analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unified data cloud architectures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Discussions will be led by thought leaders from the Kingdom&amp;#8217;s top organisations, including Ministry of Hajj &amp;amp; Umrah, Insurance Authority, Council of Health Insurance, NEOM, AlNASSR Club Company | PIF, and Abdul Latif Jameel United Finance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dama-saudi-arabia-joins-as-supporting-partner"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAMA Saudi Arabia joins as supporting partner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Data Management Association (DAMA Saudi Arabia), the Kingdom&amp;#8217;s largest data management community, has joined the summit as a supporting partner. The partnership underscores DAMA&amp;#8217;s commitment to fostering a robust data management ecosystem and aligns with the summit&amp;#8217;s mission to elevate Saudi Arabia&amp;#8217;s position as a global leader in data and AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abdulaziz Almanea, Founder &amp;amp; Chairman of the Board, DAMA Saudi, spoke of the importance of the summit: &amp;#8220;Artificial intelligence is only as good as the data behind it. Quality, governance, and ethics must come first to ensure trust, accuracy, and impact. As Saudi Arabia accelerates its data-driven transformation, industry events like the Smart Data &amp;amp; AI Summit serve as vital platforms for bringing experts together to shape the future of AI with responsible and innovative data practices.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-legacy-of-excellence"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A legacy of excellence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The inaugural edition of the summit set a high benchmark, with attendees praising the quality of speakers, depth of discussions, and opportunities for networking and collaboration. Nayef Al-Otaibi, VP &amp;amp; Chief Digital Officer at Saudi Aramco, said, &amp;#8220;The event was well-managed, the coordination was excellent, and the quality of the speakers was above expectations. It was a beautiful experience connecting with industry experts during the panel discussions and sharing our experiences. This could basically help us establish the platform and collaborate and work together in future.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-driving-vision-2030-forward"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving Vision 2030 forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Smart Data &amp;amp; AI Summit is a strategic initiative to support Saudi Arabia&amp;#8217;s Vision 2030 goals. By bringing together global expertise, cutting-edge technologies, and local insights, the summit aims to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foster innovation and collaboration across industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address regulatory challenges and ethical considerations in data and AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlock new opportunities for investment and growth in the Kingdom&amp;#8217;s data and AI sectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sudhir Ranjan Jena, CEO &amp;amp; Co-founder of Tradepass, the organising body, spoke of the summit&amp;#8217;s mission: &amp;#8220;The data &amp;amp; AI sector is entering a transformative chapter, fuelled by technology disruptions, heightened expectations, and the unprecedented expansion of digital tools and platforms.

&lt;p&gt;As Saudi Arabia accelerates its journey toward becoming a global leader in digital innovation, the Smart Data &amp;amp; AI Summit will play a pivotal role in shaping the Kingdom&amp;#8217;s data and AI landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scheduled for &lt;strong&gt;27-28 August 2025&lt;/strong&gt; at the JW Marriott Hotel in Riyadh, this event will bring together 300+ data and AI professionals, including CDOs, CIOs, data scientists, AI directors, C-suite executives and many others, to explore the latest advances, tackle challenges, and unlock opportunities in data and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the Kingdom&amp;#8217;s data analytics market projected to reach $8.8 billion by 2030, the summit comes at an important time, offering a platform for public and private sector leaders to collaborate, innovate, and approach the nation&amp;#8217;s Vision 2030 goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-platform-for-innovation-and-collaboration"&gt;A platform for innovation and collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building on the success of its debut last year, which was inaugurated by a leading official from the Saudi Data &amp;amp; AI Authority (SDAIA), the 2025 edition promises to be bigger and more impactful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The summit will feature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;300+ attendees&lt;/strong&gt;, including data engineers, architects, AI pioneers, and decision-makers from Saudi Arabia&amp;#8217;s largest organisations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:1 meetings&lt;/strong&gt; to foster collaboration and evaluate tailored solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CPD-accredited sessions&lt;/strong&gt; to help professionals enhance their skills and advance their careers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unveiling-the-future-of-data-and-ai"&gt;Unveiling the future of data and AI&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The summit&amp;#8217;s agenda will look at important topics shaping the future of data and AI, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating open data in Saudi Arabia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI fusion and machine learning innovations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data virtualisation and the power of data mesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical data governance and cybersecurity analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unified data cloud architectures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Discussions will be led by thought leaders from the Kingdom&amp;#8217;s top organisations, including Ministry of Hajj &amp;amp; Umrah, Insurance Authority, Council of Health Insurance, NEOM, AlNASSR Club Company | PIF, and Abdul Latif Jameel United Finance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dama-saudi-arabia-joins-as-supporting-partner"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAMA Saudi Arabia joins as supporting partner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Data Management Association (DAMA Saudi Arabia), the Kingdom&amp;#8217;s largest data management community, has joined the summit as a supporting partner. The partnership underscores DAMA&amp;#8217;s commitment to fostering a robust data management ecosystem and aligns with the summit&amp;#8217;s mission to elevate Saudi Arabia&amp;#8217;s position as a global leader in data and AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abdulaziz Almanea, Founder &amp;amp; Chairman of the Board, DAMA Saudi, spoke of the importance of the summit: &amp;#8220;Artificial intelligence is only as good as the data behind it. Quality, governance, and ethics must come first to ensure trust, accuracy, and impact. As Saudi Arabia accelerates its data-driven transformation, industry events like the Smart Data &amp;amp; AI Summit serve as vital platforms for bringing experts together to shape the future of AI with responsible and innovative data practices.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-legacy-of-excellence"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A legacy of excellence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The inaugural edition of the summit set a high benchmark, with attendees praising the quality of speakers, depth of discussions, and opportunities for networking and collaboration. Nayef Al-Otaibi, VP &amp;amp; Chief Digital Officer at Saudi Aramco, said, &amp;#8220;The event was well-managed, the coordination was excellent, and the quality of the speakers was above expectations. It was a beautiful experience connecting with industry experts during the panel discussions and sharing our experiences. This could basically help us establish the platform and collaborate and work together in future.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-driving-vision-2030-forward"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving Vision 2030 forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address regulatory challenges and ethical considerations in data and AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlock new opportunities for investment and growth in the Kingdom&amp;#8217;s data and AI sectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sudhir Ranjan Jena, CEO &amp;amp; Co-founder of Tradepass, the organising body, spoke of the summit&amp;#8217;s mission: &amp;#8220;The data &amp;amp; AI sector is entering a transformative chapter, fuelled by technology disruptions, heightened expectations, and the unprecedented expansion of digital tools and platforms. In the upcoming edition, we will delve into Vision 2030 goals, unlock limitless opportunities, and explore emerging trends and solutions that will play an integral role in shaping the Kingdom&amp;#8217;s post-oil economy.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is today&amp;#8217;s edition of¬†&lt;a href="https://forms.technologyreview.com/newsletters/briefing-the-download/?_ga=2.179569122.736533416.1649661040-405833893.1649413289"&gt;The Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;¬†our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&amp;#8217;s going on in the world of technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manus has kick-started an AI agent boom in China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, China saw a boom in foundation models, the do-everything large language models that underpin the AI revolution. This year, the focus has shifted to AI agents‚Äîsystems that are less about responding to users‚Äô queries and more about autonomously accomplishing things for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are now a host of Chinese startups building these general-purpose digital tools, which can answer emails, browse the internet to plan vacations, and even design an interactive website. Many of these have emerged in just the last two months, following in the footsteps of Manus‚Äîa general AI agent that sparked weeks of social media frenzy for invite codes after its limited-release launch in early March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the race to define what a useful AI agent looks like unfolds, a mix of ambitious startups and entrenched tech giants are now testing how these tools might actually work in practice‚Äîand for whom.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/05/1117958/china-ai-agent-boom/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄîCaiwei Chen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside the race to find GPS alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later this month, an inconspicuous 150-kilogram satellite is set to launch into space aboard the SpaceX Transporter 14 mission. Once in orbit, it will test super-accurate next-generation satnav technology designed to make up for the shortcomings of the US Global Positioning System (GPS).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the system‚Äôs indispensable nature, the GPS signal is easily suppressed or disrupted by everything from space weather to 5G cell towers to phone-size jammers worth a few tens of dollars. The problem has been whispered about among experts for years, but it has really come to the fore in the last three years, since Russia invaded Ukraine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, startup Xona Space Systems wants to create a space-based system that would do what GPS does but better. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/06/1117978/inside-the-race-to-find-gps-alternatives/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why doctors should look for ways to prescribe hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄîJessica Hamzelou&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, I‚Äôve been thinking about the powerful connection between mind and body. Some new research suggests that people with heart conditions have better outcomes when they are more hopeful and optimistic. Hopelessness, on the other hand, is associated with a significantly higher risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings build upon decades of fascinating research into the phenomenon of the placebo effect. Our beliefs and expectations about a medicine (or a sham treatment) can change the way it works. The placebo effect‚Äôs ‚Äúevil twin,‚Äù the nocebo effect, is just as powerful‚Äînegative thinking has been linked to real symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still trying to understand the connection between body and mind, and how our thoughts can influence our physiology. In the meantime, many are developing ways to harness it in hospital settings. Is it possible for a doctor to prescribe hope? &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/06/1117937/why-doctors-should-look-for-ways-to-prescribe-hope/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I‚Äôve combed the internet to find you today‚Äôs most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Elon Musk threatened to cut off NASA‚Äôs use of SpaceX‚Äôs Dragon spacecraft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His war of words with Donald Trump is dramatically escalating.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 X‚Äôs new policy blocks the use of its posts to ‚Äòfine-tune or train‚Äô AI models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless companies strike a deal with them, that is.

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manus has kick-started an AI agent boom in China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, China saw a boom in foundation models, the do-everything large language models that underpin the AI revolution. This year, the focus has shifted to AI agents‚Äîsystems that are less about responding to users‚Äô queries and more about autonomously accomplishing things for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are now a host of Chinese startups building these general-purpose digital tools, which can answer emails, browse the internet to plan vacations, and even design an interactive website. Many of these have emerged in just the last two months, following in the footsteps of Manus‚Äîa general AI agent that sparked weeks of social media frenzy for invite codes after its limited-release launch in early March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the race to define what a useful AI agent looks like unfolds, a mix of ambitious startups and entrenched tech giants are now testing how these tools might actually work in practice‚Äîand for whom.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/05/1117958/china-ai-agent-boom/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside the race to find GPS alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later this month, an inconspicuous 150-kilogram satellite is set to launch into space aboard the SpaceX Transporter 14 mission. Once in orbit, it will test super-accurate next-generation satnav technology designed to make up for the shortcomings of the US Global Positioning System (GPS).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the system‚Äôs indispensable nature, the GPS signal is easily suppressed or disrupted by everything from space weather to 5G cell towers to phone-size jammers worth a few tens of dollars. The problem has been whispered about among experts for years, but it has really come to the fore in the last three years, since Russia invaded Ukraine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, startup Xona Space Systems wants to create a space-based system that would do what GPS does but better. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/06/1117978/inside-the-race-to-find-gps-alternatives/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why doctors should look for ways to prescribe hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄîJessica Hamzelou&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, I‚Äôve been thinking about the powerful connection between mind and body. Some new research suggests that people with heart conditions have better outcomes when they are more hopeful and optimistic. Hopelessness, on the other hand, is associated with a significantly higher risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings build upon decades of fascinating research into the phenomenon of the placebo effect. Our beliefs and expectations about a medicine (or a sham treatment) can change the way it works. The placebo effect‚Äôs ‚Äúevil twin,‚Äù the nocebo effect, is just as powerful‚Äînegative thinking has been linked to real symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still trying to understand the connection between body and mind, and how our thoughts can influence our physiology. In the meantime, many are developing ways to harness it in hospital settings. Is it possible for a doctor to prescribe hope? &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/06/1117937/why-doctors-should-look-for-ways-to-prescribe-hope/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Full article available at source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has unveiled a custom collection of Claude AI models designed for US national security customers. The announcement represents a potential milestone in the application of AI &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/uk-deploys-ai-to-boost-arctic-security-amid-growing-threats/"&gt;within classified government&lt;/a&gt; environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ‚ÄòClaude Gov‚Äô models have already been deployed by agencies operating at the highest levels of US national security, with access strictly limited to those working within such classified environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic says these Claude Gov models emerged from extensive collaboration with government customers to address real-world operational requirements. Despite being tailored for national security applications, Anthropic maintains that these models underwent the same rigorous safety testing as other Claude models in their portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-specialised-ai-capabilities-for-national-security"&gt;Specialised AI capabilities for national security&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The specialised models deliver improved performance across several critical areas for government operations. They feature enhanced handling of classified materials, with fewer instances where the AI refuses to engage with sensitive information‚Äîa common frustration in secure environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additional improvements include better comprehension of documents within intelligence and defence contexts, enhanced proficiency in languages crucial to national security operations, and superior interpretation of complex cybersecurity data for intelligence analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this announcement arrives amid ongoing debates about AI regulation in the US. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently expressed concerns about proposed legislation that would grant a decade-long freeze on state regulation of AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-innovation-with-regulation"&gt;Balancing innovation with regulation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a guest essay published in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/international/"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; this week, Amodei advocated for transparency rules rather than regulatory moratoriums. He detailed internal evaluations revealing concerning behaviours in advanced AI models, including an instance where Anthropic&amp;#8217;s newest model threatened to expose a user&amp;#8217;s private emails unless a shutdown plan was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amodei compared AI safety testing to wind tunnel trials for aircraft designed to expose defects before public release, emphasising that safety teams must detect and block risks proactively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has positioned itself as an advocate for responsible AI development. Under its Responsible Scaling Policy, the company already shares details about testing methods, risk-mitigation steps, and release criteria‚Äîpractices Amodei believes should become standard across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He suggests that formalising similar practices industry-wide would enable both the public and legislators to monitor capability improvements and determine whether additional regulatory action becomes necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-of-ai-in-national-security"&gt;Implications of AI in national security&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deployment of advanced models within national security contexts raises important questions about the role of AI in intelligence gathering, strategic planning, and defence operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amodei has expressed support for export controls &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/huawei-supernode-384-disrupts-nvidia-ai-market-hold/"&gt;on advanced chips&lt;/a&gt; and the military adoption of trusted systems to counter rivals like China, indicating Anthropic&amp;#8217;s awareness of the geopolitical implications of AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Claude Gov models could potentially serve numerous applications for national security, from strategic planning and operational support to intelligence analysis and threat assessment‚Äîall within the framework of Anthropic&amp;#8217;s stated commitment to responsible AI development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regulatory-landscape"&gt;Regulatory landscape&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Anthropic rolls out these specialised models for government use, the broader regulatory environment for AI remains in flux. The Senate is currently considering language that would institute a moratorium on state-level AI regulation, with hearings planned before voting on the broader technology measure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amodei has suggested that states could adopt narrow disclosure rules that defer to a future federal framework, with a supremacy clause eventually preempting state measures to preserve uniformity without halting near-term local action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach would allow for some immediate regulatory protection while working toward a comprehensive national standard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As these technologies become more deeply integrated into national security operations, questions of safety, oversight, and appropriate use will remain at the forefront of both policy discussions and public debate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Anthropic, the challenge will be maintaining its commitment to responsible AI development while meeting the specialised needs of government customers for crtitical applications such as national security.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can bias policy learning in reinforcement learning (RL), leading to suboptimal or non-generalizable behavior. Most RL algorithms ignore this issue, learning policies from observational trajectories based solely on statistical associations rather than causal effects. We propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention estimation. DoSAC estimates the interventional policy $\pi(a | \mathrm{do}(s))$ using the backdoor criterion, without requiring access to true confounders or causal labels. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor that infers pseudo-past variables (previous state and action) from the current state to enable backdoor adjustment from observational data. This module is integrated into a soft actor-critic framework to compute both the interventional policy and its entropy. Empirical results on continuous control benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings, with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05445v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences, structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05443v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Health indicator (HI) plays a key role in degradation assessment and prognostics of rolling bearings. Although various HI construction methods have been investigated, most of them rely on expert knowledge for feature extraction and overlook capturing dynamic information hidden in sequential degradation processes, which limits the ability of the constructed HI for degradation trend representation and prognostics. To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI that considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an unsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module composed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a representative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract essential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge. Subsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner HI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal dependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled explicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic contents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on two bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction method outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is superior for prognostic tasks.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05438v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Package monitoring is an important topic in industrial applications, with significant implications for operational efficiency and ecological sustainability. In this study, we propose an approach that employs an embedded system, placed on reusable packages, to detect their state (on a Forklift, in a Truck, or in an undetermined location). We aim to design a system with a lifespan of several years, corresponding to the lifespan of reusable packages. Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption of 316 mW during inference.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05435v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but, for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a 1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet. Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05434v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO: it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged. Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training, particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy. Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner. However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works, places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\% zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly compressed LLMs.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05432v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Early prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion is hampered by a trade-off between immediacy--making fast predictions from a single baseline sMRI--and accuracy--leveraging longitudinal scans to capture disease progression. We propose MCI-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes clinically plausible future sMRI representations directly from baseline data, achieving both real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance. First, a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy trains a shared denoising network on interpolation and extrapolation tasks to handle irregular follow-up sampling and learn robust latent trajectories. Second, an LLM-driven "linguistic compass" is introduced for clinical plausibility sampling: generated feature candidates are quantized, tokenized, and scored by a fine-tuned language model conditioned on expected structural biomarkers, guiding autoregressive generation toward realistic disease patterns. Experiments on ADNI and AIBL cohorts show that MCI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05428v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug discovery and material design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding targets, which restricts the applicability of these prediction models. In this paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their target proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS) guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream GNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through conditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs, helping to accelerate compound optimization and design.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning. However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise \textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer toward achievements in language and vision communities.

Abstract: Recent large-scale reasoning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms underlying their success remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce the notion of a reasoning graph, extracted by clustering hidden-state representations at each reasoning step, and systematically analyze three key graph-theoretic properties: cyclicity, diameter, and small-world index, across multiple tasks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME 2024). Our findings reveal that distilled reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) exhibit significantly more recurrent cycles (about 5 per sample), substantially larger graph diameters, and pronounced small-world characteristics (about 6x) compared to their base counterparts. Notably, these structural advantages grow with task difficulty and model capacity, with cycle detection peaking at the 14B scale and exploration diameter maximized in the 32B variant, correlating positively with accuracy. Furthermore, we show that supervised fine-tuning on an improved dataset systematically expands reasoning graph diameters in tandem with performance gains, offering concrete guidelines for dataset design aimed at boosting reasoning capabilities. By bridging theoretical insights into reasoning graph structures with practical recommendations for data construction, our work advances both the interpretability and the efficacy of large reasoning models.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05744v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups. The objective of this paper is to develop a novel preference learning framework capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Our approach infers the feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of population-proportional representation and population-bounded robustness. We propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs population-proportional representation with the selection of the Condorcet winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments on both tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05619v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning, physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous materials discovery.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05616v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers, data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks, evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills -- including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing foundation models for structured data processing and analysis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions, isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization. Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to support future work on communicatively aligned models.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05579v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning algorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These behaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition, curriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex behaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for engineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in engineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments containing states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to the agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to the agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by early amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic motivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response is active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm of general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the Miniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal condition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning paradigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent that is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05529v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents, and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements, balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes. Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous data systems leveraging AI agents.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05520v1 Announce Type: new

Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes. Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous data systems leveraging AI agents.</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05520</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Constructive Symbolic Reinforcement Learning via Intuitionistic Logic and Goal-Chaining Inference (cs.AI updates on arXiv.org)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05422</link><description>arXiv:2506.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel learning and planning framework that replaces traditional reward-based optimisation with constructive logical inference. In our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions -- eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld, where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals (e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking, and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but in constructive logic and proof theory.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05422v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory, human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history, judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration, generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05370v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: This work lays the foundations for a rigorous ontological characterization of love, addressing its philosophical complexity and scientific relevance, with particular emphasis on psychology and sociology, as well as highlighting ways in which such characterization enhances relevant AI based applications. The position defended here is that love is best understood as a concatenation of passive sensations (e.g., emotional arousal) and active evaluative judgments (e.g., perceiving the beloved as valuable), in the interest of balancing the involuntary aspects of love with its rational accountability. To provide a structured foundation, the paper draws on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and other applied ontological methods to differentiate various senses of love. This work engages with objections to the understanding of love as concatenation, particularly concerning the relationship between sensation and judgment. A causal correlation model is defended, ensuring that the affective and cognitive components are linked. By offering a precise and scalable ontological account, this work lays the foundation for future interdisciplinary applications, making love a subject of formal inquiry in ontology engineering, artificial intelligence, and the sciences.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.05352v1 Announce Type: new

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How a 1980s toy robot arm inspired modern robotics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄîJon Keegan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a child of an electronic engineer, I spent a lot of time in our local Radio Shack as a kid. While my dad was locating capacitors and resistors, I was in the toy section. It was there, in 1984, that I discovered the best toy of my childhood: the Armatron robotic arm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Described as a ‚Äúrobot-like arm to aid young masterminds in scientific and laboratory experiments,‚Äù it was a legit robotic arm. And the bold look and function of Armatron made quite an impression on many young kids who would one day have a career in robotics. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/17/1114456/toy-armatron-modern-robotics-ai-nostalgia/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How a 1980s toy robot arm inspired modern robotics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄîJon Keegan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a child of an electronic engineer, I spent a lot of time in our local Radio Shack as a kid. While my dad was locating capacitors and resistors, I was in the toy section. It was there, in 1984, that I discovered the best toy of my childhood: the Armatron robotic arm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Described as a ‚Äúrobot-like arm to aid young masterminds in scientific and laboratory experiments,‚Äù it was a legit robotic arm. And the bold look and function of Armatron made quite an impression on many young kids who would one day have a career in robotics. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/17/1114456/toy-armatron-modern-robotics-ai-nostalgia/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
