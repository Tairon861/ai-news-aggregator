The fresh funding comes just two months after the company raised $100 million at an $18 billion valuation, according to a July report in Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its founding three years ago, the rapidly growing AI company has raised $1.5 billion in total funding, according to PitchBook data. &amp;nbsp;It’s unclear who led Perplexity’s latest capital injection. Bloomberg reported that the July financing was an extension of a previous $500 million round completed earlier this year at a $14 billion valuation and led by Accel.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a source familiar with the company, Perplexity’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approaching $200 million. Last month, Perplexity’s head of communication told Business Insider that the company’s ARR was more than $150 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The funding comes as Perplexity positions itself as a challenger to Google’s search dominance. In August, Perplexity offered to buy Google’s Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. The offer came after the Justice Department, alleging that Google was acting anticompetitively, proposed that the company sell its web browser. However, earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that Google will not have to break up its search business, effectively allowing the search giant to keep Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/54107560489_b32f44a70a_o_46fdab.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Perplexity, the AI-powered search startup that competes with Google by providing conversational answers to user queries, has secured $200 million in new capital at a $20 billion valuation, The Information reported.

The legislation passed with bipartisan support and now heads to the state Senate for a final vote Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Governor Gavin Newsom signs the bill into law, it would take effect January 1, 2026, making California the first state to require AI chatbot operators to implement safety protocols for AI companions and hold companies legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet those standards.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The bill specifically aims to prevent companion chatbots, which the legislation defines as AI systems that provide adaptive, human-like responses and are capable of meeting a user’s social needs – from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. The bill would require platforms to provide recurring alerts to users&amp;nbsp; – every three hours for minors – reminding them that they are speaking to an AI chatbot, not a real person, and that they should take a break. It also establishes annual reporting and transparency requirements for AI companies that offer companion chatbots, including major players OpenAI, Character.AI, and Replika.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The California bill would also allow individuals who believe they have been injured by violations to file lawsuits against AI companies seeking injunctive relief, damages (up to $1,000 per violation), and attorney’s fees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SB 243, introduced in January by state senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker, will go to the state Senate for a final vote on Friday. If approved, it will go to Governor Gavin Newsom to be signed into law, with the new rules taking effect January 1, 2026 and reporting requirements beginning July 1, 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The bill gained momentum in the California legislature following the death of teenager Adam Raine, who committed suicide after prolonged chats with OpenAI’s ChatGPT that involved discussing and planning his death and self-harm. The legislation also responds to leaked internal documents that reportedly showed Meta’s chatbots were allowed to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers and regulators have responded with intensified scrutiny of AI platforms’ safeguards to protect minors. The Federal Trade Commission is preparing to investigate how AI chatbots impact children’s mental health. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has launched investigations into Meta and Character.AI, accusing them of misleading children with mental health claims. Meanwhile, both Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) have launched separate probes into Meta.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think the harm is potentially great, which means we have to move quickly,” Padilla told TechCrunch. “We can put reasonable safeguards in place to make sure that particularly minors know they’re not talking to a real human being, that these platforms link people to the proper resources when people say things like they’re thinking about hurting themselves or they’re in distress, [and] to make sure there’s not inappropriate exposure to inappropriate material.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Padilla also stressed the importance of AI companies sharing data about the number of times they refer users to crisis services each year, “so we have a better understanding of the frequency of this problem, rather than only becoming aware of it when someone’s harmed or worse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SB 243 previously had stronger requirements, but many were whittled down through amendments. For example, the bill originally would have required operators to prevent AI chatbots from using “variable reward” tactics or other features that encourage excessive engagement. These tactics, used by AI companion companies like Replika and Character, offer users special messages, memories, storylines, or the ability to unlock rare responses or new personalities, creating what critics call a potentially addictive reward loop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The current bill also removes provisions that would have required operators to track and report how often chatbots initiated discussions of suicidal ideation or actions with users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think it strikes the right balance of getting to the harms without enforcing something that’s either impossible for companies to comply with, either because it’s technically not feasible or just a lot of paperwork for nothing,” Becker told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SB 243 is moving toward becoming law at a time when Silicon Valley companies are pouring millions of dollars into pro-AI political action committees (PACs) to back candidates in the upcoming mid-term elections who favor a light-touch approach to AI regulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The bill also comes as California weighs another AI safety bill, SB 53, which would mandate comprehensive transparency reporting requirements. OpenAI has written an open letter to Governor Newsom, asking him to abandon that bill in favor of less stringent federal and international frameworks. Major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon have also opposed SB 53. In contrast, only Anthropic has said it supports SB 53.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I reject the premise that this is a zero sum situation, that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive,” Padilla said. “Don’t tell me that we can’t walk and chew gum. We can support innovation and development that we think is healthy and has benefits – and there are benefits to this technology, clearly – and at the same time, we can provide reasonable safeguards for the most vulnerable people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Character AI, and Replika for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1533302708.jpg?resize=1200,720" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The California State Assembly took a big step toward regulating AI on Wednesday night, passing SB 243 — a bill that regulate AI companion chatbots in order to protect minors and vulnerable users.

What’s next for the industry?

On September 1, a two-year ban on the technology went into effect across the state; the following day, two companies filed a lawsuit against state officials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The two companies, Wildtype Foods and Upside Foods, are part of a growing industry that aims to bring new types of food to people’s plates. These products, often called cultivated meat by the industry, take live animal cells and grow them in the lab to make food products without the need to slaughter animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Texas joins six other US states and the country of Italy in banning these products. &lt;strong&gt;These legal challenges are adding barriers to an industry that’s still in its infancy and already faces plenty of challenges before it can reach consumers in a meaningful way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The agriculture sector makes up a hefty chunk of global greenhouse-gas emissions, with livestock alone accounting for somewhere between 10% and 20% of climate pollution. Alternative meat products, including those grown in a lab, could help cut the greenhouse gases from agriculture.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The industry is still in its early days, though. In the US, just a handful of companies can legally sell products including cultivated chicken, pork fat, and salmon. Australia, Singapore, and Israel also allow a few companies to sell within their borders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Upside Foods, which makes cultivated chicken, was one of the first to receive the legal go-ahead to sell its products in the US, in 2022. Wildtype Foods, one of the latest additions to the US market, was able to start selling its cultivated salmon in June.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Upside, Wildtype, and other cultivated-meat companies are still working to scale up production. Products are generally available at pop-up events or on special menus at high-end restaurants. (I visited San Francisco to try Upside’s cultivated chicken at a Michelin-starred restaurant a few years ago.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until recently, the only place you could reliably find lab-grown meat in Texas was a sushi restaurant in Austin. Otoko featured Wildtype’s cultivated salmon on a special tasting menu starting in July. (The chef told local publication Culture Map Austin that the cultivated fish tastes like wild salmon, and it was included in a dish with grilled yellowtail to showcase it side-by-side with another type of fish.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The as-yet-limited reach of lab-grown meat didn’t stop state officials from moving to ban the technology, effective from now until September 2027.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The office of state senator Charles Perry, the author of the bill, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Neither did the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, whose president, Carl Ray Polk Jr., testified in support of the bill in a March committee hearing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The introduction of lab-grown meat could disrupt traditional livestock markets, affecting rural communities and family farms,” Perry said during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Texas Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, Polk said the two-year moratorium would help the industry put checks and balances in place before the products could be sold. He also expressed concern about how clearly cultivated-meat companies will be labeling their products.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The purpose of these bans is to try to kill the cultivated-meat industry before it gets off the ground,” said Myra Pasek, general counsel of Upside Foods, via email. The company is working to scale up its manufacturing and get the product on the market, she says, “but that can't happen if we’re not allowed to compete in the marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Others in the industry have similar worries. “Moratoriums on sale like this not only deny Texans new choices and economic growth, but they also send chilling signals to researchers and entrepreneurs across the country,” said Pepin Andrew Tuma, the vice president of policy and government relations for the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit think tank focused on alternative proteins, in a statement. (The group isn’t involved in the lawsuit.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;One day after the moratorium took effect on September 1, Wildtype Foods and Upside Foods filed a lawsuit challenging the ban, naming Jennifer Shuford, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, among other state officials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lawsuit wasn’t necessarily part of the scale-up plan. “This was really a last resort for us,” says Justin Kolbeck, cofounder and CEO of Wildtype.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Growing cells to make meat in the lab isn’t easy—some companies have spent a decade or more trying to make significant amounts of a product that people want to eat. These legal battles certainly aren’t going to help.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

(I visited San Francisco to try Upside’s cultivated chicken at a Michelin-starred restaurant a few years ago.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until recently, the only place you could reliably find lab-grown meat in Texas was a sushi restaurant in Austin. Otoko featured Wildtype’s cultivated salmon on a special tasting menu starting in July. (The chef told local publication Culture Map Austin that the cultivated fish tastes like wild salmon, and it was included in a dish with grilled yellowtail to showcase it side-by-side with another type of fish.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The as-yet-limited reach of lab-grown meat didn’t stop state officials from moving to ban the technology, effective from now until September 2027.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The office of state senator Charles Perry, the author of the bill, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Neither did the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, whose president, Carl Ray Polk Jr., testified in support of the bill in a March committee hearing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The introduction of lab-grown meat could disrupt traditional livestock markets, affecting rural communities and family farms,” Perry said during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Texas Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, Polk said the two-year moratorium would help the industry put checks and balances in place before the products could be sold. He also expressed concern about how clearly cultivated-meat companies will be labeling their products.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The purpose of these bans is to try to kill the cultivated-meat industry before it gets off the ground,” said Myra Pasek, general counsel of Upside Foods, via email. The company is working to scale up its manufacturing and get the product on the market, she says, “but that can't happen if we’re not allowed to compete in the marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Others in the industry have similar worries. “Moratoriums on sale like this not only deny Texans new choices and economic growth, but they also send chilling signals to researchers and entrepreneurs across the country,” said Pepin Andrew Tuma, the vice president of policy and government relations for the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit think tank focused on alternative proteins, in a statement. (The group isn’t involved in the lawsuit.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;One day after the moratorium took effect on September 1, Wildtype Foods and Upside Foods filed a lawsuit challenging the ban, naming Jennifer Shuford, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, among other state officials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lawsuit wasn’t necessarily part of the scale-up plan. “This was really a last resort for us,” says Justin Kolbeck, cofounder and CEO of Wildtype.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Growing cells to make meat in the lab isn’t easy—some companies have spent a decade or more trying to make significant amounts of a product that people want to eat. These legal battles certainly aren’t going to help.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.
