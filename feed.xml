Now, we have an idea of who those customers might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Oracle signed a deal with OpenAI for the AI company to purchase $300 billion worth of compute power over a span of about five years, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal. OpenAI would start purchasing this compute in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If the WSJ’s reporting is correct, this would be one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed. Oracle declined to comment. OpenAI did not respond to a request for confirmation or comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Oracle is no stranger to working with OpenAI. OpenAI started tapping Oracle for compute in the summer of 2024. The AI giant also moved further away from exclusively using Microsoft Azure as its only cloud provider in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This move away from Microsoft was timed with OpenAI’s involvement with the Stargate Project, in which OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle have committed to invest $500 billion into domestic data center projects over the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI clearly needs as much compute as it can get. The company reportedly signed a cloud deal with Google, according to Reuters, this spring despite the fact that the two companies are racing against each other for AI supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197181602.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Oracle sent its shares soaring after markets closed yesterday after reporting that it signed multiple multi-billion-dollar contracts with several customers.

          &lt;p&gt;Google is one of the most ardent proponents of generative AI technology, as evidenced by the recent launch of the Pixel 10 series. The phones were announced with more than 20 new AI experiences, according to Google. However, one of them is already being pulled from the company's phones. If you go looking for your Daily Hub, you may be disappointed. Not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; disappointed, though, as it has been pulled because it didn't do very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Google's new AI features only make themselves known in specific circumstances, for example when Magic Cue finds an opportunity to suggest an address or calendar appointment based on your screen context. The Daily Hub, on the other hand, asserted itself multiple times throughout the day. It appeared at the top of the Google Discover feed, as well as in the At a Glance widget right at the top of the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks after release, Google has pulled the Daily Hub preview from Pixel 10 devices. You will no longer see it in Google Discover nor in the home screen widget. After being spotted by 9to5Google, the company has issued a statement explaining its plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To ensure the best possible experience on Pixel, we’re temporarily pausing the public preview of Daily Hub for users. Our teams are actively working to enhance its performance and refine the personalized experience. We look forward to reintroducing an improved Daily Hub when it’s ready," a Google spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not surprising that Google has hit pause on Daily Hub. Google's approach to mobile AI relies on the Tensor processor's capable NPU. Pixel phones process your personal data on-device rather than sending it to the cloud, which is how Daily Hub is supposed to glean insights into your life. The problem is that it doesn't do that very well.&lt;/p&gt;

      Daily Hub wasn't smart enough to understand the "nail services" were on my wife's shared calendar.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned in our review of the Pixel 10 series, Daily Hub's premise is similar to Samsung's Now Brief. They both pull in data from your apps and run it all through on-device AI models to create a digest of your life that is refreshed multiple times per day. Samsung has continued promoting Now Brief as its chief AI innovation despite the fact that it rarely offers more than the weather and calendar reminders. Google's Daily Hub was in a similar place, but it may have been even less useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our testing, Daily Hub rarely showed anything beyond the weather, suggested videos, and AI search prompts. When it did integrate calendar data, it seemed unable to differentiate between the user's own calendar and data from shared calendars. This largely useless report was pushed to the At a Glance widget multiple times per day, making it more of a nuisance than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones are overflowing with personal data, which is one of the reasons they are such attractive targets for hackers. Despite this, both Samsung and Google have found little success generating useful daily insights with on-device AI models. We wait with bated breath to see if Google can make Daily Hub worth using when it returns.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned in our review of the Pixel 10 series, Daily Hub's premise is similar to Samsung's Now Brief. They both pull in data from your apps and run it all through on-device AI models to create a digest of your life that is refreshed multiple times per day. Samsung has continued promoting Now Brief as its chief AI innovation despite the fact that it rarely offers more than the weather and calendar reminders. Google's Daily Hub was in a similar place, but it may have been even less useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our testing, Daily Hub rarely showed anything beyond the weather, suggested videos, and AI search prompts. When it did integrate calendar data, it seemed unable to differentiate between the user's own calendar and data from shared calendars. This largely useless report was pushed to the At a Glance widget multiple times per day, making it more of a nuisance than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones are overflowing with personal data, which is one of the reasons they are such attractive targets for hackers. Despite this, both Samsung and Google have found little success generating useful daily insights with on-device AI models. We wait with bated breath to see if Google can make Daily Hub worth using when it returns.&lt;/p&gt;

In a blog post published on Wednesday, Murati’s research lab gave the world its first look into one of its projects: creating AI models with reproducible responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The research blog post, titled “Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference,” tries to unpack the root cause of what introduces randomness in AI model responses. For example, ask ChatGPT the same question a few times over, and you’re likely to get a wide range of answers. This has largely been accepted in the AI community as a fact — today’s AI models are considered to be non-deterministic systems— but Thinking Machines Lab sees this as a solvable problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;Today Thinking Machines Lab is launching our research blog, Connectionism. Our first blog post is “Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that science is better when shared. Connectionism will cover topics as varied as our research is: from kernel numerics to… pic.twitter.com/jMFL3xt67C&lt;/p&gt;— Thinking Machines (@thinkymachines) September 10, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The post, authored by Thinking Machines Lab researcher Horace He, argues that the root cause of AI models’ randomness is the way GPU kernels — the small programs that run inside of Nvidia’s computer chips — are stitched together in inference processing (everything that happens after you press enter in ChatGPT). He suggests that by carefully controlling this layer of orchestration, it’s possible to make AI models more deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond creating more reliable responses for enterprises and scientists, He notes that getting AI models to generate reproducible responses could also improve reinforcement learning (RL) training. RL is the process of rewarding AI models for correct answers, but if the answers are all slightly different, then the data gets a bit noisy. Creating more consistent AI model responses could make the whole RL process “smoother,” according to He. Thinking Machines Lab has told investors that it plans to use RL to customize AI models for businesses, The Information previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Murati, OpenAI’s former chief technology officer, said in July that Thinking Machines Lab’s first product will be unveiled in the coming months, and that it will be “useful for researchers and startups developing custom models.” It’s still unclear what that product is, or whether it will use techniques from this research to generate more reproducible responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Thinking Machines Lab has also said that it plans to frequently publish blog posts, code, and other information about its research in an effort to “benefit the public, but also improve our own research culture.” This post, the first in the company’s new blog series called “Connectionism,” seems to be part of that effort. OpenAI also made a commitment to open research when it was founded, but the company has become more closed off as it’s become larger. We’ll see if Murati’s research lab stays true to this claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The research blog offers a rare glimpse inside one of Silicon Valley’s most secretive AI startups. While it doesn’t exactly reveal where the technology is going, it indicates that Thinking Machines Lab is tackling some of the largest question on the frontier of AI research. The real test is whether Thinking Machines Lab can solve these problems, and make products around its research to justify its $12 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

The fresh funding comes just two months after the company raised $100 million at an $18 billion valuation, according to a July report in Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its founding three years ago, the rapidly growing AI company has raised $1.5 billion in total funding, according to PitchBook data. &amp;nbsp;It’s unclear who led Perplexity’s latest capital injection. Bloomberg reported that the July financing was an extension of a previous $500 million round completed earlier this year at a $14 billion valuation and led by Accel.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a source familiar with the company, Perplexity’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approaching $200 million. Last month, Perplexity’s head of communication told Business Insider that the company’s ARR was more than $150 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The funding comes as Perplexity positions itself as a challenger to Google’s search dominance. In August, Perplexity offered to buy Google’s Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. The offer came after the Justice Department, alleging that Google was acting anticompetitively, proposed that the company sell its web browser. However, earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that Google will not have to break up its search business, effectively allowing the search giant to keep Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/54107560489_b32f44a70a_o_46fdab.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Perplexity, the AI-powered search startup that competes with Google by providing conversational answers to user queries, has secured $200 million in new capital at a $20 billion valuation, The Information reported.

The legislation passed with bipartisan support and now heads to the state Senate for a final vote Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Governor Gavin Newsom signs the bill into law, it would take effect January 1, 2026, making California the first state to require AI chatbot operators to implement safety protocols for AI companions and hold companies legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet those standards.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The bill specifically aims to prevent companion chatbots, which the legislation defines as AI systems that provide adaptive, human-like responses and are capable of meeting a user’s social needs – from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. The bill would require platforms to provide recurring alerts to users&amp;nbsp; – every three hours for minors – reminding them that they are speaking to an AI chatbot, not a real person, and that they should take a break. It also establishes annual reporting and transparency requirements for AI companies that offer companion chatbots, including major players OpenAI, Character.AI, and Replika.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The California bill would also allow individuals who believe they have been injured by violations to file lawsuits against AI companies seeking injunctive relief, damages (up to $1,000 per violation), and attorney’s fees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SB 243, introduced in January by state senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker, will go to the state Senate for a final vote on Friday. If approved, it will go to Governor Gavin Newsom to be signed into law, with the new rules taking effect January 1, 2026 and reporting requirements beginning July 1, 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The bill gained momentum in the California legislature following the death of teenager Adam Raine, who committed suicide after prolonged chats with OpenAI’s ChatGPT that involved discussing and planning his death and self-harm. The legislation also responds to leaked internal documents that reportedly showed Meta’s chatbots were allowed to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers and regulators have responded with intensified scrutiny of AI platforms’ safeguards to protect minors. The Federal Trade Commission is preparing to investigate how AI chatbots impact children’s mental health. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has launched investigations into Meta and Character.AI, accusing them of misleading children with mental health claims. Meanwhile, both Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) have launched separate probes into Meta.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think the harm is potentially great, which means we have to move quickly,” Padilla told TechCrunch. “We can put reasonable safeguards in place to make sure that particularly minors know they’re not talking to a real human being, that these platforms link people to the proper resources when people say things like they’re thinking about hurting themselves or they’re in distress, [and] to make sure there’s not inappropriate exposure to inappropriate material.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Padilla also stressed the importance of AI companies sharing data about the number of times they refer users to crisis services each year, “so we have a better understanding of the frequency of this problem, rather than only becoming aware of it when someone’s harmed or worse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SB 243 previously had stronger requirements, but many were whittled down through amendments. For example, the bill originally would have required operators to prevent AI chatbots from using “variable reward” tactics or other features that encourage excessive engagement. These tactics, used by AI companion companies like Replika and Character, offer users special messages, memories, storylines, or the ability to unlock rare responses or new personalities, creating what critics call a potentially addictive reward loop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The current bill also removes provisions that would have required operators to track and report how often chatbots initiated discussions of suicidal ideation or actions with users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think it strikes the right balance of getting to the harms without enforcing something that’s either impossible for companies to comply with, either because it’s technically not feasible or just a lot of paperwork for nothing,” Becker told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SB 243 is moving toward becoming law at a time when Silicon Valley companies are pouring millions of dollars into pro-AI political action committees (PACs) to back candidates in the upcoming mid-term elections who favor a light-touch approach to AI regulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The bill also comes as California weighs another AI safety bill, SB 53, which would mandate comprehensive transparency reporting requirements. OpenAI has written an open letter to Governor Newsom, asking him to abandon that bill in favor of less stringent federal and international frameworks. Major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon have also opposed SB 53. In contrast, only Anthropic has said it supports SB 53.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I reject the premise that this is a zero sum situation, that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive,” Padilla said. “Don’t tell me that we can’t walk and chew gum. We can support innovation and development that we think is healthy and has benefits – and there are benefits to this technology, clearly – and at the same time, we can provide reasonable safeguards for the most vulnerable people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Character AI, and Replika for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1533302708.jpg?resize=1200,720" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The California State Assembly took a big step toward regulating AI on Wednesday night, passing SB 243 — a bill that regulate AI companion chatbots in order to protect minors and vulnerable users.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think it strikes the right balance of getting to the harms without enforcing something that’s either impossible for companies to comply with, either because it’s technically not feasible or just a lot of paperwork for nothing,” Becker told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SB 243 is moving toward becoming law at a time when Silicon Valley companies are pouring millions of dollars into pro-AI political action committees (PACs) to back candidates in the upcoming mid-term elections who favor a light-touch approach to AI regulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The bill also comes as California weighs another AI safety bill, SB 53, which would mandate comprehensive transparency reporting requirements. OpenAI has written an open letter to Governor Newsom, asking him to abandon that bill in favor of less stringent federal and international frameworks. Major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon have also opposed SB 53. In contrast, only Anthropic has said it supports SB 53.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I reject the premise that this is a zero sum situation, that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive,” Padilla said. “Don’t tell me that we can’t walk and chew gum. We can support innovation and development that we think is healthy and has benefits – and there are benefits to this technology, clearly – and at the same time, we can provide reasonable safeguards for the most vulnerable people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Character AI, and Replika for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/a-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 05:10:51 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
