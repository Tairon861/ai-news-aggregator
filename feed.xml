&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In replies to users on Friday, Grok said only paying subscribers on X would be able to generate and edit images on the platform. Notably, these limits do not apply to the Grok app, which, at the time of publication was letting anyone generate pictures without having to pay for a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Initially available to anyone with daily limits, Grok’s image-generation feature allowed users to upload anyone’s picture and ask it to edit it or generate a sexualized or nude version. What ensued was a veritable flood of non-consensual sexualized images of children, actors, models and prominent figures, drawing the ire of multiple nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;X and Musk have both publicly denounced the use of the tool to produce such images, writing that the company would stick to its policies against posting illegal content on the social media platform. “Anyone using grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk tweeted last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The U.K., the European Union, and India have all publicly denounced X and Grok for allowing such use of its capabilities. The EU on Thursday asked xAI to retain all documentation relating to the chatbot, and India’s communications ministry last week ordered X to make immediate changes to stop the image-generation features from being misused or risk its safe harbor protections in the country. The U.K.’s communications watchdog said it’s been in touch with xAI over the issue as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/xAI-Grok-GettyImages-1765893916.jpeg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI company has restricted Grok’s controversial AI image-generation feature to only paying subscribers on X, after the tool invited heavy criticism from across the world for letting users generate sexualized and nude images of women and children. &lt;/p&gt;

The journey feels fine until the car misreads a shadow or slows abruptly for something harmless. In that moment you see the real issue with autonomy. It does not panic when it should, and that gap between confidence and judgement is where trust is either earned or lost. Much of today’s enterprise AI feels remarkably similar. It is competent without being confident, and efficient without being empathetic, which is why the deciding factor in every successful deployment is no longer computing power but trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MLQ State of AI in Business 2025 [PDF] report puts a sharp number on this. 95% of early AI pilots fail to produce measurable ROI, not because the technology is weak but because it is mismatched to the problems organisations are trying to solve. The pattern repeats itself in industries. Leaders get uneasy when they can’t tell if the output is right, teams are unsure whether dashboards can be trusted, and customers quickly lose patience when an interaction feels automated rather than supported. Anyone who has been locked out of their bank account while the automated recovery system insists their answers are wrong knows how quickly confidence evaporates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klarna remains the most publicised example of large-scale automation in action. The company has now halved its workforce since 2022 and says internal AI systems are performing the work of 853 full-time roles, up from 700 earlier this year. Revenues have risen 108%, while average employee compensation has increased 60%, funded in part by those operational gains. Yet the picture is more complicated. Klarna still reported a 95 million dollar quarterly loss, and its CEO has warned that further staff reductions are likely. It shows that automation alone does not create stability. Without accountability and structure, the experience breaks down long before the AI does. As Jason Roos, CEO of CCaaS provider Cirrus, puts it, “Any transformation that unsettles confidence, inside or outside the business, carries a cost you cannot ignore. it can leave you worse off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have already seen what happens when autonomy runs ahead of accountability. The UK’s Department for Work and Pensions used an algorithm that wrongly flagged around 200,000 housing-benefit claims as potentially fraudulent, even though the majority were legitimate. The problem wasn’t the technology. It was the absence of clear ownership over its decisions. When an automated system suspends the wrong account, rejects the wrong claim or creates unnecessary fear, the issue is never just “why did the model misfire?” It’s “who owns the outcome?” Without that answer, trust becomes fragile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The missing step is always readiness,” says Roos. “If the process, the data and the guardrails aren’t in place, autonomy doesn’t accelerate performance, it amplifies the weaknesses. Accountability has to come first. Start with the outcome, find where effort is being wasted, check your readiness and governance, and only then automate. Skip those steps and accountability disappears just as fast as the efficiency gains arrive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is an obsession with scale without the grounding that makes scale sustainable. Many organisations push toward autonomous agents that can act decisively, yet very few pause to consider what happens when those actions drift outside expected boundaries. The Edelman Trust Barometer [PDF] shows a steady decline in public trust in AI over the past five years, and a joint KPMG and University of Melbourne study found that workers prefer more human involvement in almost half the tasks examined. The findings reinforce a simple point. Trust rarely comes from pushing models harder. It comes from people taking the time to understand how decisions are made, and from governance that behaves less like a brake pedal and more like a steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same dynamics appear on the customer side. PwC’s trust research reveals a wide gulf between perception and reality. Most executives believe customers trust their organisation, while only a minority of customers agree. Other surveys show that transparency helps to close this gap, with large majorities of consumers wanting clear disclosure when AI is used in service experiences. Without that clarity, people do not feel reassured. They feel misled, and the relationship becomes strained. Companies that communicate openly about their AI use are not only protecting trust but also normalising the idea that technology and human support can co-exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the confusion stems from the term “agentic AI” itself. Much of the market treats it as something unpredictable or self-directing, when in reality it is workflow automation with reasoning and recall. It is a structured way for systems to make modest decisions inside parameters designed by people. The deployments that scale safely all follow the same sequence. They start with the outcome they want to improve, then look at where unnecessary effort sits in the workflow, then assess whether their systems and teams are ready for autonomy, and only then choose the technology. Reversing that order does not speed anything up. It simply creates faster mistakes. As Roos says, AI should expand human judgement, not replace it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this points toward a wider truth. Every wave of automation eventually becomes a social question rather than a purely technical one. Amazon built its dominance through operational consistency, but it also built a level of confidence that the parcel would arrive. When that confidence dips, customers move on. AI follows the same pattern. You can deploy sophisticated, self-correcting systems, but if the customer feels tricked or misled at any point, the trust breaks. Internally, the same pressures apply. The KPMG global study [PDF] highlights how quickly employees disengage when they do not understand how decisions are made or who is accountable for them. Without that clarity, adoption stalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As agentic systems take on more conversational roles, the emotional dimension becomes even more significant. Early reviews of autonomous chat interactions show that people now judge their experience not only by whether they were helped but also by whether the interaction felt attentive and respectful. A customer who feels dismissed rarely keeps the frustration to themselves. The emotional tone of AI is becoming a genuine operational factor, and systems that cannot meet that expectation risk becoming liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difficult truth is that technology will continue to move faster than people’s instinctive comfort with it. Trust will always lag behind innovation. That is not an argument against progress. It is an argument for maturity. Every AI leader should be asking whether they would trust the system with their own data, whether they can explain its last decision in plain language, and who steps in when something goes wrong. If those answers are unclear, the organisation is not leading transformation. It is preparing an apology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roos puts it simply, “Agentic AI is not the concern. Unaccountable AI is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When trust goes, adoption goes, and the project that looked transformative becomes another entry in the 95% failure rate. Autonomy is not the enemy. Forgetting who is responsible is. The organisations that keep a human hand on the wheel will be the ones still in control when the self-driving hype eventually fades.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Woo-article.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have ever taken a self-driving Uber through downtown LA, you might recognise the strange sense of uncertainty that settles in when there is no driver and no conversation, just a quiet car making assumptions about the world around it.

The advancements offer new capabilities for legal professionals, enhancing the strategic approach lawyers take in managing cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration of AI and legal tech into personal injury law is changing how legal practices operate in Philadelphia. By using advanced technologies, like predictive analytics, law firms can gain valuable insights that were previously unattainable. The innovation aids in case management and empowers attorneys to strategize more effectively. As a Grays Ferry, Philadelphia personal injury lawyer adapts to these changes, you can expect a more data-driven approach to legal proceedings, using AI’s potential in predicting case outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-s-impact-on-personal-injury-law-practices"&gt;AI’s impact on personal injury law practices&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in various industries, and personal injury law is no exception. The incorporation of AI technologies allows for more efficient and precise handling of cases. With AI-driven tools, lawyers can analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately. The capability facilitates better decision-making processes and enables legal professionals to offer more tailored services to their clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictive analytics, a key application of AI, plays a crucial role in this transformation. By processing historical data and identifying patterns, predictive analytics can forecast potential case outcomes with remarkable accuracy. This enables lawyers to assess risks and develop strategies informed by empirical evidence rather than intuition alone. As the field continues to evolve, the reliance on data-driven insights will likely become an integral part of legal practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-predictive-analytics"&gt;Understanding predictive analytics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictive analytics involves analyzing current and historical data to predict future outcomes. In legal practices, this means using data from past cases to anticipate how similar cases might unfold. By examining factors like case details, precedents, and court rulings, AI can generate predictions that guide lawyers in making informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The types of data used in predictive analytics range from demographic information to historical court records. Advanced algorithms process this information to identify trends and correlations that may not be immediately apparent to human analysts. Through this process, lawyers gain insights that enhance their understanding of complex legal scenarios, ultimately improving their ability to advocate for their clients effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-applications-in-managing-personal-injury-cases"&gt;Applications in managing personal injury cases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In personal injury cases, predictive analytics serves as a tool for risk assessment and strategy development. Lawyers can use these insights to estimate the likelihood of winning a case or securing a favorable settlement.

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, people are taking Grok at its word, treating the chatbot as a company spokesperson without questioning what it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday morning, many outlets reported that X had blocked universal access to Grok’s image-editing features after the chatbot began prompting some users to pay $8 to use them. The messages are seemingly in response to reporting that people are using Grok to generate thousands of non-consensual sexualized images of women and children each hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers,” Grok tells users, dropping a link and urging, “you can subscribe to unlock these features.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as The Verge pointed out and Ars verified, unsubscribed X users can still use Grok to edit images. X seems to have limited users’ ability to request edits made by replying to Grok while still allowing image edits through the desktop site. App users can access the same feature by long-pressing on any image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using image-editing features without publicly prompting Grok keeps outputs out of the public feed. That means the only issue X has rushed to solve is stopping Grok from directly posting harmful images on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X declined to comment on whether it’s working to close those loopholes, but it has a history of pushing janky updates since Elon Musk took over the platform formerly known as Twitter. Still, motivated X users can also continue using the standalone Grok app or website to make abusive content for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like images X users can edit without publicly asking Grok, these images aren’t posted publicly to an official X account but are likely to be shared by bad actors—some of whom, according to the BBC, are already promoting allegedly Grok-generated child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) on the dark web. That’s especially concerning since Wired reported this week that users of the Grok app and website are generating far more graphic and disturbing images than what X users are creating.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;X risks fines if UK rejects supposed fix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how charging for Grok image editing will block controversial outputs, as Grok’s problematic safety guidelines remain intact. The chatbot is still instructed to assume that users have “good intent” when requesting images of “teenage” girls, which xAI says “does not necessarily imply underage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could lead to Grok continuing to post harmful images of minors. xAI’s other priorities include Grok directives to avoid moralizing users and to place “no restrictions” on “fictional adult sexual content with dark or violent themes.” An AI safety expert told Ars that Grok could be tweaked to be safer, describing the chatbot’s safety guidelines as the kind of policy a platform would design if it “wanted to look safe while still allowing a lot under the hood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updates to Grok’s X responses came after the platform risked fines and legal action from regulators around the world, including a potential ban in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X seems to hope that forcing users to share identification and credit card information as paying subscribers will make them less likely to use Grok to generate illegal content. But advocates who combat image-based sex abuse note that content like Grok’s “undressing” outputs can cause lasting psychological, financial, and reputational harm, even if the content is not illegal in some states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That suggests that paying subscribers could continue using Grok to create harmful images that X may leave unchecked because they’re not technically illegal. In 2024, X agreed to voluntarily moderate all non-consensual intimate images, but Musk’s promotion of revealing bikini images of public and private figures suggests that’s no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems likely that Grok will continue to be used to create non-consensual intimate images. So rather than solve the problem, X may at best succeed in limiting public exposure to Grok’s appalling outputs. The company may even profit from the feature, as Wired reported that Grok pushed “nudifying” or “undressing” apps into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, US regulators have been quiet about Grok’s outputs, with the Justice Department generally promising to take all forms of CSAM seriously. On Friday, Democratic senators started shifting those tides, demanding that Google and Apple remove X and Grok from app stores until it improves safeguards to block harmful outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There can be no mistake about X’s knowledge, and, at best, negligent response to these trends,” the senators wrote in a letter to Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai. “Turning a blind eye to X’s egregious behavior would make a mockery of your moderation practices. Indeed, not taking action would undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A response to the letter is requested by January 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the UK will accept X’s supposed solution is yet to be seen. If UK regulator Ofcom decides to move ahead with a probe into whether Musk’s chatbot violates the UK’s Online Safety Act, X could face a UK ban or fines of up to 10 percent of the company’s global turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s unlawful,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said of Grok’s worst outputs. “We’re not going to tolerate it. I’ve asked for all options to be on the table. It’s disgusting. X need to get their act together and get this material down. We will take action on this because it’s simply not tolerable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one UK parliament member, Jess Asato, told The Guardian that even if X had put up an actual paywall, that isn’t enough to end the scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While it is a step forward to have removed the universal access to Grok’s disgusting nudifying features, this still means paying users can take images of women without their consent to sexualise and brutalise them,” Asato said. “Paying to put semen, bullet holes, or bikinis on women is still digital sexual assault, and xAI should disable the feature for good.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the UK will accept X’s supposed solution is yet to be seen. If UK regulator Ofcom decides to move ahead with a probe into whether Musk’s chatbot violates the UK’s Online Safety Act, X could face a UK ban or fines of up to 10 percent of the company’s global turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s unlawful,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said of Grok’s worst outputs. “We’re not going to tolerate it. I’ve asked for all options to be on the table. It’s disgusting. X need to get their act together and get this material down. We will take action on this because it’s simply not tolerable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one UK parliament member, Jess Asato, told The Guardian that even if X had put up an actual paywall, that isn’t enough to end the scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While it is a step forward to have removed the universal access to Grok’s disgusting nudifying features, this still means paying users can take images of women without their consent to sexualise and brutalise them,” Asato said. “Paying to put semen, bullet holes, or bikinis on women is still digital sexual assault, and xAI should disable the feature for good.”&lt;/p&gt;

Datadog, a company responsible for the observability of complex infrastructures worldwide, operates under intense pressure to maintain this balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a client’s systems fail, they rely on Datadog’s platform to diagnose the root cause—meaning reliability must be established well &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; software reaches a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaling this reliability is an operational challenge. Code review has traditionally acted as the primary gatekeeper, a high-stakes phase where senior engineers attempt to catch errors. However, as teams expand, relying on human reviewers to maintain deep contextual knowledge of the entire codebase becomes unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this bottleneck, Datadog’s AI Development Experience (AI DevX) team integrated OpenAI’s Codex, aiming to automate the detection of risks that human reviewers frequently miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-static-analysis-falls-short"&gt;Why static analysis falls short&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enterprise market has long utilised automated tools to assist in code review, but their effectiveness has historically been limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early iterations of AI code review tools often performed like “advanced linters,” identifying superficial syntax issues but failing to grasp the broader system architecture. Because these tools lacked the ability to understand context, engineers at Datadog frequently dismissed their suggestions as noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core issue was not detecting errors in isolation, but understanding how a specific change might ripple through interconnected systems. Datadog required a solution capable of reasoning over the codebase and its dependencies, rather than simply scanning for style violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team integrated the new agent directly into the workflow of one of their most active repositories, allowing it to review every pull request automatically. Unlike static analysis tools, this system compares the developer’s intent with the actual code submission, executing tests to validate behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CTOs and CIOs, the difficulty in adopting generative AI often lies in proving its value beyond theoretical efficiency. Datadog bypassed standard productivity metrics by creating an “incident replay harness” to test the tool against historical outages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on hypothetical test cases, the team reconstructed past pull requests that were known to have caused incidents. They then ran the AI agent against these specific changes to determine if it would have flagged the issues that humans missed in their code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results provided a concrete data point for risk mitigation: the agent identified over 10 cases (approximately 22% of the examined incidents) where its feedback would have prevented the error. These were pull requests that had already bypassed human review, demonstrating that the AI surfaced risks invisible to the engineers at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This validation changed the internal conversation regarding the tool’s utility. Brad Carter, who leads the AI DevX team, noted that while efficiency gains are welcome, “preventing incidents is far more compelling at our scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ai-code-reviews-are-changing-engineering-culture"&gt;How AI code reviews are changing engineering culture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deployment of this technology to more than 1,000 engineers has influenced the culture of code review within the organisation. Rather than replacing the human element, the AI serves as a partner that handles the cognitive load of cross-service interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers reported that the system consistently flagged issues that were not obvious from the immediate code difference. It identified missing test coverage in areas of cross-service coupling and pointed out interactions with modules that the developer had not touched directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This depth of analysis changed how the engineering staff interacted with automated feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, a Codex comment feels like the smartest engineer I’ve worked with and who has infinite time to find bugs. It sees connections my brain doesn’t hold all at once,” explains Carter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI code review system’s ability to contextualise changes allows human reviewers to shift their focus from catching bugs to evaluating architecture and design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-bug-hunting-to-reliability"&gt;From bug hunting to reliability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders, the Datadog case study illustrates a transition in how code review is defined. It is no longer viewed merely as a checkpoint for error detection or a metric for cycle time, but as a core reliability system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By surfacing risks that exceed individual context, the technology supports a strategy where confidence in shipping code scales alongside the team. This aligns with the priorities of Datadog’s leadership, who view reliability as a fundamental component of customer trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are the platform companies rely on when everything else is breaking,” says Carter. “Preventing incidents strengthens the trust our customers place in us”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The successful integration of AI into the code review pipeline suggests that the technology’s highest value in the enterprise may lie in its ability to enforce complex quality standards that protect the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentic AI scaling requires new memory architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111551" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-2.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Oklo and TerraPower, two companies developing small modular reactors (SMR), each signed agreements with Meta to build multiple reactors, while Vistra is selling capacity from its existing power plants.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nuclear power has become a favored power source for tech companies as their AI ambitions have grown, providing stable 24/7 electricity. Startups and existing reactors have benefited from the race for data center power, though in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Existing reactors tend to be the cheapest form of baseload capacity, but there are only so many to go around, which has pushed Meta and its peers toward SMR startups. Companies like Oklo and TerraPower are betting that by building a large number of smaller reactors, they’ll be able to bring the cost down through mass manufacturing. It’s a plausible hypothesis, though one that has yet to be tested. Meta’s deal could give SMR startups a chance to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deals are the result of a request for proposals that Meta issued in December 2024, in which Meta sought partners that could add between 1 to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity by the early 2030s. Much of the new power will flow through the PJM interconnection, a grid which covers 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states and has become saturated with data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 20-year agreement with Vistra will have the most immediate impact on Meta’s energy needs. The tech company will buy a total of 2.1 gigawatts from two existing nuclear power plants, Perry and Davis-Besse in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the deal, Vistra will also add capacity to those power plants and to its Beaver Valley power plant in Pennsylvania. Together, the upgrades will generate an additional 433 MW and are scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta is also buying 1.2 gigawatts from young provider Oklo. Under its deal with Meta, Oklo is hoping to start supplying power to the grid as early as 2030. The SMR company went public via SPAC in 2023, and while Oklo has landed a large deal with data center operator Switch, it has struggled to get its reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Oklo can deliver on its timeline, the new reactors would be built in Pike County, Ohio. The startup’s Aurora Powerhouse reactors each produce 75 megawatts of electricity, and it will need to build more than a dozen to fulfill Meta’s order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TerraPower is a startup co-founded by Bill Gates, and it is aiming to start sending electricity to Meta as early as 2032. It has designed a reactor that uses molten sodium to transfer energy from reactor to generator. When demand is low, the superheated salt can be stored in an insulated vat until more power is needed. The reactor can generate 345 megawatts of electricity, while the storage system can provide an additional 100 to 500 megawatts for more than five hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has navigated the NRC process more smoothly, and it is working with GE Hitachi to build its first power plant in Wyoming. Its first two reactors for Meta would provide 690 megawatts, and Meta said it has rights to buy another six units for a total of 2.8 gigawatts of nuclear capacity and 1.2 gigawatts of storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta did not disclose financial terms of the deals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The power purchases from Vistra are certain to be the cheapest — electricity from already operating nuclear reactors is among the cheapest on the grid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Costs for SMRs still have yet to be worked out. Several startups have aggressive cost targets: TerraPower has estimated that it can bring it down to $50 to $60 per megawatt-hour, while Oklo has said it is aiming for $80 to $130 per megawatt-hour. Those figures are for later power plants — the first examples are likely to cost more.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-129268875.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta today announced three deals to provide its data centers with nuclear power: one from a startup, one from a smaller energy company, and one from a larger company that already operates several nuclear reactors in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;CES 2026 is over and we’re outta here. You should still expect more articles over the coming days that relate back to who we spoke to and what we saw at CES. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This was the year of “physical AI,” in which companies showed off consumer gadgets, robots, and vehicles that put AI front and center. To pull off physical AI, you gotta have compute. And so it certainly made sense that the two keynotes packed with arguably the most news were from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and AMD CEO Lisa Su. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Robots, and specifically humanoid robots also took center stage, including on the deal flow side of things. Hyundai, which is the majority owner of Boston Dynamics, had an exhibit filled with robots, including its humanoid Atlas. (The line to get into the Hyundai exhibit was never absent, illustrating the interest in robots.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, as transportation editor I would be remiss not to comment on cars. CES is no longer a U.S. and European car show, a status it enjoyed for about a decade until last year. But that doesn’t mean vehicles were absent. Several Chinese automakers had exhibits, including Geely Holding, even though vehicles from this region cannot be sold in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There were plenty of transportation-related announcements and displays — even if they weren’t of the passenger car or truck variety. Autonomous vehicle technology was everywhere,  lidar companies, startups hawking automated driving software, to industrial applications of the tech, and of course, robotaxis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Waymo and Zoox both had booths showcasing their respective robotaxis — and the crowds were consistent and large.  Will more robotaxi operators set up shop in the Las Vegas Convention Center next year? My guess is yes and I have a few ideas of which ones will be there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;CES 2026 is over and we’re outta here. You should still expect more articles over the coming days that relate back to who we spoke to and what we saw at CES. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This was the year of “physical AI,” in which companies showed off consumer gadgets, robots, and vehicles that put AI front and center. To pull off physical AI, you gotta have compute. And so it certainly made sense that the two keynotes packed with arguably the most news were from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and AMD CEO Lisa Su. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Robots, and specifically humanoid robots also took center stage, including on the deal flow side of things. Hyundai, which is the majority owner of Boston Dynamics, had an exhibit filled with robots, including its humanoid Atlas.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s plan began to take shape last month with the announcement of a partnership between Ozlo and meditation app Calm. But it kicked into high gear at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week as the company met with prospective partners to expand its reach.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those new partners could help Ozlo tap into new audiences and build a revenue model beyond consumer-focused hardware and into the profit-margin-rich world of software subscriptions and healthcare. For instance, software features that use AI or are designed to provide relief to users with tinnitus could be offered as premium subscriptions. And a recent acquisition of a neurotech startup should help Ozlo expand beyond being a consumer product to entering the medical device market, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ozlo-s-platform-ambitions-began"&gt;How Ozlo’s platform ambitions began&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081455" height="382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ozlo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded by former Bose employees, Ozlo always intended to build an ecosystem, Ozlo co-founder and CEO NB Patil explained on the sidelines of CES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The way we did that from the beginning is we built the iOS and Android SDK — so our first-party app actually runs on that SDK. That means whatever you see in our app can be made available to anybody,” Patil said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The mental wellness company Calm, for instance, is using the SDK to tell whether its sleep and meditation content is actually resonating with its customers. While Calm can’t tell from its own app if customers have fallen asleep, Ozlo’s sensors can. The device detects how body movements and respiration rates change, and that data is sent to the Ozlo charging case. There, a machine learning algorithm determines whether someone is asleep or is relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ozlo’s smart case has other sensors as well, including a temperature sensor and a light sensor that can add more data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, that information can be shared with apps like Calm and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081456" height="293" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ozlo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, if a user started playing a breathing exercise, Ozlo could tell if their respiration rate had gone down and share that data with its partner. If the exercise is unsuccessful, the partner would know they need to change the pattern or do something different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“So there are two parts,” Patil notes. “Taking real-time action when the customer achieves the desired state [which Ozlo does with its feature that can shut off sounds after the user falls asleep] and the other part, which is very important, actually — that content creators are not quite thinking about — is, are they investing in the right content?” &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Patil explains that content creators for these types of meditation and sleeping aid apps tend to invest in volume without measuring whether or not their content is effective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“They don’t understand, actually, how it works in the field because there is no data,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081511" height="439" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/imgi_5_BH-ANNIE_SELECT_still_export_0040-Edit_1.jpg" width="600" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ozlo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This relationship could also add another revenue stream to Ozlo’s business beyond selling hardware. For instance, if a customer is prompted to upgrade their subscription to the partner’s product, Ozlo could take a portion of that transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Patil told TechCrunch the company is already in discussions with other sleep and meditation apps, but this closed-loop feedback system could be used with any sort of content, including therapy or even audiobooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ozlo is also working on tinnitus therapy tools to address the ear-ringing problem that affects 15% of its customer base. The company teamed up with Walter Reed Hospital last year to launch a clinical study of the problem and found that playing the right masking frequency overnight for many weeks can fool the brain into stopping the irritating signals producing the ringing sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Patil says the tinnitus therapies will be available via a subscription and will roll out in the second quarter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-ai-to-help-you-sleep-better"&gt;An AI to help you sleep better &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081454" height="551" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ozlo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ozlo is also working to expand the insights it provides its own customers, and AI is an increasingly important piece. The company launched Sleep Patterns within its app in November to help customers understand how long and well they’ve slept, what their patterns are across the past weeks, and what factors could be disturbing their rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This year, Ozlo plans to introduce an AI agent that customers can text with and use as a “sleep buddy.” (The company revealed the “buddy” name for its AI agent in an Easter egg within the app. The app displays an animated character — “buddy” — that runs across the top of the screen when you open and close the case five times in a row.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By integrating with other wearables and Apple’s HealthKit, Ozlo will be able to better understand a user’s patterns and what they need to sleep better. It also wants to be able to connect with IoT devices, like smart thermostats, to set the right sleeping temperature for users as soon as they open the case at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI features are expected in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-hardware-eeg-insights-on-the-way"&gt;New hardware, EEG insights on the way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ozlo’s next-generation case will address the issue of the earbuds sometimes not being properly seated in the charger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We changed the contours inside the case — when you place [the sleepbud], it’s perfect. And then we’ll have a Bluetooth button to do the pairing,” Patil says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, the new device will include a redesigned antenna and extender for improved range, and will add an amplifier to boost how loud the headphones can be to drown out plane and train noise, when needed. This updated hardware will also arrive in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In terms of products, Ozlo will launch a bedside speaker in Q2 that will offer similar functionality to the Sleepbuds, but won’t need to go in the ear. A 4×6-inch speaker would also have its own sensor, allowing it to do things like tracking how many times you woke up for bathroom breaks, or alert others if you had fallen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The speaker would allow the company to market to families with children under 13, as kids aren’t advised to wear earbuds at night. It could also make sense for elderly individuals who aren’t as technically savvy and don’t want to fiddle with in-ear devices.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like the popular Hatch alarm clock, Ozlo is working on adding a light to a product in the future to gently wake you up. (The time frame to launch is still being determined.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081458" height="386" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-12.26.39-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Segotia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-acquisition-play"&gt;The acquisition play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Acquisitions are also part of Ozlo’s growth strategy. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 60-person, Boston-based company just acquired Segotia, an EEG-focused neurotech firm from Ireland, that has been building “hearable” technologies. Ozlo believes this will allow it to bring brain-level insights to its consumer device and later develop tools to do real-time sleep intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Basically, we are custom designing the eartip that is going to measure the electrical signals from your ear. From that, actually, you can derive the delta signals from the brain, and you should be able to say what your brain is doing when it comes to sleep, or when it comes to awareness, and all that,” Patil explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A product incorporating the EEG technology will launch in 2027, allowing the company to move into the medical products field, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the busy year ahead, Ozlo will need to execute well on each new feature and product in rapid order to maintain its current pace and grow its customer base. It will also need additional capital. Patil told TechCrunch the company is in the process of closing a Series B round now, with more details to come in the month ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Ozlo, the maker of comfortable, easy-to-use Sleepbuds that drown out outside noise so you can get better rest, is turning its product into a platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI features are expected in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-hardware-eeg-insights-on-the-way"&gt;New hardware, EEG insights on the way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ozlo’s next-generation case will address the issue of the earbuds sometimes not being properly seated in the charger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We changed the contours inside the case — when you place [the sleepbud], it’s perfect. And then we’ll have a Bluetooth button to do the pairing,” Patil says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, the new device will include a redesigned antenna and extender for improved range, and will add an amplifier to boost how loud the headphones can be to drown out plane and train noise, when needed. This updated hardware will also arrive in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In terms of products, Ozlo will launch a bedside speaker in Q2 that will offer similar functionality to the Sleepbuds, but won’t need to go in the ear. A 4×6-inch speaker would also have its own sensor, allowing it to do things like tracking how many times you woke up for bathroom breaks, or alert others if you had fallen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The speaker would allow the company to market to families with children under 13, as kids aren’t advised to wear earbuds at night. It could also make sense for elderly individuals who aren’t as technically savvy and don’t want to fiddle with in-ear devices.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like the popular Hatch alarm clock, Ozlo is working on adding a light to a product in the future to gently wake you up. (The time frame to launch is still being determined.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081458" height="386" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-12.26.39-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Segotia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-acquisition-play"&gt;The acquisition play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Acquisitions are also part of Ozlo’s growth strategy. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 60-person, Boston-based company just acquired Segotia, an EEG-focused neurotech firm from Ireland, that has been building “hearable” technologies. Ozlo believes this will allow it to bring brain-level insights to its consumer device and later develop tools to do real-time sleep intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Basically, we are custom designing the eartip that is going to measure the electrical signals from your ear. From that, actually, you can derive the delta signals from the brain, and you should be able to say what your brain is doing when it comes to sleep, or when it comes to awareness, and all that,” Patil explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A product incorporating the EEG technology will launch in 2027, allowing the company to move into the medical products field, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the busy year ahead, Ozlo will need to execute well on each new feature and product in rapid order to maintain its current pace and grow its customer base. It will also need additional capital. Patil told TechCrunch the company is in the process of closing a Series B round now, with more details to come in the month ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/how-the-sleepbuds-maker-ozlo-is-building-a-platform-for-sleep-data/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 19:36:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Google: Don’t make “bite-sized” content for LLMs if you care about search rank (AI - Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-dont-make-bite-sized-content-for-llms-if-you-care-about-search-rank/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Search engine optimization, or SEO, is a big business. While some SEO practices are useful, much of the day-to-day SEO wisdom you see online amounts to superstition. An increasingly popular approach geared toward LLMs called “content chunking” may fall into that category. In the latest installment of Google’s &lt;em&gt;Search Off the Record&lt;/em&gt; podcast, John Mueller and Danny Sullivan say that breaking content down into bite-sized chunks for LLMs like Gemini is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably seen websites engaging in content chunking and scratched your head, and for good reason—this content isn’t made for you. The idea is that if you split information into smaller paragraphs and sections, it is more likely to be ingested and cited by generative AI bots like Gemini. So you end up with short paragraphs, sometimes with just one or two sentences, and lots of subheds formatted like questions one might ask a chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sullivan, this is a misconception, and Google doesn’t use such signals to improve ranking. “One of the things I keep seeing over and over in some of the advice and guidance and people are trying to figure out what do we do with the LLMs or whatever, is that turn your content into bite-sized chunks, because LLMs like things that are really bite size, right?” said Sullivan. “So… we don’t want you to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation, which begins around the podcast’s 18-minute mark, illustrates the folly of jumping on the latest SEO trend. Sullivan notes that he has consulted engineers at Google before making this proclamation. Apparently, the best way to rank on Google continues to be creating content for humans rather than machines. That ensures long-term search exposure, because the behavior of human beings—what they choose to click on—is an important signal for Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google only provides general SEO recommendations, leaving the Internet’s SEO experts to cast bones and read tea leaves to gauge how the search algorithm works. This approach has borne fruit in the past, but not every SEO suggestion is a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumultuous current state of the Internet, defined by inconsistent traffic and rapidly expanding use of AI, may entice struggling publishers to try more SEO snake oil like content chunking. When traffic is scarce, people will watch for any uptick and attribute that to the changes they have made. When the opposite happens, well, it’s just a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new content superstition may appear to work at first, but at best, that’s an artifact of Google’s current quirks—the company isn’t building LLMs to like split-up content. Sullivan admits there may be “edge cases” where content chunking appears to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Great. That’s what’s happening now, but tomorrow the systems may change,” he said. “You’ve made all these things that you did specifically for a ranking system, not for a human being because you were trying to be more successful in the ranking system, not staying focused on the human being. And then the systems improve, probably the way the systems always try to improve, to reward content written for humans. All that stuff that you did to please this LLM system that may or may not have worked, may not carry through for the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We probably won’t see chunking go away as long as publishers can point to a positive effect. However, Google seems to feel that chopping up content for LLMs is not a viable future for SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As has been the case for the past two years, AI&amp;nbsp;was&amp;nbsp;at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware&amp;nbsp;upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements.&amp;nbsp;This year, physical AI was particularly prominent, taking the&amp;nbsp;place&amp;nbsp;that agentic AI held&amp;nbsp;last year as the show’s buzzy topic.&amp;nbsp;That focus on physical AI came alongside a big focus on robotics, with robots&amp;nbsp;demonstrated&amp;nbsp;all over the show and&amp;nbsp;showcased&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;numerous&amp;nbsp;press events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To&amp;nbsp;relive&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground, you can go back in time&amp;nbsp;via our live blog right here.&amp;nbsp;Otherwise,&amp;nbsp;let’s&amp;nbsp;dive into some of the biggest and most notable announcements from&amp;nbsp;CES.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If audio or video are&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;your thing, then&amp;nbsp;head right to the latest episode of our Equity podcast, which goes into detail about what we thought about the show, or watch the full episode below on YouTube.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-reveals-ai-model-for-autonomous-vehicles-showcases-rubin-architecture"&gt;Nvidia reveals AI model for autonomous vehicles, showcases Rubin architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes,&amp;nbsp;setting the stage for 2026, and yes,&amp;nbsp;hanging out with some robots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Rubin computing&amp;nbsp;architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is&amp;nbsp;set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our&amp;nbsp;senior AI&amp;nbsp;editor&amp;nbsp;Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world,&amp;nbsp;showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models&amp;nbsp;and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year.&amp;nbsp;That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amd-s-keynote-highlights-new-processors-and-partnerships-nbsp"&gt;AMD’s keynote highlights new processors and partnerships&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li,&amp;nbsp;Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond the&amp;nbsp;partner&amp;nbsp;showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak&amp;nbsp;detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers&amp;nbsp;using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-standout-oddities-of-ces"&gt;The standout oddities of CES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Let’s&amp;nbsp;face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES.&amp;nbsp;We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but&amp;nbsp;we’re&amp;nbsp;open to more suggestions!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-highlights-from-ces-breakout-sessions"&gt;Highlights from CES breakout sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CES&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;all hardware&amp;nbsp;showcases&amp;nbsp;and show floor attractions — there are plenty of&amp;nbsp;additional&amp;nbsp;industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We&amp;nbsp;kept tabs on&amp;nbsp;a few notable highlights, ranging from&amp;nbsp;Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the&amp;nbsp;“learn once, work forever” era may be over,&amp;nbsp;to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,”&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service,&amp;nbsp;to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ford-s-ai-assistant-debuts"&gt;Ford’s AI assistant debuts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ford is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As&amp;nbsp;we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the&amp;nbsp;assistant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caterpillar-nvidia-partner-on-automated-construction-equipment"&gt;Caterpillar, Nvidia partner on automated construction equipment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world,&amp;nbsp;Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was&amp;nbsp;demonstrated&amp;nbsp;at CES Wednesday.&amp;nbsp;This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hands-on-with-clicks-communicator"&gt;Hands-on with Clicks Communicator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="display of Clicks smartphones" class="wp-image-3081105" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0669-2.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Check out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lg-s-home-robot-cloid-nbsp-makes-a-sluggish-first-impression"&gt;LG’s home robot CLOiD&amp;nbsp;makes a sluggish first impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081245" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LG-Robt-at-CES-2026.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A big part of LG’s CES presentation was dedicated to its robotics efforts, with home robot CLOiD as a prominent figurehead. And how did the robot fare once it was off the press conference stage and out in the wild?&amp;nbsp;We’ll&amp;nbsp;let Senior Writer Lucas Ropek’s impressions speak for themselves:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOiD&amp;nbsp;didn’t&amp;nbsp;do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in&amp;nbsp;a number of&amp;nbsp;hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eufymake-uv-printer-is-an-etsy-maker-s-dream"&gt;eufyMake&amp;nbsp;UV printer is an Etsy maker’s dream&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Long used in industrial settings, UV printers that can print ink directly onto objects have been prohibitively expensive for individuals to own. But the&amp;nbsp;eufyMake&amp;nbsp;E1&amp;nbsp;is set to launch for $2,299 later this year, which makes bulk printing on things like mugs, water&amp;nbsp;bottles,&amp;nbsp;and phone cases a bit more attainable for individuals.&amp;nbsp;Lucas Ropek has more first impressions here.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-way-to-find-and-nbsp-purchase-nbsp-office-space"&gt;A new way to find and&amp;nbsp;purchase&amp;nbsp;office space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MyCommuters&amp;nbsp;has a novel take on creating office space by helping companies find locations that are beneficial to them and their employees. The platform pulls together different datasets to examine commute time, expenses, and other&amp;nbsp;factors to&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp;an ideal spot for an office, not just the easiest thing to spot that’s on the market.&amp;nbsp;Sean O’Kane&amp;nbsp;has more reporting on the idea that drove founder Guillaume Acier to start the company here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This family planning tool caught our eye on the show floor, not just for its calendar and planning capabilities, but for its AI capabilities that are able to&amp;nbsp;sync&amp;nbsp;calendars from&amp;nbsp;different sources; create new to-dos based&amp;nbsp;off of&amp;nbsp;messages or photos, appointment reminders; and more.&amp;nbsp;Check out our full impressions here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-boston-dynamics-and-google-partner-on-atlas-robots-nbsp"&gt;Boston Dynamics and Google partner on Atlas robots&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that&amp;nbsp;they’re&amp;nbsp;working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors&amp;nbsp;to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage.&amp;nbsp;Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push&amp;nbsp;you’d&amp;nbsp;expect at CES, with&amp;nbsp;the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers&amp;nbsp;looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on&amp;nbsp;Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new&amp;nbsp;Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta&amp;nbsp;runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and&amp;nbsp;more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-razer-joins-the-ai-deluge-nbsp-with-project-ava-and-motoko-nbsp"&gt;Razer joins the AI deluge&amp;nbsp;with Project AVA and Motoko&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES,&amp;nbsp;from three-screen laptops&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;haptic gaming cushions&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project&amp;nbsp;Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but&amp;nbsp;without&amp;nbsp;the glasses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk.&amp;nbsp;We’ll&amp;nbsp;let you watch the concept video for yourself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes&amp;nbsp;bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme. Senior writer Amanda&amp;nbsp;Silberling&amp;nbsp;has all the details here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Check out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lg-s-home-robot-cloid-nbsp-makes-a-sluggish-first-impression"&gt;LG’s home robot CLOiD&amp;nbsp;makes a sluggish first impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081245" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LG-Robt-at-CES-2026.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A big part of LG’s CES presentation was dedicated to its robotics efforts, with home robot CLOiD as a prominent figurehead. And how did the robot fare once it was off the press conference stage and out in the wild?&amp;nbsp;We’ll&amp;nbsp;let Senior Writer Lucas Ropek’s impressions speak for themselves:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOiD&amp;nbsp;didn’t&amp;nbsp;do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in&amp;nbsp;a number of&amp;nbsp;hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eufymake-uv-printer-is-an-etsy-maker-s-dream"&gt;eufyMake&amp;nbsp;UV printer is an Etsy maker’s dream&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Long used in industrial settings, UV printers that can print ink directly onto objects have been prohibitively expensive for individuals to own. But the&amp;nbsp;eufyMake&amp;nbsp;E1&amp;nbsp;is set to launch for $2,299 later this year, which makes bulk printing on things like mugs, water&amp;nbsp;bottles,&amp;nbsp;and phone cases a bit more attainable for individuals.&amp;nbsp;Lucas Ropek has more first impressions here.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-way-to-find-and-nbsp-purchase-nbsp-office-space"&gt;A new way to find and&amp;nbsp;purchase&amp;nbsp;office space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MyCommuters&amp;nbsp;has a novel take on creating office space by helping companies find locations that are beneficial to them and their employees. The platform pulls together different datasets to examine commute time, expenses, and other&amp;nbsp;factors to&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp;an ideal spot for an office, not just the easiest thing to spot that’s on the market.&amp;nbsp;Sean O’Kane&amp;nbsp;has more reporting on the idea that drove founder Guillaume Acier to start the company here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This family planning tool caught our eye on the show floor, not just for its calendar and planning capabilities, but for its AI capabilities that are able to&amp;nbsp;sync&amp;nbsp;calendars from&amp;nbsp;different sources; create new to-dos based&amp;nbsp;off of&amp;nbsp;messages or photos, appointment reminders; and more.&amp;nbsp;Check out our full impressions here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-boston-dynamics-and-google-partner-on-atlas-robots-nbsp"&gt;Boston Dynamics and Google partner on Atlas robots&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that&amp;nbsp;they’re&amp;nbsp;working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors&amp;nbsp;to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage.&amp;nbsp;Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push&amp;nbsp;you’d&amp;nbsp;expect at CES, with&amp;nbsp;the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers&amp;nbsp;looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on&amp;nbsp;Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new&amp;nbsp;Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta&amp;nbsp;runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and&amp;nbsp;more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-razer-joins-the-ai-deluge-nbsp-with-project-ava-and-motoko-nbsp"&gt;Razer joins the AI deluge&amp;nbsp;with Project AVA and Motoko&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES,&amp;nbsp;from three-screen laptops&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;haptic gaming cushions&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project&amp;nbsp;Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but&amp;nbsp;without&amp;nbsp;the glasses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk.&amp;nbsp;We’ll&amp;nbsp;let you watch the concept video for yourself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes&amp;nbsp;bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme. Senior writer Amanda&amp;nbsp;Silberling&amp;nbsp;has all the details here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
