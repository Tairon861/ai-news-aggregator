It was meant to mark a leap toward the “artificial general intelligence” that tech’s evangelists have promised will transform humanity for the better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Against those expectations, the model has mostly underwhelmed.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People have highlighted glaring mistakes in GPT-5’s responses, countering Altman’s claim made at the launch that it works like “a legitimate PhD-level expert in anything any area you need on demand.” Early testers have also found issues with OpenAI’s promise that GPT-5 automatically works out what type of AI model is best suited for your question—a reasoning model for more complicated queries, or a faster model for simpler ones. Altman seems to have conceded that this feature is flawed and takes away user control. However there is good news too: the model seems to have eased the problem of ChatGPT sucking up to users, with GPT-5 less likely to shower them with over the top compliments.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Overall, as my colleague Grace Huckins pointed out, the new release represents more of a product update—providing slicker and prettier ways of conversing with ChatGPT—than a breakthrough that reshapes what is possible in AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there’s one other thing to take from all this. For a while, AI companies didn’t make much effort to suggest how their models might be used. Instead, the plan was to simply build the smartest model possible—a brain of sorts—and trust that it would be good at lots of things. Writing poetry would come as naturally as organic chemistry. Getting there would be accomplished by bigger models, better training techniques, and technical breakthroughs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That has been changing: The play now is to push existing models into more places by hyping up specific applications. Companies have been more aggressive in their promises that their AI models can replace human coders, for example (even if the early evidence suggests otherwise). A possible explanation for this pivot is that tech giants simply have not made the breakthroughs they’ve expected. We might be stuck with only marginal improvements in large language models’ capabilities for the time being. That leaves AI companies with one option: Work with what you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The starkest example of this in the launch of GPT-5 is how much OpenAI is encouraging people to use it for health advice, one of AI’s most fraught arenas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the beginning, OpenAI mostly didn’t play ball with medical questions. If you tried to ask ChatGPT about your health, it gave lots of disclaimers warning you that it was not a doctor, and for some questions, it would refuse to give a response at all. But as I recently reported, those disclaimers began disappearing as OpenAI released new models. Its models will now not only interpret x-rays and mammograms for you but ask follow-up questions leading toward a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In May, OpenAI signaled it would try to tackle medical questions head on.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It announced HealthBench, a way to evaluate how good AI systems are at handling health topics as measured against the opinions of physicians. In July, it published a study it participated in, reporting that a cohort of doctors in Kenya made fewer diagnostic mistakes when they were helped by an AI model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the launch of GPT-5, OpenAI has begun explicitly telling people to use its models for health advice. At the launch event, Altman welcomed on stage Felipe Millon, an OpenAI employee, and his wife, Carolina Millon, who had recently been diagnosed with multiple forms of cancer. Carolina spoke about asking ChatGPT for help with her diagnoses, saying that she had uploaded copies of her biopsy results to ChatGPT to translate medical jargon and asked the AI for help making decisions about things like whether or not to pursue radiation. The trio called it an empowering example of shrinking the knowledge gap between doctors and patients.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With this change in approach, OpenAI is wading into dangerous waters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For one, it’s using evidence that doctors can benefit from AI as a clinical tool, as in the Kenya study, to suggest that people without any medical background should ask the AI model for advice about their own health. The problem is that lots of people might ask for this advice without ever running it by a doctor (and are less likely to do so now that the chatbot rarely prompts them to).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Indeed, two days before the launch of GPT-5, the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; published a paper about a man who stopped eating salt and began ingesting dangerous amounts of bromide following a conversation with ChatGPT. He developed bromide poisoning—which largely disappeared in the US after the Food and Drug Administration began curbing the use of bromide in over-the-counter medications in the 1970s—and then nearly died, spending weeks in the hospital.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;So what’s the point of all this? Essentially, it’s about accountability. When AI companies move from promising general intelligence to offering humanlike helpfulness in a specific field like health care, it raises a second, yet unanswered question about what will happen when mistakes are made. As things stand, there’s little indication tech companies will be made liable for the harm caused.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When doctors give you harmful medical advice due to error or prejudicial bias, you can sue them for malpractice and get recompense,” says Damien Williams, an assistant professor of data science and philosophy at the University of North Carolina Charlotte.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When ChatGPT gives you harmful medical advice because it’s been trained on prejudicial data, or because ‘hallucinations’ are inherent in the operations of the system, what’s your recourse?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

Nvidia says they will offer higher performance and efficiency for AI, graphics, simulation, analytics, and industrial applications, and support tasks like AI model training, content creation, and scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI is reinventing computing for the first time in 60 years – what started in the cloud is now transforming the architecture of on-premises data centres,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With the world’s leading server providers, we’re making NVIDIA Blackwell RTX PRO Servers the standard platform for enterprise and industrial AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;GPU acceleration for business workloads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of servers are sold each year for business operations, most still using ‘traditional’ CPUs. The new RTX PRO Servers give systems GPU acceleration, boosting performance in analytics, simulations, video processing, and rendering, the company says. NVIDIA says its Server Edition GPU can deliver up to 45 times better performance than CPU-only systems, with 18 times higher energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RTX PRO line is aimed at companies building “AI factories” where space, power, and cooling may be limited. The servers also provide the infrastructure for NVIDIA’s AI Data Platform for storage systems. Dell, for example, is updating its AI Data Platform to use NVIDIA’s design; its PowerEdge R7725 servers comes with two RTX PRO 6000 GPUs, NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, and NVIDIA networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new 2U servers, which can house up to eight GPU units, were among those announced in May at COMPUTEX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blackwell architecture features&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new servers are built around NVIDIA’s Blackwell architecture, which includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fifth-generation Tensor Cores and a second-generation Transformer Engine with FP4 precision, capable of running inference at up to six times faster than the L40S GPU.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fourth-generation RTX technology for photo rendering, with up to four times the performance of the L40S GPU.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Virtualisation and NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU technology, allowing four separate workloads per GPU.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved energy efficiency for lower data centre power use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;For physical AI and robotics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s Omniverse libraries and Cosmos world foundation models on RTX PRO Servers can run digital twin simulations, robot training routines, and large-scale synthetic data creation. They also support NVIDIA Metropolis blueprints for video search and summarisation and vision language models, among other tools for use in physical environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s has updated its Omniverse and Cosmos offerings, with new Omniverse SDKs and added compatibility with MuJoCo (MJCF) and Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD). The company says this will allow over 250,000 MJCF developers to run robot simulations on its platforms. New Omniverse NuRec libraries bring ray-traced 3D Gaussian splatting for model construction from sensor data, while the updated Isaac Sim 5.0 and Isaac Lab 2.2 frameworks – available on GitHub – add neural rendering and new OpenUSD-based schemas for robots and sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NuRec rendering is already integrated into the CARLA autonomous vehicle simulator and is being adopted by companies like Foretellix, which is using it for generating synthetic AV testing data. Voxel51’s FiftyOne data engine, used by automakers like Ford and Porsche, now supports NuRec. Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Hexagon, and Amazon Devices &amp;amp; Services are among those already adopting the libraries and frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosmos WFMs has been downloaded over two million times. The software helps generate synthetic training data for robots using text, image, or video prompts. The new Cosmos Transfer-2 model speeds up image data generation from simulation scenes and spatial inputs like depth maps. Companies like Lightwheel, Moon Surgical, and Skild AI are using Cosmos have begun to produce training data at scale using Cosmos Transfer-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA has also introduced Cosmos Reason, a 7-billion-parameter vision language model to help robots and AI agents combine prior knowledge and understanding of physics. It can automate dataset curation, supports multi-step robot task planning, and run video analytics systems. NVIDIA’s own robotics and DRIVE teams use Cosmos Reason for data filtering and annotation, and Uber and Magna have deployed it in autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring, and industrial inspection systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI agents and large-scale deployments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RTX PRO Servers can run the newly-announced Llama Nemotron Super model. When running with NVFP4 precision on a single RTX PRO 6000 GPU, they deliver up to three times better price performance than FP8 on NVIDIA’s H100 GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Nvidia)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Nvidia reclaims title of most valuable company on AI momentum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

That’s what SoundHound AI is building.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the launch of Vision AI, SoundHound’s new system combines sight with sound to create a much smarter and more natural way to interact with technology. The idea is to mimic how we as humans operate; we don’t just listen to someone, we also see their gestures and what they’re looking at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing this same contextual understanding to AI, SoundHound hopes to smooth over the clunky and often frustrating experience we have with many of today’s smart devices. The company is targeting real-world applications where this combined sense could make a huge difference, whether that’s in your next car, at the restaurant drive-thru, or a factory floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyvan Mohajer, CEO of SoundHound AI, said: “At SoundHound, we believe the future of AI isn’t just multimodal—it’s deeply integrated, responsive, and built for real-world impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With Vision AI, we’re extending our leadership in voice and conversational AI to redefine how humans interact with products and services offered and used by businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how does it work? Vision AI takes a live feed from a camera and fuses it with the company’s voice technology, which already excels at understanding natural speech. By processing what it sees and what it hears at the exact same time, the system can grasp the user’s true intent in a way a simple voice assistant never could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of a mechanic wearing smart glasses who can simply look at an engine part and ask for instructions, receiving instant visual and audio guidance without ever putting down their tools. In a shop, a staff member could scan shelves just by looking at them to get a real-time inventory count. For the rest of us, it might mean a drive-thru kiosk that visually confirms our order on screen the moment we say it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest technical problems in creating such a system is ensuring the audio and visual elements are perfectly synchronised. Any lag would shatter the illusion of a natural conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pranav Singh, VP of Engineering at SoundHound AI, commented: “With Vision AI, we are fusing visual recognition and conversational intelligence into a single, synchronised flow. Every frame, every utterance, every intent is interpreted within the same ecosystem—ensuring faster, more natural user experiences that scale across surfaces from kiosks to embedded devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is innovation at the intersection of intelligence and execution, delivering AI that sees what you see, hears what you say, and responds in the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the businesses adopting this tech, the promise is to provide faster service, fewer mistakes, and happier customers. It’s about removing friction and making technology feel less like a tool you have to operate and more like a partner that helps you get things done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new visual capability isn’t the only upgrade SoundHound is rolling out. The company also recently improved the “brain” of its system with a new update, Amelia 7.1. This enhancement makes its AI agents faster, more accurate, and gives businesses more control and transparency over how they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining sight and sound, SoundHound is aiming to push us closer to a world where interacting with AI feels as easy and intuitive as talking to another person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Christian Lue)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alan Turing Institute: Humanities are key to the future of AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-11874" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

All that water and energy—and hints of elements essential for building organic molecules —point to another extraordinary possibility.

Its surface is a vast saltwater ocean, encased in a blanket of cracked ice, one that seems to occasionally break open and spew watery plumes into the moon’s thin atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, Europa captivates planetary scientists. All that water and energy—and hints of elements essential for building organic molecules —point to another extraordinary possibility. Jupiter’s big, bright moon could host life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may eventually get some answers thanks to Europa Clipper, scheduled to reach Jupiter in 2030.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That once-small research lab now employs more than 400 people, who have helped transform Nvidia from a video game GPU startup in the nineties to a $4 trillion-dollar company fueling the artificial intelligence boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the company’s research lab has its sights set on developing the tech needed to power robotics and AI. And some of that lab work is already showing up in products. The company unveiled Monday a new set of world AI models, libraries, and other infrastructure for robotics developers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Dally, now Nvidia’s chief scientist, started consulting for Nvidia in 2003 while he was working at Stanford. When he was ready to step down from being the department chair of Stanford’s computer science department a few years later, he planned to take a sabbatical. Nvidia had a different idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036045" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/NEW-Bill-Dally.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Bill Dally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;David Kirk, who was running the research lab at the time, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, thought a more permanent position at the research lab was a better idea. Dally told TechCrunch the pair put on a “full-court press” on why he should join Nvidia’s research lab and eventually convinced him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It wound up being kind of a perfect fit for my interests and my talents,” Dally said. “I think everybody’s always searching for the place in life where they can make the biggest contribution to the world. And I think for me, it’s definitely Nvidia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When Dally took over the lab in 2009, expansion was first and foremost. Researchers started working on areas outside of ray tracing right away, including circuit design and VLSI, or very large-scale integration, a process that combines millions of transistors on a single chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The research lab hasn’t stopped expanding since.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We try to figure out what will make the most positive difference for the company because we’re constantly seeing exciting new areas, but some of them, they do great work, but we have trouble saying if [we’ll be] wildly successful at this,” Dally said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For a while that was building better GPUs for artificial intelligence. Nvidia was early to the future AI boom and started tinkering with the idea of AI GPUs in 2010 —&amp;nbsp;more than a decade before the current AI frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We said this is amazing, this is gonna completely change the world,” Dally said. “We have to start doubling down on this and Jensen believed that when I told him that. We started specializing our GPUs for it and developing lots of software to support it, engaging with the researchers all around the world who were doing it, long before it was clearly relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-physical-ai-focus"&gt;Physical AI focus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, as Nvidia holds a commanding lead in the AI GPU market, the tech company has started to seek out new areas of demand beyond AI data centers. That search has led Nvidia to physical AI and robotics.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think eventually robots are going to be a huge player in the world and we want to basically be making the brains of all the robots,” Dally said. “To do that we need to start developing the key technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s where Sanja Fidler, the vice president of AI research at Nvidia, comes in. Fidler joined Nvidia’s research lab in 2018. At the time, she was already working on simulation models for robots with a team of students at MIT. When she told Huang about what they were working on at a researchers’ reception, he was interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I could not resist joining,” Fidler told TechCrunch in an interview. “It’s just such a great topic fit and at the same time was also such a great culture fit. Jensen told me, come work with me, not with us, not for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She joined Nvidia and got to work creating a research lab in Toronto called Omniverse, an Nvidia platform, that was focused on building simulations for physical AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036047" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SanjaFidler_1-2.jpg?w=544" width="544" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Sanja Fidler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The first challenge to building these simulated worlds was finding the necessary 3D data, Fidler said. This included finding the proper volume of potential images to use and building the technology needed to turn these images into 3D renditions the simulators could use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We invested in this technology called differentiable rendering, which essentially makes rendering amendable to AI,” Fidler said. “You go [from] rendering means from 3D to image or video. And we want it to go the other way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-world-models"&gt;World models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Omniverse released the first version of its model that turns images into 3D models, GANverse3D, in 2021. Then it got to work on figuring out the same process for video. Fidler said they used videos from robots and self-driving cars to create these 3D models and simulations through its Neural Reconstruction Engine, which the company first announced in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She added these technologies were the backbone of the company’s Cosmos family of world AI models that were announced at CES in January.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, the lab is focused on making these models faster. When you play a video game or simulation you want the tech to be able to respond in real time, Fidler said, for robots they are working to make the reaction time even faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The robot doesn’t need to watch the world in the same time, in the same way as the world works,” Fidler said. “It can watch it like 100x faster. So if we can make this model significantly faster than they are today, they’re going to be tremendously useful for robotic or physical AI applications.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company continues to make progress on this goal. Nvidia announced at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference on Monday a fleet of new world AI models designed for creating synthetic data that can be used to train robots. Nvidia also announced new libraries and infrastructure software aimed at robotics developers too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the progress —&amp;nbsp;and the current hype about robots, especially humanoids —&amp;nbsp;the Nvidia research team remains realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both Dally and Fidler said the industry is still at least a few years off from having a humanoid in your home, with Fidler comparing it to the hype and timeline regarding autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re making huge progress and I think AI has really been the enabler here,” Dally said. “Starting with visual AI for the robot perception, and then generative AI, that’s being hugely valuable for task and motion planning and manipulation. As we solve each of these individual little problems and as the amount of data we have to train our networks grows, these robots are going to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Beijing is demanding tech companies including Alibaba and ByteDance justify their orders of Nvidia’s H20 artificial intelligence chips, complicating the US chipmaker’s business in China after striking an export arrangement with the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech companies have been asked by regulators such as the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) to explain why they need to order Nvidia’s H20 chips instead of using domestic alternatives, said three people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tech companies, who were the main buyers of Nvidia’s H20 chips before their sale in China was restricted, were planning to downsize their orders as a result of the questions from regulators, said two of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not banned but has kind of become a politically incorrect thing to do,” said one Chinese data center operator about purchasing Nvidia’s H20 chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alibaba, ByteDance, and MIIT did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese regulators have expressed growing disapproval of companies using Nvidia’s chips for any government or security related projects. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that Chinese authorities had sent notices to a range of companies discouraging the use of the H20 chips, particularly for government-related work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is also working to promote domestic alternatives to Nvidia. Chinese chipmakers led by Huawei and Cambricon have been gaining market share after Nvidia’s H20 sales were restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, which recently agreed to pay the US government 15 percent of its revenues from chip sales in China in order to restart H20 sales to the country, is at the centre of a geopolitical battle between Beijing and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H20 revenue deal was criticized by US security experts who said the chips would help the Chinese military and undermine US strength in artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing has expressed concerns about security issues associated with Nvidia’s products, such as potential location tracking and remote shutdown capabilities. The US chipmaker denied having those features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump said on Monday that he might allow Nvidia to sell a more advanced artificial intelligence chip in China based on the chipmaker’s latest and most advanced Blackwell platform. The performance of H20 chips sold to China is restricted compared with those more advanced processors sold to customers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein analysts said in a recent report that it expected Nvidia’s China chip market share to drop to 55 percent this year from 66 percent in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rebecca Tinucci, who previously spent six years building Tesla’s charging network before the automaker gutted its charging staff last year, will take over as head of Uber Freight.&amp;nbsp;Ron will stay on as Uber Freight’s chairman.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“[Ron] will lead the go-to-market strategy, expanding key partnerships, and really bringing Waabi from the phase that we’ve been in to commercialization at scale,” Raquel Urtasun, Waabi’s founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “He has shown his ability to scale from inception to a $5 billion revenue company with Uber Freight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Urtasun and Ron go way back: Ron previously co-founded self-driving truck company Otto, which Uber acquired in 2016. He overlapped with Urtasun at Uber, where the latter was chief scientist, leading the ride-hail firm’s self-driving research from 2017 to 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Uber Freight is a digital marketplace connecting shippers with carriers, and the company aims to integrate self-driving trucks with the platform via partnerships with startups like Aurora Innovation and Waabi. Uber’s partnership with Waabi isn’t affected by Ron’s departure, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While working at Uber Freight, Ron says, he met regularly with chief supply chain officers and big carriers that he said “could not wait” for self-driving trucks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If the most impactful thing to do in the next decade is autonomy, and if the timing is right, then for me it’s really about joining forces with who I think is most positioned to lead the transformation,” he added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Urtasun claims Waabi’s “AI-first” approach to scaling autonomy has allowed it to do more with fewer resources and in less time than competitors.&amp;nbsp;Given this is a capital-intensive industry that’s seen several promising startups, like TuSimple and Embark, crash and burn, efficiency can be a major advantage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since it was founded in 2021, Waabi has raised $287.7 million in total, the bulk of which came from a $200 million Series B in 2024. Urtasun claims the company doesn’t need to raise more to get to its next phase of growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup’s chief competitor is Aurora, which this year launched the first commercial driverless trucking route in the U.S., and has raised nearly $3.46 billion through a combination of venture capital and its public listing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Waabi has managed to launch commercial pilots quickly because it does most training, testing, and validation in Waabi World, its closed-loop simulator that both virtually tests the self-driving software and teaches it in real time. More recently, Waabi took its simulator to the test track, overlaying virtual environments onto real-world driving conditions to simulate scenarios like accidents and construction zones without the actual risk, according to Urtasun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“At the beginning of the year, we reached feature complete, which basically means we have all the necessary things to remove the driver and [are focused] on the final performance improvement and validation,” Urtasun said. “We are on track for our driverless launch by the end of the year, which is the start of commercialization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup plans to launch in Texas, which has become the autonomous freight capital of the U.S., but it hasn’t yet disclosed which routes it’ll operate on or with which launch partners. The startup is working with Volvo Autonomous Solutions to develop and deploy custom-built AVs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Waabi will lead the technology and it will scale autonomy faster than ever expected,” Ron said, adding that he’s excited with the prospect of integrating the technology into the customers’ operations.&amp;nbsp;Part of that is a feature that would enable Waabi’s trucks to drive straight to customer depots, avoiding the need to build terminals for a hybrid setup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re going to create a commercial-ready solution that can really meet them,” Ron said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Urtasun claims Waabi’s “AI-first” approach to scaling autonomy has allowed it to do more with fewer resources and in less time than competitors.&amp;nbsp;Given this is a capital-intensive industry that’s seen several promising startups, like TuSimple and Embark, crash and burn, efficiency can be a major advantage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since it was founded in 2021, Waabi has raised $287.7 million in total, the bulk of which came from a $200 million Series B in 2024. Urtasun claims the company doesn’t need to raise more to get to its next phase of growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup’s chief competitor is Aurora, which this year launched the first commercial driverless trucking route in the U.S., and has raised nearly $3.46 billion through a combination of venture capital and its public listing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Waabi has managed to launch commercial pilots quickly because it does most training, testing, and validation in Waabi World, its closed-loop simulator that both virtually tests the self-driving software and teaches it in real time. More recently, Waabi took its simulator to the test track, overlaying virtual environments onto real-world driving conditions to simulate scenarios like accidents and construction zones without the actual risk, according to Urtasun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“At the beginning of the year, we reached feature complete, which basically means we have all the necessary things to remove the driver and [are focused] on the final performance improvement and validation,” Urtasun said. “We are on track for our driverless launch by the end of the year, which is the start of commercialization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup plans to launch in Texas, which has become the autonomous freight capital of the U.S., but it hasn’t yet disclosed which routes it’ll operate on or with which launch partners. The startup is working with Volvo Autonomous Solutions to develop and deploy custom-built AVs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Waabi will lead the technology and it will scale autonomy faster than ever expected,” Ron said, adding that he’s excited with the prospect of integrating the technology into the customers’ operations.&amp;nbsp;Part of that is a feature that would enable Waabi’s trucks to drive straight to customer depots, avoiding the need to build terminals for a hybrid setup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re going to create a commercial-ready solution that can really meet them,” Ron said.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;After spending last week hyping Grok's spicy new features, Elon Musk kicked off this week by threatening to sue Apple for supposedly gaming the App Store rankings to favor ChatGPT over Grok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation," Musk wrote on X, without providing any evidence. "xAI will take immediate legal action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another post, Musk tagged Apple, asking, "Why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your 'Must Have' section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Are you playing politics?" Musk asked. "What gives? Inquiring minds want to know."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple did not respond to the post and has not responded to Ars' request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Musk's complaints is an OpenAI partnership that Apple announced last year, integrating ChatGPT into versions of its iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk has alleged that this partnership incentivized Apple to boost ChatGPT rankings. OpenAI's popular chatbot "currently holds the top spot in the App Store's 'Top Free Apps' section for iPhones in the US," Reuters noted, "while xAI's Grok ranks fifth and Google’s Gemini chatbot sits at 57th." Sensor Tower data shows ChatGPT similarly tops Google Play Store rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Musk seems insistent that ChatGPT is artificially locked in the lead, fact-checkers on X added a community note to his post. They confirmed that at least one other AI tool has somewhat recently unseated ChatGPT in the US rankings. Back in January, DeepSeek topped App Store charts and held the lead for days, ABC News reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment on Musk's allegations, but an OpenAI developer, Steven Heidel, did add a quip in response to one of Musk's posts, writing, "Don't forget to also blame Google for OpenAI being #1 on Android, and blame SimilarWeb for putting ChatGPT above X on the most-visited websites list, and blame...."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday afternoon, Sam Altman also took to X to fire back a response to Musk's allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like," Altman wrote, linking to a Platformer story reporting that Musk built a special system to ensure his posts are viewed first on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Musk pulls Apple into OpenAI battle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that Musk is attacking Apple as a publicity stunt to get more people to check out Grok as supposedly secretly deserving of the top spot in the App Store. Musk may also be exploring an antitrust claim due to Apple's recent struggles defending against accusations that its App Store is anticompetitive in both the European Union and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But considering Musk's long-time beef with OpenAI—which he has sued for allegedly making a "fool" out of him by convincing him to invest early on with a false promise to always remain a nonprofit—the accusations could be linked to his ire over OpenAI using his money to beat him to releasing a more popular chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear where Musk's legal fight is going. Most recently in that litigation, OpenAI has accused Musk of largely refusing to participate in discovery, allegedly using delay tactics to keep OpenAI from raising a defense against Musk's claims. Musk apparently won't even share his own emails from his own companies, which must have been a predictable ask when he filed the lawsuit, in defiance of a judge's order, OpenAI alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has suggested that Musk is guilty of "substantial bad-faith conduct" in the litigation, which they alleged is part of a "campaign of harassment, interference, and misinformation designed to take down OpenAI and clear the field for himself."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the filing, they point to Musk seeking to give himself "sole control" of a for-profit restructuring of OpenAI back in 2017 as evidence that Musk was supposedly never fully invested in OpenAI's original non-profit mission that he now appears to be urgently defending. Further, Musk allegedly tried to convince OpenAI to make a for-profit pivot in 2018 by letting Tesla absorb the company. That, Musk allegedly hoped, would have turned Tesla into OpenAI's "cash cow," the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;As more recent evidence of allegedly bad-faith conduct, OpenAI noted that Musk signed a letter calling for a moratorium on all AI development in 2023. That six-month pause on all AI development may have bought Musk time to catch up with ChatGPT, as he was at that time plowing ahead with his plans to release Grok, OpenAI alleged, questioning the sincerity of Musk's co-signing of the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, in 2025, OpenAI flagged Musk's allegedly "sham bid" to buy OpenAI for $97 billion "as a 'naked effort to disrupt the [OpenAI] board’s consideration of a potential restructuring and to sow confusion among employees and potential investors,' for the ultimate purpose of threatening 'OpenAI’s ability to pursue its mission on terms uncorrupted by unlawful harassment and interference.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this "deceptive conduct," OpenAI alleged, shows that Musk has "unclean hands," and his "supposed grievances are not genuinely held."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the lawsuit moves forward, discovery is scheduled to end in December, giving OpenAI four months to prod Musk for the evidence they claim to need to raise these defenses and more. In the meantime, Musk apparently is mulling filing a new complaint against Apple that could lead to additional attacks on OpenAI's business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most damning for Musk, however, OpenAI is attempting to subpoena Musk's lawyer, Marc Toberoff, who, it claims, "played a key role in coordinating Musk’s sham bid for OpenAI—including by hastily soliciting numerous third parties to participate in the supposed hostile takeover." If OpenAI beats the lawsuit, it could be a major blow to Musk's ego as he seeks to dominate the AI industry by outperforming his former partner. Most recently, Musk vowed that Grok 5 will soon outperform OpenAI's GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if Musk pulls out a win, any "unlawful benefits" that OpenAI received as a result of Musk's early investment could be disgorged, perhaps hobbling OpenAI just as xAI receives funding to continue building out "the world’s biggest supercomputer, Colossus," to supercharge Grok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI did not respond to Ars' request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday afternoon, Sam Altman also took to X to fire back a response to Musk's allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like," Altman wrote, linking to a Platformer story reporting that Musk built a special system to ensure his posts are viewed first on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Musk pulls Apple into OpenAI battle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that Musk is attacking Apple as a publicity stunt to get more people to check out Grok as supposedly secretly deserving of the top spot in the App Store. Musk may also be exploring an antitrust claim due to Apple's recent struggles defending against accusations that its App Store is anticompetitive in both the European Union and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But considering Musk's long-time beef with OpenAI—which he has sued for allegedly making a "fool" out of him by convincing him to invest early on with a false promise to always remain a nonprofit—the accusations could be linked to his ire over OpenAI using his money to beat him to releasing a more popular chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear where Musk's legal fight is going. Most recently in that litigation, OpenAI has accused Musk of largely refusing to participate in discovery, allegedly using delay tactics to keep OpenAI from raising a defense against Musk's claims. Musk apparently won't even share his own emails from his own companies, which must have been a predictable ask when he filed the lawsuit, in defiance of a judge's order, OpenAI alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has suggested that Musk is guilty of "substantial bad-faith conduct" in the litigation, which they alleged is part of a "campaign of harassment, interference, and misinformation designed to take down OpenAI and clear the field for himself."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the filing, they point to Musk seeking to give himself "sole control" of a for-profit restructuring of OpenAI back in 2017 as evidence that Musk was supposedly never fully invested in OpenAI's original non-profit mission that he now appears to be urgently defending. Further, Musk allegedly tried to convince OpenAI to make a for-profit pivot in 2018 by letting Tesla absorb the company. That, Musk allegedly hoped, would have turned Tesla into OpenAI's "cash cow," the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;As more recent evidence of allegedly bad-faith conduct, OpenAI noted that Musk signed a letter calling for a moratorium on all AI development in 2023. That six-month pause on all AI development may have bought Musk time to catch up with ChatGPT, as he was at that time plowing ahead with his plans to release Grok, OpenAI alleged, questioning the sincerity of Musk's co-signing of the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, in 2025, OpenAI flagged Musk's allegedly "sham bid" to buy OpenAI for $97 billion "as a 'naked effort to disrupt the [OpenAI] board’s consideration of a potential restructuring and to sow confusion among employees and potential investors,' for the ultimate purpose of threatening 'OpenAI’s ability to pursue its mission on terms uncorrupted by unlawful harassment and interference.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this "deceptive conduct," OpenAI alleged, shows that Musk has "unclean hands," and his "supposed grievances are not genuinely held."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the lawsuit moves forward, discovery is scheduled to end in December, giving OpenAI four months to prod Musk for the evidence they claim to need to raise these defenses and more. In the meantime, Musk apparently is mulling filing a new complaint against Apple that could lead to additional attacks on OpenAI's business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most damning for Musk, however, OpenAI is attempting to subpoena Musk's lawyer, Marc Toberoff, who, it claims, "played a key role in coordinating Musk’s sham bid for OpenAI—including by hastily soliciting numerous third parties to participate in the supposed hostile takeover." If OpenAI beats the lawsuit, it could be a major blow to Musk's ego as he seeks to dominate the AI industry by outperforming his former partner. Most recently, Musk vowed that Grok 5 will soon outperform OpenAI's GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if Musk pulls out a win, any "unlawful benefits" that OpenAI received as a result of Musk's early investment could be disgorged, perhaps hobbling OpenAI just as xAI receives funding to continue building out "the world’s biggest supercomputer, Colossus," to supercharge Grok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI did not respond to Ars' request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

The AI giant said Tuesday it would also offer its Claude models to government agencies for just $1 — but not only to the executive branch. Anthropic is targeting “all three branches” of the U.S. government, including the legislative and judiciary branches.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The package will be available for one year, says Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move comes after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind were added to the General Services Administration’s list of approved AI vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies.&amp;nbsp;TechCrunch has reached out to Google to see if it plans to respond to Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s challenges in kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic’s escalation — a response to OpenAI’s attempt to undercut the competition — is a strategic play meant to broaden the company’s foothold in federal AI usage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services,” Anthropic said in a statement. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we’re helping ensure AI serves the public interest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government. The latter supports FedRAMP High workloads so that federal workers can use Claude for handling sensitive unclassified work, according to the company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;FedRAMP High is a stringent security baseline within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for handling unclassified sensitive government data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic will also provide technical support to help agencies integrate AI tools into their workflows, according to the company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic, along with OpenAI, xAI, and Google, has been granted up to $200 million by the Department of Defense to leverage AI for national security, but the AI firm clearly hopes to integrate into a broader array of government work, including science research and health services. Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government’s highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic’s multicloud access could give it an edge in the competition with OpenAI, whose current official FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud only. While Azure is widely adopted in government, some government agencies and security teams might prioritize data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and the operational flexibility a multicloud strategy offers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is, however, actively working to reduce its reliance on Azure so it can embrace a more diversified infrastructure approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Anthropic’s API customers, the company’s Claude Sonnet 4 AI model now has a 1 million token context window — meaning the AI can handle requests as long as 750,000 words, more than the entire “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, or 75,000 lines of code. That’s roughly five times Claude’s previous limit (200,000 tokens), and more than double the 400,000 token context window offered by OpenAI’s GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Long context will also be available for Claude Sonnet 4 through Anthropic’s cloud partners, including on Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic has built one of the largest enterprise businesses among AI model developers, largely by selling Claude to AI coding platforms such as Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Anysphere’s Cursor. While Claude has become the model of choice among developers, GPT-5 may threaten Anthropic’s dominance with its competitive pricing and strong coding performance. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell even helped OpenAI announce the launch of GPT-5, which is now the default AI model for new users in Cursor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic’s product lead for the Claude platform, Brad Abrams, told TechCrunch in an interview that he expects AI coding platforms to get a “lot of benefit” from this update. When asked if GPT-5 put a dent in Claude’s API usage, Abrams downplayed the concern, saying he’s “really happy with the API business and the way it’s been growing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whereas OpenAI generates most of its revenue from consumer subscriptions to ChatGPT, Anthropic’s business centers around selling AI models to enterprises through an API. That’s made AI coding platforms a key customer for Anthropic and could be why the company is throwing in some new perks to attract users in the face of GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last week, Anthropic unveiled an updated version of its largest AI model, Claude Opus 4.1, which pushed the company’s AI coding capabilities a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Generally speaking, AI models tend to perform better on all tasks when they have more context, but especially for software engineering problems. For example, if you ask an AI model to spin up a new feature for your app, it’s likely to do a better job if it can see the entire project, rather than just a small section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Abrams also told TechCrunch that Claude’s large context window helps it perform better at long agentic coding tasks, in which the AI model is autonomously working on a problem for minutes or hours. With a large context window, Claude can remember all its previous steps in long-horizon tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But some companies have taken large context windows to an extreme, claiming their AI models can process massive prompts. Google offers a 2 million token context window for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Meta offers a 10 million token context window for Llama 4 Scout.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some studies suggest there’s a limit to how effective large context windows can be; AI models are not great at processing those massive prompts. Abrams said that Anthropic’s research team focused on increasing not just the context window for Claude, but also the “effective context window,” suggesting that its AI can understand most of the information it’s given. However, he declined to reveal Anthropic’s exact techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When prompts to Claude Sonnet 4 are over 200,000 tokens, Anthropic will charge more to API users, at $6 per million input tokens and $22.50 per million output tokens (up from $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Generally speaking, AI models tend to perform better on all tasks when they have more context, but especially for software engineering problems. For example, if you ask an AI model to spin up a new feature for your app, it’s likely to do a better job if it can see the entire project, rather than just a small section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Abrams also told TechCrunch that Claude’s large context window helps it perform better at long agentic coding tasks, in which the AI model is autonomously working on a problem for minutes or hours. With a large context window, Claude can remember all its previous steps in long-horizon tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But some companies have taken large context windows to an extreme, claiming their AI models can process massive prompts. Google offers a 2 million token context window for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Meta offers a 10 million token context window for Llama 4 Scout.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some studies suggest there’s a limit to how effective large context windows can be; AI models are not great at processing those massive prompts. Abrams said that Anthropic’s research team focused on increasing not just the context window for Claude, but also the “effective context window,” suggesting that its AI can understand most of the information it’s given. However, he declined to reveal Anthropic’s exact techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When prompts to Claude Sonnet 4 are over 200,000 tokens, Anthropic will charge more to API users, at $6 per million input tokens and $22.50 per million output tokens (up from $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens).&lt;/p&gt;

On Thursday, OpenAI &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/gpt-5/" rel="rel"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; GPT-5. While state-of-the-art in most respects, GPT-5 is not a step-change improvement over competing systems, or even recent OpenAI models—but we shouldn’t have expected it to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPT-5 is state of the art in most respects. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;GPT-5 isn’t a single model like GPTs 1 through 4. It is a system of two models: a base model that answers questions quickly and is better at tasks like creative writing (an improved version of 4o), and a reasoning model that can answer questions step-by-step and is better at tasks like coding or mathematics (think o3). GPT-5 uses one model or the other based on a user’s prompt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These two models combine to form a broadly capable system. For example, GPT-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://scale.com/leaderboard/humanitys_last_exam" rel="rel"&gt;Humanity’s Last Exam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the software engineering benchmark SWE-bench Verified, and holds the top spot on LMArena’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text" rel="rel"&gt;text leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEcb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6db7a75-0090-42ca-8439-c67d5cde44c0_632x876.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="876" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEcb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6db7a75-0090-42ca-8439-c67d5cde44c0_632x876.png" width="632" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPT-5 hallucinates less than previous OpenAI models.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; GPT-5 also has a markedly lower hallucination rate than previous models as evaluated both on open-source prompts and on real, de-identified ChatGPT traffic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lower hallucination rates help GPT-5 perform better in healthcare applications. GPT-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on OpenAI’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/healthbench/" rel="rel"&gt;Healthbench&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. For example, OpenAI finds that GPT-5 (thinking) hallucinates 1.6% of the time during challenging healthcare conversations, improving significantly on o3’s 12.9% hallucination rate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VOUF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89976d9-abc7-44d4-9d7b-592dada46bc7_744x892.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="892" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VOUF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89976d9-abc7-44d4-9d7b-592dada46bc7_744x892.png" width="744" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPT-5 is a state-of-the-art text agent. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;GPT-5 leads on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.textquests.ai/" rel="rel"&gt;a new benchmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that measures how well AI systems perform in interactive long text-based games, which are examples of challenging exploratory environments. No AI systems can beat the games without clues, and none are as capable as humans—but GPT-5 does the best of models tested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dA-q!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b4694cd-18b8-48e2-9b33-344f9f6604cd_1600x898.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="817" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dA-q!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b4694cd-18b8-48e2-9b33-344f9f6604cd_1600x898.png" width="1456" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPT-5 is best understood as a consolidation of features developed since GPT-4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; GPT-5 is not a state-of-the-art model across the board. For example, it takes second to xAI’s Grok 4 on the abstract pattern recognition benchmarks &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://arcprize.org/leaderboard" rel="rel"&gt;ARC-AGI-1 and 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. GPT-5 also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/eli_lifland/status/1953507434238288230" rel="rel"&gt;doesn’t improve over o3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on several coding benchmarks, even though it does on SWE-bench Verified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Similarly, the base model GPT-5 uses is an updated version of 4o—which is cheap enough for OpenAI to roll out GPT-5 to its now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/openai-chatgpt-700-million-users.html" rel="rel"&gt;700 million active weekly users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—instead of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/" rel="rel"&gt;GPT-4.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. That means GPT-5 misses out on some of GPT-4.1’s context window improvements over 4o.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those expecting another GPT-3 to GPT-4 improvement in capabilities, GPT-5 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://manifold.markets/Thomas42/how-will-gpt-5-exceeds-expectations" rel="rel"&gt;underperformed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But that wasn’t a realistic expectation—OpenAI has continually rolled out new models and features since GPT-4 in response to competition from other AI companies. GPT-5 is better understood as a consolidation of the improvements OpenAI has developed since GPT-4, and which GPT-4 didn’t have. These include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search and tool use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: GPT-5 has access to search, meaning that its knowledge isn’t limited to what it can memorize during pretraining. It also has access to deep research, agent integrations, and can run code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: GPT-4 was released before OpenAI started using reinforcement learning for thinking, and performed far below expert levels on math, coding, and science tasks. GPT-5 (thinking) performs at a PhD level on similar tasks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image recognition and generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: GPT-5 integrates OpenAI’s visual systems, meaning that it can understand and generate visual inputs and outputs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context length&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: GPT-4’s context window was about eight thousand tokens—about the size of a short research paper. GPT’s context window is 256 thousand tokens—about 2-3 full-length novels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While GPT-5 isn’t a step-change improvement over its competitors—or even recent OpenAI models like 4o and the o series—the better point of comparison is with what GPT-4 could do when it was released in 2023. In that comparison, GPT-5 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;look like a step-change improvement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would GPT-5 have needed to feel like a discontinuous improvement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; ChatGPT still lacks sufficient agency to be broadly economically useful. Thinking likely isn’t enough for agency—for example, to reliably use computers, AI agents may need improved visual reasoning and the ability to store lessons from tasks into a long-term memory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, however, we should expect these and other improvements to be deployed continually—not in big jumps every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;President Trump has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/06/donald-trump%E2%80%91100%E2%80%91percent%E2%80%91tariffs%E2%80%91chips%E2%80%91semiconductors/85551845007/" rel="rel"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a proposal to impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors, aiming to boost domestic production.

No AI systems can beat the games without clues, and none are as capable as humans—but GPT-5 does the best of models tested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dA-q!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b4694cd-18b8-48e2-9b33-344f9f6604cd_1600x898.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="817" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dA-q!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b4694cd-18b8-48e2-9b33-344f9f6604cd_1600x898.png" width="1456" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPT-5 is best understood as a consolidation of features developed since GPT-4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; GPT-5 is not a state-of-the-art model across the board. For example, it takes second to xAI’s Grok 4 on the abstract pattern recognition benchmarks &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://arcprize.org/leaderboard" rel="rel"&gt;ARC-AGI-1 and 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. GPT-5 also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/eli_lifland/status/1953507434238288230" rel="rel"&gt;doesn’t improve over o3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on several coding benchmarks, even though it does on SWE-bench Verified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Similarly, the base model GPT-5 uses is an updated version of 4o—which is cheap enough for OpenAI to roll out GPT-5 to its now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/openai-chatgpt-700-million-users.html" rel="rel"&gt;700 million active weekly users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—instead of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/" rel="rel"&gt;GPT-4.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. That means GPT-5 misses out on some of GPT-4.1’s context window improvements over 4o.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those expecting another GPT-3 to GPT-4 improvement in capabilities, GPT-5 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://manifold.markets/Thomas42/how-will-gpt-5-exceeds-expectations" rel="rel"&gt;underperformed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But that wasn’t a realistic expectation—OpenAI has continually rolled out new models and features since GPT-4 in response to competition from other AI companies. GPT-5 is better understood as a consolidation of the improvements OpenAI has developed since GPT-4, and which GPT-4 didn’t have. These include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search and tool use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: GPT-5 has access to search, meaning that its knowledge isn’t limited to what it can memorize during pretraining. It also has access to deep research, agent integrations, and can run code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: GPT-4 was released before OpenAI started using reinforcement learning for thinking, and performed far below expert levels on math, coding, and science tasks. GPT-5 (thinking) performs at a PhD level on similar tasks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image recognition and generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: GPT-5 integrates OpenAI’s visual systems, meaning that it can understand and generate visual inputs and outputs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context length&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: GPT-4’s context window was about eight thousand tokens—about the size of a short research paper. GPT’s context window is 256 thousand tokens—about 2-3 full-length novels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While GPT-5 isn’t a step-change improvement over its competitors—or even recent OpenAI models like 4o and the o series—the better point of comparison is with what GPT-4 could do when it was released in 2023. In that comparison, GPT-5 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;look like a step-change improvement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would GPT-5 have needed to feel like a discontinuous improvement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; ChatGPT still lacks sufficient agency to be broadly economically useful. Thinking likely isn’t enough for agency—for example, to reliably use computers, AI agents may need improved visual reasoning and the ability to store lessons from tasks into a long-term memory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, however, we should expect these and other improvements to be deployed continually—not in big jumps every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;President Trump has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/06/donald-trump%E2%80%91100%E2%80%91percent%E2%80%91tariffs%E2%80%91chips%E2%80%91semiconductors/85551845007/" rel="rel"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a proposal to impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors, aiming to boost domestic production.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity tells TC the terms of the offer include a commitment to keep Chrome’s underlying engine, Chromium, open source and continue to invest in it. Perplexity’s offer includes a promise to invest $3 billion into the open source project.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity is also promising not to change the user defaults of Chrome users, including the default search engine. That is, Perplexity is promising to leave Google as the search engine rather than making its own AI-powered option the default.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that Google be forced to sell Chrome after a judge ruled the tech giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search. Google has not agreed to sell Chrome and has vowed to fight the ruling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Perplexity spokesperson believes the court will soon set terms for remedies, perhaps later this month. (Google is also fighting another federal case where the judge ruled it illegally monopolized adtech, and the DOJ is proposing Google be forced to divest two of its adtech products or otherwise break up its ad business.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When the DOJ first proposed that Google divest Chrome, both OpenAI and Perplexity expressed interest in buying it. Given that Chrome is the dominant browser, with 68% marketshare according to Statcounter, if the court rules Chrome must be sold, no doubt others worldwide would want to bid as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Interestingly, the CEO of rival search engine DuckDuckGo testified in April that Chrome could be worth “upwards of $50 billion,” Bloomberg reported at the time. Should Perplexity’s offer succeed, it could be considered a bargain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, this offer for Chrome is far more than Perplexity has raised from investors and more than the startup’s current valuation. Perplexity has raised about $1.5 billion to date, PitchBook estimates, including an extension round of $100 million raised last month that valued it at $18 billion, Bloomberg reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the meantime, Perplexity last month launched its own browser, called Comet, in its bid to grow its AI search business without having to serve its customers through a browser, particularly one owned by its main rival Google.&lt;/p&gt;

After more than 17 years at the company, he departed to launch his own startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I was seeing how fast technology was changing, and I felt there are certain ideas that are best explored in the context of a startup,” Petrou told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;His ultimate idea was to build Continua, a consumer-facing company that uses AI agents to enhance collaboration and interaction in group chats on SMS, iMessage, and Discord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The simple way to think about it is that we’re bringing the power of LLMs to group chats,” Petrou said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Continua announced on Tuesday that it has raised an $8 million seed round. The funding was led by GV, with additional participation from Bessemer Ventures Partners and a group of angel investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When developing Continua, Petrou noticed that people would interact with ChatGPT or another LLM, and then would copy and paste what they learned into their group conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you and I are planning a trip, or if we’re trying to figure out what to have for dinner, or what movie to watch, all of these things can be facilitated by an LLM participating in a group chat with us,” Petrou said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Continua claims its AI agents can reduce group chat chaos by joining conversations and offering helpful information only when it’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As the group discusses projects and common plans, Continua can automatically set reminders, launch polls, add calendar invitations, or generate Google documents with checklists and to-do lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If a user forgets details from the group chat, such as the meeting time or location, they can simply direct message Continua to privately ask for the information.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At first glance, Continua may seem like a straightforward application of AI, but Petrou says that getting LLM to participate in a conversation with multiple humans is a rather complex technical problem. Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune its technology to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036189" height="307" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Coachella.png" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM’s brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it’s chiming in too often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Erik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua’s group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who’s been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Nordlander, Continua has several potential paths to profitability. The agent is already assisting with event planning and trip booking, which he suggested they could charge for in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

After more than 17 years at the company, he departed to launch his own startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I was seeing how fast technology was changing, and I felt there are certain ideas that are best explored in the context of a startup,” Petrou told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;His ultimate idea was to build Continua, a consumer-facing company that uses AI agents to enhance collaboration and interaction in group chats on SMS, iMessage, and Discord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The simple way to think about it is that we’re bringing the power of LLMs to group chats,” Petrou said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Continua announced on Tuesday that it has raised an $8 million seed round. The funding was led by GV, with additional participation from Bessemer Ventures Partners and a group of angel investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When developing Continua, Petrou noticed that people would interact with ChatGPT or another LLM, and then would copy and paste what they learned into their group conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you and I are planning a trip, or if we’re trying to figure out what to have for dinner, or what movie to watch, all of these things can be facilitated by an LLM participating in a group chat with us,” Petrou said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While g-AMIE is able to follow guardrails in the vast majority of the cases, there are caveats and nuances in classifying individualized medical advice. Our results are based on a single rating per case even though we observed significant disagreement among raters in previous studies. Moreover, the comparison to both control groups should not be taken as commentary on their ability to follow the supplied guardrails; PCPs in particular are not used to withholding medical advice in consultations. Considerable further development of AI oversight paradigms in real-world settings is required to ensure generalisation of our proposed framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While g-AMIE’s SOAP notes included confabulations in a few cases, we found that such confabulations occur at a similar rate as misremembering by both guardrail PCPs and guardrail NP/PAs. It is noteworthy, however, that g-AMIE’s notes are considerably more verbose, which leads to longer oversight times and a higher rate of edits focused on reducing verbosity. In interviews with overseeing PCPs, we also found that oversight is mentally demanding, which is consistent with prior work on cognitive load of AI-assisted decision support systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, during history taking, we believe this verbosity contributes to g-AMIE’s higher ratings for how information is explained and rapport is built. Patient actors and independent physicians preferred g-AMIE’s patient messages and its demonstration of patient empathy. These findings highlight that future work aimed at finding the right trade-off in terms of verbosity between history taking, medical notes and patient messages is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that NPs and PAs consistently outperform PCPs in history taking quality, following guardrails and diagnostic quality. However, these differences should not be extrapolated to meaningful indicators of relative performance in the real world. The tested workflow was designed to explore a paradigm of AI oversight and both control groups are provided primarily to contextualize g-AMIE’s performance. None received specific training for this workflow, and it does not account for several real-world professional needs. Therefore, it would likely significantly underestimate clinicians’ capabilities. Moreover, the recruited NPs and PAs had more experience and may be more familiar with patient-focused history-taking. PCPs, in contrast, are taught to explicitly link history-taking to the diagnostic process, linking questions to direct hypothesis testing, and the proposed workflow would likely have significantly impacted their consultation performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, patient actors cannot act as an exact substitute for real patients, especially in combination with our 60 constructed scenario packs.

Of the 337 active and revenue-generating AI companion apps available worldwide, 128 were released in 2025 so far, according to new data provided to TechCrunch by app intelligence firm Appfigures. This subsection of the AI market on mobile has now generated $82 million during the first half of the year and is on track to pull in over $120 million by year-end, the firm’s analysis indicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036210" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-companion-app-releases-by-year.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike general-purpose chatbots, AI companion apps anthropomorphize AI interactions by allowing users to converse with custom characters, including friends, lovers, girlfriends or boyfriends, fantasy characters, and more. Appfigures defined the market segment in the same way, describing companion apps as those in which the user can interact with either premade or user-generated synthetic characters meant to embody an actual personality.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Popular apps in this space include Replika, Character.AI, PolyBuzz, Chai, and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As of July 2025, AI companion apps across the Apple App Store and Google Play have been downloaded 220 million times globally. During the first half of 2025, downloads were up 88% year-over-year, reaching 60 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036211" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-companion-app-releases-in-h1.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Appfigures crunched the numbers and found that, as of July 2025, AI companion apps have driven $221 million in consumer spending worldwide. So far this year, these apps have generated 64% more revenue than during the same period in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The top 10% of all AI companion apps generate 89% of the revenue in the category, the data shows. In addition, around 10% (or 33) of the apps have exceeded $1 million in lifetime consumer spending. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036209" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/revenue-from-top-10-percent-of-ai-companion-apps.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Revenue per download is also up $0.66 from $0.52 in 2024 to $1.18 for the category so far in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While dedicated AI companion apps are fairly popular, bigger companies like xAI are also moving into the market. In July, xAI’s Grok launched AI companions, including an anime girl and guy, as well as a snarky 3D fox. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, ChatGPT’s recent upgrade to GPT-5 brought to light the fact that many of its users felt a kinship with the older model, as they mourned the loss of their AI companion, whom they had come to depend upon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To address these and other concerns about GPT-5’s performance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman brought back the 4o model for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036212" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-companion-app-revenue-2024-2025-ytd-and-revenue-per-download.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google last year tapped into the market, too, when it hired away Character.ai’s founder, Noam Shazeer. The Character.ai app lives on and still has tens of millions of monthly active users.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Appfigures’ data, the most popular AI companion apps are those used by people looking for an AI girlfriend. Of the active apps on the market today, 17% have an app name that includes the word “girlfriend,” compared with 4% that say “boyfriend” or “fantasy.” Terms like anime, soulmate, and lover, among others, are less frequently mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036218" height="531" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-companion-app-names.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Appfigures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Appfigures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm notes there were likely a number of other AI companion apps that launched on the app stores since 2022, but were later removed after failing to gain traction in terms of revenue or downloads.

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036218" height="531" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-companion-app-names.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Appfigures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Appfigures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm notes there were likely a number of other AI companion apps that launched on the app stores since 2022, but were later removed after failing to gain traction in terms of revenue or downloads. Those weren’t factored into its analysis, however.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/ai-companion-apps-on-track-to-pull-in-120m-in-2025/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 17:38:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] YouTube backlash begins: “Why is AI combing through every single video I watch?” (AI – Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/50k-youtubers-rage-against-ai-spying-that-could-expose-identities/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of YouTubers are raging against YouTube's plan to use AI to detect underage users in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, a Change.org petition rapidly neared its 50,000-signature goal, with tens of thousands hoping that with enough users protesting, the wide rollout of the AI age checks might be stopped. They fear the age checks will make it harder to access content they love while staying anonymous on the platform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube's age verification system estimates user ages by interpreting a "variety of signals," YouTube's announcement said, including "the types of videos a user is searching for, the categories of videos they have watched, or the longevity of the account."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user is estimated to be under 18, YouTube restricts the account by disabling personalized ads, turning on digital wellbeing tools to prevent young users from being bombarded with harmful content, and adding other safeguards, like limiting repetitive views of certain types of content. To lift these restrictions, YouTube requires users to share either a government ID, a credit card, or a selfie to authenticate their actual ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy experts previously told Ars that YouTube's AI age checks are concerning. YouTube does not specify how any of the data received from users incorrectly labeled as teens will be used or how long it will be stored. A YouTube spokesperson only told Ars that the company "does not retain data from" a user's "ID or Payment Card for the purposes of advertising."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users signing the Change.org petition shared privacy experts' concerns. They’re concerned that an invasive system of perhaps questionable quality will deem their viewing habits immature, requiring them to hand over data that could be leaked or breached. Experts have noted that even the best age-estimation tech has about a two-year error window on each side, meaning YouTubers between 16 and 20 may be especially susceptible to incorrect age estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Among concerned users fighting to block AI age checks is the petition starter, an anonymous YouTuber who runs a monetized account exploring video game lore called "Gerfdas Gaming" (who, for simplicity's sake, we'll refer to as Gerfdas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerfdas told Ars that YouTube's appeal process "raises major privacy concerns," leaving YouTubers wondering, "where is this sensitive data stored, and how secure is it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If YouTube suffers a breach, people’s names, IDs, and faces could end up in the wrong hands," Gerfdas suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerfdas also takes issue with the AI age verification system itself, noting that any monetized account already shares personal information with YouTube, but it's disturbing to think that the AI is scanning every user's viewing habits in the background just to catch some kids improperly using the platform. Several commenters on the petition noted that the AI age checks seemed to be created mainly to appease parents who struggle to police their own kids' viewing habits, repeatedly asking, "Isn't this why they made YouTube Kids?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even without requesting ID, why is an AI combing through every single video I watch?" Gerfdas posited. "As an adult, I should be able to watch what I want within the law—and if the viewer is a child, that responsibility belongs to their parents, not a corporation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube did not respond to multiple requests to comment and so far has not acknowledged Gerfdas' petition. But Gerfdas is hoping that enough backlash may force YouTube to rethink its AI age checks, telling Ars that "even if they don’t respond right away, we’ll keep making noise until they do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adult YouTubers defend childish viewing habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ars monitored, hundreds of self-described YouTubers joined Gerfdas' petition hourly. Gerfdas told Ars the petition's popularity suggested that "this isn’t just a YouTube issue." As age checks become more commonplace across the Internet due to regulatory pressure globally, people motivated to defend digital freedom are balking and increasingly banding together, Gerfdas said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;"To a lot of people, this feels like mass surveillance and censorship under the banner of 'protecting kids,'" Gerfdas told Ars. "People want a free, open Internet without having their activities constantly tracked or filtered."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For YouTubers signing Gerfdas' petition, the pressure is on to disrupt age-verification trends that, experts told Ars, risk exposing vulnerable users who rely on anonymity to use YouTube. That includes queer YouTubers, one of whom commented that sharing their ID or selfie to appeal an AI age check would "absolutely be putting myself in danger."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious question for critics is how a YouTube watch history could possibly be a reliable age indicator, especially since many adults are nostalgic for childhood content on YouTube. One commenter, Estelle, said that she "relies on childish and silly content to get through the rough days" as a person with disabilities. Videos like "toy unboxings" or "silly animations" offer one way "to literally cope in a world that doesn’t want me in it," she wrote, noting that "nobody asked for" some "weird dumb robot policing" YouTubers for loving videos made for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commenters with autism suggested that they may be specifically targeted by the AI system since their special interests may be perceived by AI as "childish." Others identified as parents wondering how the AI system might interpret moments when their child uses a shared account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy experts have criticized YouTube's lack of transparency on its AI age-estimation system, noting that YouTube has not shared any external research verifying the model's effectiveness. One YouTuber signing Gerfdas' petition, Karina, pointed out a recent Discord mishap in which a 30-year-old was flagged as underage, while noting that AI age checks on other platforms haven't been that reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;"I'm autistic," Karina wrote. "It's not fun being a grown woman and being treated like a child because of your interests." Further, "the first rule of Internet safety is to never give out your personal information online, because it's so easy for it to get stolen," Karina said. "It's concerning that YouTube somehow thinks that this is a good idea."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressing distrust in YouTube's AI was a common theme throughout the petition, as well as expressing distrust in YouTube's motives in launching the AI system. One commenter, Ananda, fumed, "This new policy is all about data mining to get rid of anonymity on the Internet once and for all. The Internet should not be a sanitized corporate theme park where everything is monetized and moralized."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another particularly grumpy commenter summed up criticism of YouTube's AI age checks, writing, "We're not living in a dystopia. We're living in Earth. I refuse to give ID or identification to watch damn videos."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Gerfdas, it's likely hard not to be sympathetic to another group of commenters signing the petition—teen content creators who don't want AI to restrict their YouTube activity. Gerfdas started watching YouTube at 13, eventually starting a channel as an adult in 2023 after being heavily influenced by favorite content creators Gerfdas grew up watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, Gerfdas told Ars, YouTube would end the AI age-check experiment and keep the prior system, while maintaining efforts with YouTube Kids to help parents restrict children's viewing. Although Gerfdas partly depends on the platform for income, if YouTube launched the AI system platform-wide, Gerfdas said then it might be time to "seriously" consider leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We cannot allow YouTube to quietly implement AI surveillance that violates privacy and autonomy," Gerfdas' Change.org petition said. "Once these systems are normalized, they rarely go away—they expand. If we don't speak up now, we risk losing our ability to browse, create, and enjoy content freely. This is about more than YouTube. This is about digital freedom."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among concerned users fighting to block AI age checks is the petition starter, an anonymous YouTuber who runs a monetized account exploring video game lore called "Gerfdas Gaming" (who, for simplicity's sake, we'll refer to as Gerfdas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerfdas told Ars that YouTube's appeal process "raises major privacy concerns," leaving YouTubers wondering, "where is this sensitive data stored, and how secure is it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If YouTube suffers a breach, people’s names, IDs, and faces could end up in the wrong hands," Gerfdas suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerfdas also takes issue with the AI age verification system itself, noting that any monetized account already shares personal information with YouTube, but it's disturbing to think that the AI is scanning every user's viewing habits in the background just to catch some kids improperly using the platform. Several commenters on the petition noted that the AI age checks seemed to be created mainly to appease parents who struggle to police their own kids' viewing habits, repeatedly asking, "Isn't this why they made YouTube Kids?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even without requesting ID, why is an AI combing through every single video I watch?" Gerfdas posited. "As an adult, I should be able to watch what I want within the law—and if the viewer is a child, that responsibility belongs to their parents, not a corporation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube did not respond to multiple requests to comment and so far has not acknowledged Gerfdas' petition. But Gerfdas is hoping that enough backlash may force YouTube to rethink its AI age checks, telling Ars that "even if they don’t respond right away, we’ll keep making noise until they do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adult YouTubers defend childish viewing habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ars monitored, hundreds of self-described YouTubers joined Gerfdas' petition hourly. Gerfdas told Ars the petition's popularity suggested that "this isn’t just a YouTube issue." As age checks become more commonplace across the Internet due to regulatory pressure globally, people motivated to defend digital freedom are balking and increasingly banding together, Gerfdas said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;"To a lot of people, this feels like mass surveillance and censorship under the banner of 'protecting kids,'" Gerfdas told Ars. "People want a free, open Internet without having their activities constantly tracked or filtered."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For YouTubers signing Gerfdas' petition, the pressure is on to disrupt age-verification trends that, experts told Ars, risk exposing vulnerable users who rely on anonymity to use YouTube. That includes queer YouTubers, one of whom commented that sharing their ID or selfie to appeal an AI age check would "absolutely be putting myself in danger."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious question for critics is how a YouTube watch history could possibly be a reliable age indicator, especially since many adults are nostalgic for childhood content on YouTube. One commenter, Estelle, said that she "relies on childish and silly content to get through the rough days" as a person with disabilities. Videos like "toy unboxings" or "silly animations" offer one way "to literally cope in a world that doesn’t want me in it," she wrote, noting that "nobody asked for" some "weird dumb robot policing" YouTubers for loving videos made for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commenters with autism suggested that they may be specifically targeted by the AI system since their special interests may be perceived by AI as "childish." Others identified as parents wondering how the AI system might interpret moments when their child uses a shared account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy experts have criticized YouTube's lack of transparency on its AI age-estimation system, noting that YouTube has not shared any external research verifying the model's effectiveness. One YouTuber signing Gerfdas' petition, Karina, pointed out a recent Discord mishap in which a 30-year-old was flagged as underage, while noting that AI age checks on other platforms haven't been that reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;"I'm autistic," Karina wrote. "It's not fun being a grown woman and being treated like a child because of your interests." Further, "the first rule of Internet safety is to never give out your personal information online, because it's so easy for it to get stolen," Karina said. "It's concerning that YouTube somehow thinks that this is a good idea."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressing distrust in YouTube's AI was a common theme throughout the petition, as well as expressing distrust in YouTube's motives in launching the AI system. One commenter, Ananda, fumed, "This new policy is all about data mining to get rid of anonymity on the Internet once and for all. The Internet should not be a sanitized corporate theme park where everything is monetized and moralized."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another particularly grumpy commenter summed up criticism of YouTube's AI age checks, writing, "We're not living in a dystopia. We're living in Earth. I refuse to give ID or identification to watch damn videos."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Gerfdas, it's likely hard not to be sympathetic to another group of commenters signing the petition—teen content creators who don't want AI to restrict their YouTube activity. Gerfdas started watching YouTube at 13, eventually starting a channel as an adult in 2023 after being heavily influenced by favorite content creators Gerfdas grew up watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, Gerfdas told Ars, YouTube would end the AI age-check experiment and keep the prior system, while maintaining efforts with YouTube Kids to help parents restrict children's viewing. Although Gerfdas partly depends on the platform for income, if YouTube launched the AI system platform-wide, Gerfdas said then it might be time to "seriously" consider leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We cannot allow YouTube to quietly implement AI surveillance that violates privacy and autonomy," Gerfdas' Change.org petition said. "Once these systems are normalized, they rarely go away—they expand. If we don't speak up now, we risk losing our ability to browse, create, and enjoy content freely. This is about more than YouTube. This is about digital freedom."&lt;/p&gt;
