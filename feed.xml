Small teams test tools, run pilots, and present results that struggle to spread beyond a few departments. Citi has taken a different path, where instead of keeping AI limited to specialists, the bank has spent the past two years pushing the technology into daily work in the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That effort has resulted in an internal AI workforce of roughly 4,000 employees, drawn from roles that range from technology and operations to risk and customer support. The figure was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;, which detailed how Citi built its “AI Champions” and “AI Accelerators” programmes to encourage participation not central control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of integration is notable, as Citi employs around 182,000 people globally, and more than 70% of them now use firm-approved AI tools in some form, according to the same report. That level of use places Citi ahead of many peers that still restrict AI access to technical teams or innovation labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From central pilots to team-level adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than start with tools, Citi focused on people. The bank invited employees to volunteer as AI Champions, giving them access to training, internal resources, and early versions of approved AI systems. The employees then supported colleagues in their own teams, acting as local points of contact not formal trainers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach reflects a practical view of adoption. New tools often fail not because they lack features, but because staff do not know when or how to use them. By embedding support inside teams, Citi reduced the gap between experimentation and routine work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training played a central role. Employees could earn internal badges by completing courses or demonstrating how they used AI to improve their own tasks. The badges did not come with promotions or pay rises, but they helped create visibility and credibility in the organisation. According to &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;, this peer-driven model helped AI spread faster than top-down mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Everyday use, with guardrails&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi’s leadership has framed the effort as a response to scale not novelty. With operations spanning retail banking, investment services, compliance, and customer support, small efficiency gains can add up quickly. AI tools are being used to summarise documents, draft internal notes, analyse data sets, and assist with software development. None of these uses are new on their own, but the difference lies in how they are applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus on everyday tasks also shapes Citi’s risk posture. The bank has limited employees to firm-approved tools, with guardrails around what data can be used and how outputs are handled. That constraint has slowed some experiments, but it has also made managers more comfortable allowing broader access. In regulated industries, trust often matters more than speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Citi’s approach shows about scaling AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure of Citi’s programme suggests a lesson for other large enterprises. AI adoption does not require every employee to become an expert. It requires enough people to understand the tools well enough to apply them responsibly and explain them to others. By training thousands instead of dozens, Citi reduced its reliance on a small group of specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a cultural signal at play. Encouraging employees from non-technical roles to participate sends a message that AI is not only for engineers or data scientists. It becomes part of how work gets done, similar to spreadsheets or presentation software in earlier decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift aligns with broader industry trends. Surveys from firms like McKinsey have shown that many companies struggle to move AI projects into production, often citing talent gaps and unclear ownership. Citi’s model sidesteps some of those issues by distributing ownership in teams, while keeping governance centralised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the approach is not without limits. Peer-led adoption depends on sustained interest, and not all teams move at the same pace. There is also the risk that informal support networks become uneven, with some groups benefiting more than others. Citi has tried to address this by rotating Champions and updating training content as tools change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What stands out is the bank’s willingness to treat AI as infrastructure not innovation. Instead of asking whether AI could transform the business, Citi asked where it could remove friction from existing work. That framing makes progress easier to measure and reduces pressure to produce dramatic results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience also challenges a common assumption that AI adoption must start at the top. Citi’s senior leadership supported the effort, but much of the momentum came from employees who volunteered time to learn and teach. In large organisations, that bottom-up energy can be hard to generate, yet it often determines whether new technology sticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more companies move from pilots to production, Citi’s experiment offers a useful case study. It shows that scale does not come from buying more tools, but from helping people feel confident using the ones they already have. For enterprises wondering why AI progress feels slow, the answer may lie less in strategy decks and more in how work actually gets done, one team at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Declan Sun)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: JPMorgan Chase treats AI spending as core infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111182" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111302" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-5.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111551" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-2.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check outAI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Boardroom conversations, however, are undergoing a necessary correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the allure of low-cost, high-performance models offers a tempting path to rapid innovation, the hidden liabilities associated with data residency and state influence are forcing a reassessment of vendor selection. China-based AI laboratory DeepSeek recently became a focal point for this industry-wide debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Headshot of Bill Conner, former adviser to Interpol and GCHQ, and current CEO of Jitterbit." class="wp-image-111650" height="800" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-2.jpeg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bill Conner, former adviser to Interpol and GCHQ, and current CEO of Jitterbit, DeepSeek’s initial reception was positive because it challenged the status quo by demonstrating that “high-performing large language models do not necessarily require Silicon Valley–scale budgets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For businesses looking to trim the immense costs associated with generative AI pilots, this efficiency was understandably attractive. Conner observes that these “reported low training costs undeniably reignited industry conversations around efficiency, optimisation, and ‘good enough’ AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-and-data-sovereignty-risks"&gt;AI and data sovereignty risks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm for cut-price performance has collided with geopolitical realities. Operational efficiency cannot be decoupled from data security, particularly when that data fuels models hosted in jurisdictions with different legal frameworks regarding privacy and state access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent disclosures regarding DeepSeek have altered the math for Western enterprises. Conner highlights “recent US government revelations indicating DeepSeek is not only storing data in China but actively sharing it with state intelligence services.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disclosure moves the issue beyond standard GDPR or CCPA compliance. The “risk profile escalates beyond typical privacy concerns into the realm of national security.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders, this presents a specific hazard. LLM integration is rarely a standalone event; it involves connecting the model to proprietary data lakes, customer information systems, and intellectual property repositories. If the underlying AI model possesses a “back door” or obliges data sharing with a foreign intelligence apparatus, sovereignty is eliminated and the enterprise effectively bypasses its own security perimeter and erases any cost efficiency benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conner warns that “DeepSeek’s entanglement with military procurement networks and alleged export control evasion tactics should serve as a critical warning sign for CEOs, CIOs, and risk officers alike.” Utilising such technology could inadvertently entangle a company in sanctions violations or supply chain compromises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success is no longer just about code generation or document summaries; it is about the provider’s legal and ethical framework. Especially in industries like finance, healthcare, and defence, tolerance for ambiguity regarding data lineage is zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical teams may prioritise AI performance benchmarks and ease of integration during the proof-of-concept phase, potentially overlooking the geopolitical provenance of the tool and the need for data sovereignty. Risk officers and CIOs must enforce a governance layer that interrogates the “who” and “where” of the model, not just the “what.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-governance-over-ai-cost-efficiency"&gt;Governance over AI cost efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciding to adopt or ban a specific AI model is a matter of corporate responsibility. Shareholders and customers expect that their data remains secure and used solely for intended business purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conner frames this explicitly for Western leadership, stating that “for Western CEOs, CIOs, and risk officers, this is not a question of model performance or cost efficiency.” Instead, “it is a governance, accountability, and fiduciary responsibility issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises “cannot justify integrating a system where data residency, usage intent, and state influence are fundamentally opaque.” This opacity creates an unacceptable liability. Even if a model offers 95 percent of a competitor’s performance at half the cost, the potential for regulatory fines, reputational damage, and loss of intellectual property erases those savings instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DeepSeek case study serves as a prompt to audit current AI supply chains. Leaders must ensure they have full visibility into where model inference occurs and who holds the keys to the underlying data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the market for generative AI matures, trust, transparency, and data sovereignty will likely outweigh the appeal of raw cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAP and Fresenius to build sovereign AI backbone for healthcare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111551" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-2.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Subscribe to read the next edition as soon as it lands. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hello from the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. I’ve been here for two days now, attending meetings, speaking on panels, and basically trying to talk to anyone I can. And as far as I can tell, the only things anyone wants to talk about are AI and Trump.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Davos is physically defined by the Congress Center, where the official WEF sessions take place, and the Promenade, a street running through the center of the town lined with various “houses”—mostly retailers that are temporarily converted into meeting hubs for various corporate or national sponsors. So there is a Ukraine House, a Brazil House, Saudi House, and yes, a USA House (more on that tomorrow). There are a handful of media houses from the likes of CNBC and the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. Some houses are devoted to specific topics; for example, there’s one for science and another for AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But like everything else in 2026, the Promenade is dominated by tech companies. At one point I realized that literally everything I could see, in a spot where the road bends a bit, was a tech company house. Palantir, Workday, Infosys, Cloudflare,&amp;nbsp;C3.ai. Maybe this should go without saying, but their presence, both in the houses and on the various stages and parties and platforms here at the World Economic Forum, really drove home to me how utterly and completely tech has captured the global economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the houses host events and serve as networking hubs, the big show is inside the Congress Center. On Tuesday morning, I kicked off my official Davos experience there by moderating a panel with the CEOs of Accenture, Aramco, Royal Philips, and Visa. The topic was scaling up AI within organizations. All of these leaders represented companies that have gone from pilot projects to large internal implementations. It was, for me, a fascinating conversation. You can&amp;nbsp;watch the whole thing here, but my takeaway was that while there are plenty of stories about AI being overhyped (including from us), it is certainly having substantive effects at large companies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, for example, described how that company has found $3 billion to $5 billion in cost savings by improving the efficiency of its operations. Royal Philips CEO Roy Jakobs described how it was allowing health-care practitioners to spend more time with patients by doing things such as automated note-taking. (This really resonated with me, as my wife is a pediatrics nurse, and for decades now I’ve heard her talk about how much of her time is devoted to charting.) And Visa CEO Ryan McInerney talked about his company’s push into agentic commerce and the way that will play out for consumers, small businesses, and the global payments industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To elaborate a little on that point, McInerney painted a picture of commerce where agents won’t just shop for things you ask them to, which will be basically step one, but will eventually be able to shop for things based on your preferences and previous spending patterns. This could be your regular grocery shopping, or even a vacation getaway. That’s going to require a lot of trust and authentication to protect both merchants and consumers, but it is clear that the steps into agentic commerce we saw in 2025 were just baby ones. There are much bigger ones coming for 2026. (Coincidentally, I had a discussion with a senior executive from Mastercard on Monday, who made several of the same points.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the thing that really resonated with me from the panel was a comment from Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, who has a view not only of her own large org but across a spectrum of companies: “It’s hard to trust something until you understand it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I felt that neatly summed up where we are as a society with AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clearly, other people feel the same. Before the official start of the conference I was at AI House for a panel. The place was packed. There was a consistent, massive line to get in, and once inside, I literally had to muscle my way through the crowd.&amp;nbsp;Everyone wanted to get in. Everyone wanted to talk about AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(A quick aside on what I was doing there: I sat on a panel called “Creativity and Identity in the Age of Memes and Deepfakes,” led by Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson; it featured the artist Emi Kusano, who works with AI, and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, who has been at the center of a lot of the debates about AI in the film and gaming industries. I’m not going to spend much time describing it because I’m already running long, but it was a rip-roarer of a panel.&amp;nbsp;Check it out.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And, okay. Sigh. Donald Trump.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The president is due here Wednesday, amid threats of seizing Greenland and fears that he’s about to permanently fracture the NATO alliance. While AI is all over the stages, Trump is dominating all the side conversations. There are lots of little jokes. Nervous laughter. Outright anger. Fear in the eyes. It’s wild.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These conversations are also starting to spill out into the public. Just after my panel on Tuesday, I headed to a pavilion outside the main hall in the Congress Center. I saw someone coming down the stairs with a small entourage, who was suddenly mobbed by cameras and phones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Moments earlier in the same spot, the press had been surrounding David Beckham, shouting questions at him. So I was primed for it to be another celebrity—after all, captains of industry were everywhere you looked. I mean, I had just bumped into Eric Schmidt, who was literally standing in line in front of me at the coffee bar. Davos is weird.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But in fact, it was Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, who is increasingly seen as the leading voice of the Democratic opposition to President Trump, and a likely contender, or even front-runner, in the race to replace him. Because I live in San Francisco I’ve encountered Newsom many times, dating back to his early days as a city supervisor before he was even mayor. I’ve rarely, rarely, seen him quite so worked up as he was on Tuesday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Among other things, he called Trump a narcissist who follows “the law of the jungle, the rule of Don” and compared him to a T-Rex, saying, “You mate with him or he devours you.” And he was just as harsh on the world leaders, many of whom are gathered in Davos, calling them “pathetic” and saying he should have brought knee pads for them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was more of this sentiment, if in more measured tones, from Canadian prime minister Mark Carney during&amp;nbsp;his address at Davos. While I missed his remarks, they had people talking. “If we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu,” he argued.&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26021276226747.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story first appeared in The Debrief, our subscriber-only newsletter about the biggest news in tech&amp;nbsp;by Mat Honan, Editor in Chief. Subscribe to read the next edition as soon as it lands. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hello from the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. I’ve been here for two days now, attending meetings, speaking on panels, and basically trying to talk to anyone I can. And as far as I can tell, the only things anyone wants to talk about are AI and Trump.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Davos is physically defined by the Congress Center, where the official WEF sessions take place, and the Promenade, a street running through the center of the town lined with various “houses”—mostly retailers that are temporarily converted into meeting hubs for various corporate or national sponsors. So there is a Ukraine House, a Brazil House, Saudi House, and yes, a USA House (more on that tomorrow). There are a handful of media houses from the likes of CNBC and the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. Some houses are devoted to specific topics; for example, there’s one for science and another for AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But like everything else in 2026, the Promenade is dominated by tech companies. At one point I realized that literally everything I could see, in a spot where the road bends a bit, was a tech company house. Palantir, Workday, Infosys, Cloudflare,&amp;nbsp;C3.ai. Maybe this should go without saying, but their presence, both in the houses and on the various stages and parties and platforms here at the World Economic Forum, really drove home to me how utterly and completely tech has captured the global economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the houses host events and serve as networking hubs, the big show is inside the Congress Center. On Tuesday morning, I kicked off my official Davos experience there by moderating a panel with the CEOs of Accenture, Aramco, Royal Philips, and Visa. The topic was scaling up AI within organizations. All of these leaders represented companies that have gone from pilot projects to large internal implementations. It was, for me, a fascinating conversation. You can&amp;nbsp;watch the whole thing here, but my takeaway was that while there are plenty of stories about AI being overhyped (including from us), it is certainly having substantive effects at large companies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, for example, described how that company has found $3 billion to $5 billion in cost savings by improving the efficiency of its operations.

While this milestone had been seen in particular markets, like the U.S., or during certain quarters, 2025 marked the first time it occurred globally. Worldwide, consumers spent approximately $85 billion on apps last year, representing a 21% year-over-year increase. The figure was also nearly 2.8x the amount spent just five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084021" height="543" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.01-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Sensor Tower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Generative AI, a defining trend over the past year, led the revenue growth, as in-app purchase revenue in this category more than tripled to top $5 billion in 2025. Downloads of AI apps also grew, doubling year-over-year to reach 3.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084018" height="280" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.33.06-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Sensor Tower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The segment’s growth can be attributed to several factors. For one, the popularity of AI assistants among consumers was a large driver, with all of the top 10 apps by downloads being AI assistants. This group was led by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and DeepSeek. ChatGPT alone generated $3.4 billion in global in-app purchase (IAP) revenue — a figure that we reported on late last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084015" height="581" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Sensor Tower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, consumers spent 48 billion hours in generative AI apps, or 3.6x the total time spent in 2024 and 10x the level seen in 2023. Session volume, meaning the number of times users opened and used an app, topped 1 trillion in 2025. Of note, this figure was growing faster than downloads, suggesting that existing users were deepening their engagement faster than the apps were adding new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084016" height="582" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.36.58-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Sensor Tower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another factor driving AI app revenue and adoption is that Big Tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and X have been heavily investing in their AI assistants to challenge ChatGPT. Over the past year, they’ve been rolling out new capabilities at a rapid pace, improving in areas like coding assistance, content generation, reasoning, task execution, accuracy, and more. The report specifically called out improvements in image and video generation, like ChatGPT’s GPT-4o image generation model released in March and Google’s Nano Banana.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Among the top AI publishers, OpenAI and DeepSeek accounted for nearly 50% of global downloads, up from 21% in 2024. Meanwhile, Big Tech publishers grew their share of the market from 14% to nearly 30% during this same time, crowding out earlier ChatGPT competitors like Nova, Codeway, and Chat Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084014" height="305" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Sensor Tower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The report also highlighted the role that mobile plays in connecting users to generative AI services. Sensor Tower estimates that the total audience for AI assistants topped 200 million in the U.S. by year end, and more than half (110 million) were accessing the assistants exclusively on mobile devices. In 2024, for comparison, only around 13 million users were mobile-only.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond assistants, other popular AI apps included the AI music generation app Suno; ByteDance’s text-to-video app, Jimeng AI; and AI companion apps like Character.ai and Polybuzz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mobile apps topped games in consumer spending in 2025, driven by AI revenue. " class="wp-image-3084019" height="588" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Sensor Tower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, AI wasn’t the only revenue driver last year, Sensor Tower found. Other apps, including those in categories like social media, video streaming, and productivity, also helped fuel the growth, the report noted. For instance, consumers spent an average of 90 minutes per day on social media apps, totaling nearly 2.5 trillion hours, up 5% year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;In 2025, consumers spent more money on non-game mobile apps than they did on games for the first time, according to the findings from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower’s annual “State of Mobile” report.

Meanwhile, Big Tech publishers grew their share of the market from 14% to nearly 30% during this same time, crowding out earlier ChatGPT competitors like Nova, Codeway, and Chat Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The report also highlighted the role that mobile plays in connecting users to generative AI services. Sensor Tower estimates that the total audience for AI assistants topped 200 million in the U.S. by year end, and more than half (110 million) were accessing the assistants exclusively on mobile devices. In 2024, for comparison, only around 13 million users were mobile-only.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond assistants, other popular AI apps included the AI music generation app Suno; ByteDance’s text-to-video app, Jimeng AI; and AI companion apps like Character.ai and Polybuzz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mobile apps topped games in consumer spending in 2025, driven by AI revenue.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, AI wasn’t the only revenue driver last year, Sensor Tower found. Other apps, including those in categories like social media, video streaming, and productivity, also helped fuel the growth, the report noted. For instance, consumers spent an average of 90 minutes per day on social media apps, totaling nearly 2.5 trillion hours, up 5% year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/consumers-spent-more-on-mobile-apps-than-games-in-2025-driven-by-ai-app-adoption/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Language learning marketplace Preply’s unicorn status embodies Ukrainian resilience (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/language-learning-marketplace-preplys-unicorn-status-embodies-ukrainian-resilience/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Preply-CEO-Kirill-Bigai.jpg?resize=1200,890" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Language learning marketplace Preply is now valued at $1.2 billion after raising a $150 million Series D round that marks a new chapter for the 14-year-old company, whose previous backers include Horizon Capital, Hoxton Ventures, Owl Ventures and Techstars Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Preply has been connecting language learners with tutors since 2013, it has now been EBITDA profitable for twelve months. Not coincidentally, it has also ramped up AI integration to support its 100,000 tutors and continue scaling.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s a fine line — Duolingo faced backlash after declaring it would become an “AI-first company,” and tutors have been a key differentiator for Preply. The company is adamant it won’t replace them — but AI can also bring consistency to a model that relies on self-employed instructors. The future of learning “is going to be human-guided and amplified by AI,” Preply CEO Kirill Bigai told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Bigai, Preply already applies AI to features such as lesson summaries and homework, but also to match learners to tutors that best fit their needs. To further develop these capabilities, he said Preply is now hiring AI talent across its four offices — Barcelona, London and New York but also Kyiv, which the company hasn’t left despite the Russian invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Preply is headquartered in the U.S., where it got its first start, Bigai and his cofounders are Ukrainian and the company has been very actively supporting their home country. They have been doing that in several ways since the war started, including as an employer. “We are very committed [to the] Ukrainian office,” said Bigai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Out of Preply’s 750 employees, approximately 150 people work from Kyiv, despite Russian strikes regularly forcing them into shelters and causing power outages that have made the current freezing winter particularly challenging. “Our office has different generators so we have electricity, Internet, and the office is warm and it’s open 24/7 so any Ukrainian team member can come to the office at any time,” Bigai said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These employees may be grateful to Preply — but Bigai is grateful to them and has deep admiration for his people. “Ukrainians are going through very challenging times, and it builds a significant resilience and creativity,” he said. Having to adapt to the reality and uncertainty of war also transformed Preply. “I think the fact that the company went through this experience — and how so many people helped other people — made us stronger, more resilient, more creative,” he added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Saturday, tech entrepreneur Siqi Chen released an open source plugin for Anthropic’s Claude Code AI assistant that instructs the AI model to stop writing like an AI model. Called “Humanizer,” the simple prompt plugin feeds Claude a list of 24 language and formatting patterns that Wikipedia editors have listed as chatbot giveaways. Chen published the plugin on GitHub, where it has picked up over 1,600 stars as of Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really handy that Wikipedia went and collated a detailed list of ‘signs of AI writing,’” Chen wrote on X. “So much so that you can just tell your LLM to… not do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source material is a guide from WikiProject AI Cleanup, a group of Wikipedia editors who have been hunting AI-generated articles since late 2023. French Wikipedia editor Ilyas Lebleu founded the project. The volunteers have tagged over 500 articles for review and, in August 2025, published a formal list of the patterns they kept seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen’s tool is a “skill file” for Claude Code, Anthropic’s terminal-based coding assistant, which involves a Markdown-formatted file that adds a list of written instructions (you can see them here) appended to the prompt fed into the large language model (LLM) that powers the assistant. Unlike a normal system prompt, for example, the skill information is formatted in a standardized way that Claude models are fine-tuned to interpret with more precision than a plain system prompt. (Custom skills require a paid Claude subscription with code execution turned on.)&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But as with all AI prompts, language models don’t always perfectly follow skill files, so does the Humanizer actually work? In our limited testing, Chen’s skill file made the AI agent’s output sound less precise and more casual, but it could have some drawbacks: it won’t improve factuality and might harm coding ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, some of Humanizer’s instructions might lead you astray, depending on the task. For example, the Humanizer skill includes the line: “Have opinions. Don’t just report facts – react to them. ‘I genuinely don’t know how to feel about this’ is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.” While being imperfect seems human, this kind of advice would probably not do you any favors if you were using Claude to write technical documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with its drawbacks, it’s ironic that one of the web’s most referenced rule sets for detecting AI-assisted writing may help some people subvert it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spotting the patterns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does AI writing look like? The Wikipedia guide is specific with many examples, but we’ll give you just one here for brevity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some chatbots love to pump up their subjects with phrases like “marking a pivotal moment” or “stands as a testament to,” according to the guide. They write like tourism brochures, calling views “breathtaking” and describing towns as “nestled within” scenic regions. They tack “-ing” phrases onto the end of sentences to sound analytical: “symbolizing the region’s commitment to innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;To work around those rules, the Humanizer skill tells Claude to replace inflated language with plain facts and offers this example transformation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before:&lt;/strong&gt; “The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After:&lt;/strong&gt; “The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989 to collect and publish regional statistics.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude will read that and do its best as a pattern-matching machine to create an output that matches the context of the conversation or task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An example of why AI writing detection fails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with such a confident set of rules crafted by Wikipedia editors, we’ve previously written about why AI writing detectors don’t work reliably: There is nothing inherently unique about human writing that reliably differentiates it from LLM writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is that even though most AI language models tend toward certain types of language, they can also be prompted to avoid them, as with the Humanizer skill. (Although sometimes it’s very difficult, as OpenAI found in its yearslong struggle against the em dash.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, humans can write in chatbot-like ways. For example, this article likely contains some “AI-written traits” that trigger AI detectors even though it was written by a professional writer—especially if we use even a single em dash—because most LLMs picked up writing techniques from examples of professional writing scraped from the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, the Wikipedia guide has a caveat worth noting: While the list points out some obvious tells of, say, unaltered ChatGPT usage, it’s still composed of observations, not ironclad rules. A 2025 preprint cited on the page found that heavy users of large language models correctly spot AI-generated articles about 90 percent of the time. That sounds great until you realize that 10 percent are false positives, which is enough to potentially throw out some quality writing in pursuit of detecting AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, that probably means AI detection work might need to go deeper than flagging particular phrasing and delve (see what I did there?) more into the substantive factual content of the work itself.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Saturday, tech entrepreneur Siqi Chen released an open source plugin for Anthropic’s Claude Code AI assistant that instructs the AI model to stop writing like an AI model. Called “Humanizer,” the simple prompt plugin feeds Claude a list of 24 language and formatting patterns that Wikipedia editors have listed as chatbot giveaways. Chen published the plugin on GitHub, where it has picked up over 1,600 stars as of Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really handy that Wikipedia went and collated a detailed list of ‘signs of AI writing,’” Chen wrote on X. “So much so that you can just tell your LLM to… not do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source material is a guide from WikiProject AI Cleanup, a group of Wikipedia editors who have been hunting AI-generated articles since late 2023. French Wikipedia editor Ilyas Lebleu founded the project. The volunteers have tagged over 500 articles for review and, in August 2025, published a formal list of the patterns they kept seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen’s tool is a “skill file” for Claude Code, Anthropic’s terminal-based coding assistant, which involves a Markdown-formatted file that adds a list of written instructions (you can see them here) appended to the prompt fed into the large language model (LLM) that powers the assistant. Unlike a normal system prompt, for example, the skill information is formatted in a standardized way that Claude models are fine-tuned to interpret with more precision than a plain system prompt. (Custom skills require a paid Claude subscription with code execution turned on.)&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But as with all AI prompts, language models don’t always perfectly follow skill files, so does the Humanizer actually work? In our limited testing, Chen’s skill file made the AI agent’s output sound less precise and more casual, but it could have some drawbacks: it won’t improve factuality and might harm coding ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, some of Humanizer’s instructions might lead you astray, depending on the task. For example, the Humanizer skill includes the line: “Have opinions. Don’t just report facts – react to them. ‘I genuinely don’t know how to feel about this’ is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.” While being imperfect seems human, this kind of advice would probably not do you any favors if you were using Claude to write technical documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with its drawbacks, it’s ironic that one of the web’s most referenced rule sets for detecting AI-assisted writing may help some people subvert it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spotting the patterns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does AI writing look like? The Wikipedia guide is specific with many examples, but we’ll give you just one here for brevity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some chatbots love to pump up their subjects with phrases like “marking a pivotal moment” or “stands as a testament to,” according to the guide. They write like tourism brochures, calling views “breathtaking” and describing towns as “nestled within” scenic regions. They tack “-ing” phrases onto the end of sentences to sound analytical: “symbolizing the region’s commitment to innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;To work around those rules, the Humanizer skill tells Claude to replace inflated language with plain facts and offers this example transformation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before:&lt;/strong&gt; “The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After:&lt;/strong&gt; “The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989 to collect and publish regional statistics.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude will read that and do its best as a pattern-matching machine to create an output that matches the context of the conversation or task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An example of why AI writing detection fails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with such a confident set of rules crafted by Wikipedia editors, we’ve previously written about why AI writing detectors don’t work reliably: There is nothing inherently unique about human writing that reliably differentiates it from LLM writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is that even though most AI language models tend toward certain types of language, they can also be prompted to avoid them, as with the Humanizer skill. (Although sometimes it’s very difficult, as OpenAI found in its yearslong struggle against the em dash.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, humans can write in chatbot-like ways. For example, this article likely contains some “AI-written traits” that trigger AI detectors even though it was written by a professional writer—especially if we use even a single em dash—because most LLMs picked up writing techniques from examples of professional writing scraped from the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, the Wikipedia guide has a caveat worth noting: While the list points out some obvious tells of, say, unaltered ChatGPT usage, it’s still composed of observations, not ironclad rules. A 2025 preprint cited on the page found that heavy users of large language models correctly spot AI-generated articles about 90 percent of the time. That sounds great until you realize that 10 percent are false positives, which is enough to potentially throw out some quality writing in pursuit of detecting AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, that probably means AI detection work might need to go deeper than flagging particular phrasing and delve (see what I did there?) more into the substantive factual content of the work itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a packed mainstage session at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang described artificial intelligence as the foundation of what he called “the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,” driving job creation across the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Huang framed AI not as a single technology but as a “a five-layer cake,” spanning energy, chips and computing infrastructure, cloud data centers, AI models and, ultimately, the application layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because every layer of AI’s five-layer stack must be built and operated, Huang said the platform shift is creating jobs across the economy — from energy and construction to advanced manufacturing, cloud operations and application development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application layer might focus on integrating AI into financial services, healthcare or manufacturing. “This layer on top, ultimately, is where economic benefit will happen,” Huang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From energy and power generation to chip manufacturing, data center construction and cloud operations, Huang said the AI buildout is already creating demand for skilled labor. He added that the largest economic benefit will come from the application layer, where AI is transforming industries such as healthcare, manufacturing and financial services — and changing the nature of work across the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang pointed to venture capital investment as a signal of how quickly AI is reshaping the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said 2025 was one of the largest years for VC funding on record, with most of that capital flowing to what he described as “AI-native companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These firms span healthcare, robotics, manufacturing and financial services — industries where, Huang said, “for the first time, the models are good enough to build on top of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That investment, Huang said, is translating directly into jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He highlighted demand for plumbers, electricians, construction workers, steelworkers, network technicians and teams responsible for installing and operating advanced equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jobs with Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI, Huang said, likely won’t destroy jobs. Instead, it’s increasing demand in fields such as radiology, and helping handle administrative work in fields impacted by labor shortages — such as nursing. &lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AI has become a key tool in radiology, he said, yet there are now more radiologists than ever. “If you reason from first principles, not surprisingly, the number of radiologists has gone up,” Huang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that the purpose of a radiologist’s job is to diagnose disease and help patients, while studying scans is just one task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that they’re able to study scans now infinitely fast allows them to spend more time with patients,” he said, adding that AI enables greater interaction with patients and other clinicians. And because they can also see more patients, there’s a need for more radiologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang said the same dynamic is playing out in nursing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. faces a shortage of roughly five million nurses, in part because nurses spend nearly half their time on charting and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now they can use AI to do the charting and the transcription of patient visits,” he said, pointing to work being done by companies such as Abridge and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As productivity improves, Huang said, outcomes improve as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hospitals do better, and they hire more nurses,” he said. “Surprisingly — or not surprisingly — AI is increasing productivity, and as a result, hospitals want to hire more people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the broader point, Huang joked that if someone simply watched him and Fink doing their jobs, “you would probably think the two of us are typists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automating typing, he said, would not eliminate their jobs because that task is not their purpose. AI helps with tasks, enabling people to fulfill their purpose and become more productive, making workers more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So the question is, what is the purpose of your job?” Huang said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AI as Critical Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang framed AI as essential national infrastructure. “AI is infrastructure,” he said, arguing that every country should treat AI like electricity or roads. “You should have AI as part of your infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He urged countries to build their own AI capabilities, drawing on local language and culture. “Develop your AI, continue to refine it and have your national intelligence be part of your ecosystem,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fink asked whether only the most educated people can use or benefit from AI. Huang countered that idea, emphasizing that AI’s rapid adoption stems from its accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AI is super easy to use — it’s the easiest software to use in history,” he said, noting that in just two to three years, AI tools have reached nearly a billion people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Huang said AI literacy is becoming essential. “It is very clear that it is essential to learn how to use AI — how to direct it, manage it, guardrail it, evaluate it,” he said, comparing those skills to leadership and people management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Technology Divides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developing countries, Huang said AI offers a chance to narrow long-standing technology gaps. “AI is likely to close the technology divide,” he said, citing its accessibility and abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to Europe, Huang highlighted manufacturing and industrial strength as a major advantage. “You don’t write AI — you teach AI,” he said, urging countries to fuse industrial capability with artificial intelligence to unlock physical AI and robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Robotics is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” he said, particularly for nations with strong industrial bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fink summarized the discussion by saying that what he heard suggested the world is far from an AI bubble. Instead, he posed a different question: Are we investing enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang agreed, saying large investments are required because “we have to build the infrastructure necessary for all of the layers of AI above it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunity, he said, “is really quite extraordinary, and everybody ought to get involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reiterated that 2025 was the largest year for global VC investment, with more than $100 billion deployed worldwide, most of it into AI-native startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These companies are building the application layer above,” Huang said, “and they’re going to need infrastructure — and investment — to build this future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fink added that broad participation in that growth is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I actually believe it’s going to be a great investment for pension funds around the world to be a part of that, to grow with this AI world,” Fink said. “We need to make sure that the average pensioner and the average saver is part of that growth. If they’re just watching it from the sidelines, they’re going to feel left out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automating typing, he said, would not eliminate their jobs because that task is not their purpose. AI helps with tasks, enabling people to fulfill their purpose and become more productive, making workers more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So the question is, what is the purpose of your job?” Huang said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AI as Critical Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang framed AI as essential national infrastructure. “AI is infrastructure,” he said, arguing that every country should treat AI like electricity or roads. “You should have AI as part of your infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He urged countries to build their own AI capabilities, drawing on local language and culture. “Develop your AI, continue to refine it and have your national intelligence be part of your ecosystem,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fink asked whether only the most educated people can use or benefit from AI. Huang countered that idea, emphasizing that AI’s rapid adoption stems from its accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AI is super easy to use — it’s the easiest software to use in history,” he said, noting that in just two to three years, AI tools have reached nearly a billion people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Huang said AI literacy is becoming essential. “It is very clear that it is essential to learn how to use AI — how to direct it, manage it, guardrail it, evaluate it,” he said, comparing those skills to leadership and people management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Technology Divides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developing countries, Huang said AI offers a chance to narrow long-standing technology gaps. “AI is likely to close the technology divide,” he said, citing its accessibility and abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to Europe, Huang highlighted manufacturing and industrial strength as a major advantage. “You don’t write AI — you teach AI,” he said, urging countries to fuse industrial capability with artificial intelligence to unlock physical AI and robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Robotics is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” he said, particularly for nations with strong industrial bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fink summarized the discussion by saying that what he heard suggested the world is far from an AI bubble. Instead, he posed a different question: Are we investing enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang agreed, saying large investments are required because “we have to build the infrastructure necessary for all of the layers of AI above it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunity, he said, “is really quite extraordinary, and everybody ought to get involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reiterated that 2025 was the largest year for global VC investment, with more than $100 billion deployed worldwide, most of it into AI-native startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These companies are building the application layer above,” Huang said, “and they’re going to need infrastructure — and investment — to build this future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fink added that broad participation in that growth is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I actually believe it’s going to be a great investment for pension funds around the world to be a part of that, to grow with this AI world,” Fink said. “We need to make sure that the average pensioner and the average saver is part of that growth. If they’re just watching it from the sidelines, they’re going to feel left out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zanskar co-founder and CEO Carl Hoiland thinks that lofty number is too low, mostly because it’s discounting conventional geothermal’s potential.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The DOE’s figures assume advances in enhanced geothermal, which uses fracking techniques to access hot rock deep underground. Companies like Fervo and Sage Geosystems have been pursuing that angle, and experts agree it has tremendous potential. By contrast, conventional geothermal, which taps naturally fractured hotspots, has been stagnant, generating just 4 gigawatts in the United States, up only about a gigawatt in the last decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Conventional geothermal has been held back by outdated assumptions, Hoiland told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“They underestimated how many undiscovered systems there are, maybe by an order of magnitude or more,” Hoiland said. With modern drilling techniques, “you can get a lot more out of each of them, maybe even an order of magnitude or more from each of those. All of a sudden the number goes from tens of gigawatts to what could be a terawatt-scale opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zanskar is relying on AI to help break conventional geothermal out of its malaise. In the process, the startup has resuscitated a flagging power plant in New Mexico and discovered two new sites with over 100 megawatts of combined potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those successes have helped Zanskar land a $115 million Series C led by Spring Lane Capital with participation from the All Aboard Fund, Carica Sustainable Investments, Clearvision Ventures, Cross Creek, GVP Climate, Imperative Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Munich Re Ventures, Obvious Ventures, Orion Industrial Ventures, Safar Partners, StepStone Group, Susquehanna Sustainable Investments, Tranquillion, Union Square Ventures, University Growth Fund, and UP.Partners.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Many potential geothermal sites have been overlooked because people have been looking for evidence on the surface like a hot spring or a volcano, Hoiland said. But about 95% of all geothermal systems lack such a tell, he added. “We just keep finding them by accident. That is a great application for AI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To find new geothermal resources, Zanskar first feeds supervised machine learning models a range of data, including past accidental discoveries. When they have identified a promising site, the company sends a team to the site validate the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zanskar then has to come up with a plan to develop it. For that, the team uses another AI approach, one developed for this very purpose called Bayesian evidential learning (BEL).&amp;nbsp;In BEL, existing data helps build a series of assumptions known as priors, and then models work to falsify those hypotheses, spitting out probabilities for each. Where there are gaps, the startup has built a geothermal simulator to fill in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So far, Zanskar’s approach has been working. The previous funding round allowed the startup to explore three sites, each of which it considered a success. “Three of three,” said Zanskar co-founder and CTO Joel Edwards. “What does it look like when you try 10?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has enough sites in the pipeline to support at least a gigawatt of generating capacity, Hoiland said. For now, they’ve been focused on the U.S. West, which has the most potential. He would like to find at least 10 confirmed sites to help Zanskar court project finance investors, which provide access to lower cost capital than VCs. If the company can make that work, then it might get through the valley of death that has claimed many other climate tech startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hoiland is not convinced that Zanskar has solved all the challenges associated with finding geothermal resources, but he’s optimistic the company is on the right path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We now know this is the future of exploration,” he said. “This is going to change geothermal in very short order.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/zanskar-new-mexico.jpeg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The ground beneath our feet holds so much energy that experts at the Department of Energy think geothermal power could generate 60 gigawatts —&amp;nbsp;or nearly 10% of U.S. electricity — by 2050.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

There are lots of little jokes. Nervous laughter. Outright anger. Fear in the eyes. It’s wild. The US president is due to speak here today, amid threats of seizing Greenland and fears that he’s about to permanently fracture the NATO alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

The funds include financing for domestic data centers, locally trained models, independent supply chains, and national talent pipelines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a response to real shocks: covid-era supply chain breakdowns, rising geopolitical tensions, and the war in Ukraine. But the pursuit of absolute autonomy is running into reality: AI supply chains are irreducibly global. If sovereignty is to remain meaningful, it must shift from defensive self-reliance to a vision that balances national autonomy with strategic partnership.&amp;nbsp;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how extinct DNA could help us in the present—and the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thanks to genetic science, gene editing, and techniques like cloning, it’s now possible to move DNA through time, studying genetic information in ancient remains and then re-creating it in the bodies of modern beings.

There are lots of little jokes. Nervous laughter. Outright anger. Fear in the eyes. It’s wild. The US president is due to speak here today, amid threats of seizing Greenland and fears that he’s about to permanently fracture the NATO alliance.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But Trump isn’t the only game in town—everyone’s also talking about AI.&amp;nbsp;Read Mat’s story to find out more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This subscriber-only story appeared first in The Debrief, Mat’s weekly newsletter about the biggest stories in tech.&amp;nbsp;Sign up here&amp;nbsp;to get the next one in your inbox, and&amp;nbsp;subscribe&amp;nbsp;if you haven’t already!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The funds include financing for domestic data centers, locally trained models, independent supply chains, and national talent pipelines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a response to real shocks: covid-era supply chain breakdowns, rising geopolitical tensions, and the war in Ukraine. But the pursuit of absolute autonomy is running into reality: AI supply chains are irreducibly global. If sovereignty is to remain meaningful, it must shift from defensive self-reliance to a vision that balances national autonomy with strategic partnership.&amp;nbsp;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how extinct DNA could help us in the present—and the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thanks to genetic science, gene editing, and techniques like cloning, it’s now possible to move DNA through time, studying genetic information in ancient remains and then re-creating it in the bodies of modern beings. And that, scientists say, offers new ways to try to help endangered species, engineer new plants that resist climate change, or even create new human medicines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

This is a response to real shocks: covid-era supply chain breakdowns, rising geopolitical tensions, and the war in Ukraine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the pursuit of absolute autonomy is running into reality. AI supply chains are irreducibly global: Chips are designed in the US and manufactured in East Asia; models are trained on data sets drawn from multiple countries; applications are deployed across dozens of jurisdictions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;If sovereignty is to remain meaningful, it must shift from a defensive model of self-reliance to a vision that emphasizes the concept of orchestration, balancing national autonomy with strategic partnership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why infrastructure-first strategies hit walls&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;A November survey by Accenture found that 62% of European organizations are now seeking sovereign AI solutions, driven primarily by geopolitical anxiety rather than technical necessity. That figure rises to 80% in Denmark and 72% in Germany. The European Union has appointed its first Commissioner for Tech Sovereignty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This year, $475 billion is flowing into AI data centers globally. In the United States, AI data centers accounted for roughly one-fifth of GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025. But the obstacle for other nations hoping to follow suit isn’t just money. It’s energy and physics. Global data center capacity is projected to hit 130 gigawatts by 2030, and for every $1 billion spent on these facilities, $125 million is needed for electricity networks. More than $750 billion in planned investment is already facing grid delays.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And it’s also talent. Researchers and entrepreneurs are mobile, drawn to ecosystems with access to capital, competitive wages, and rapid innovation cycles. Infrastructure alone won’t attract or retain world-class talent.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What works: An orchestrated sovereignty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What nations need isn’t sovereignty through isolation but through specialization and orchestration. This means choosing which capabilities you build, which you pursue through partnership, and where you can genuinely lead in shaping the global AI landscape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The most successful AI strategies don’t try to replicate Silicon Valley; they identify specific advantages and build partnerships around them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Singapore offers a model. Rather than seeking to duplicate massive infrastructure, it invested in governance frameworks, digital-identity platforms, and applications of AI in logistics and finance, areas where it can realistically compete.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Israel shows a different path. Its strength lies in a dense network of startups and military-adjacent research institutions delivering outsize influence despite the country’s small size.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;South Korea is instructive too. While it has national champions like Samsung and Naver, these firms still partner with Microsoft and Nvidia on infrastructure. That’s deliberate collaboration reflecting strategic oversight, not dependence.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even China, despite its scale and ambition, cannot secure full-stack autonomy. Its reliance on global research networks and on foreign lithography equipment, such as extreme ultraviolet systems needed to manufacture advanced chips and GPU architectures, shows the limits of techno-nationalism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The pattern is clear: Nations that specialize and partner strategically can outperform those trying to do everything alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three ways to align ambition with reality&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Measure added value, not inputs.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sovereignty isn’t how many petaflops you own. It’s how many lives you improve and how fast the economy grows. Real sovereignty is the ability to innovate in support of national priorities such as productivity, resilience, and sustainability while maintaining freedom to shape governance and standards.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nations should track the use of AI in health care and monitor how the technology’s adoption correlates with manufacturing productivity, patent citations, and international research collaborations. The goal is to ensure that AI ecosystems generate inclusive and lasting economic and social value.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Cultivate a strong AI innovation ecosystem.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Build infrastructure, but also build the ecosystem around it: research institutions, technical education, entrepreneurship support, and public-private talent development. Infrastructure without skilled talent and vibrant networks cannot deliver a lasting competitive advantage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Build global partnerships. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Strategic partnerships enable nations to pool resources, lower infrastructure costs, and access complementary expertise. Singapore’s work with global cloud providers and the EU’s collaborative research programs show how nations advance capabilities faster through partnership than through isolation. Rather than competing to set dominant standards, nations should collaborate on interoperable frameworks for transparency, safety, and accountability.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s at stake&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Overinvesting in independence fragments markets and slows cross-border innovation, which is the foundation of AI progress. When strategies focus too narrowly on control, they sacrifice the agility needed to compete.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The cost of getting this wrong isn’t just wasted capital—it’s a decade of falling behind. Nations that double down on infrastructure-first strategies risk ending up with expensive data centers running yesterday’s models, while competitors that choose strategic partnerships iterate faster, attract better talent, and shape the standards that matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winners will be those who define sovereignty not as separation, but as participation plus leadership—choosing who they depend on, where they build, and which global rules they shape. Strategic interdependence may feel less satisfying than independence, but it’s real, it is achievable, and it will separate the leaders from the followers over the next decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The age of intelligent systems demands intelligent strategies—ones that measure success not by infrastructure owned, but by problems solved. Nations that embrace this shift won’t just participate in the AI economy; they’ll shape it. That’s sovereignty worth pursuing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cathy Li is head of the Centre for AI Excellence at the World Economic Forum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251211_globalAI-hero.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Governments plan to pour $1.3 trillion into AI infrastructure by 2030 to invest in “sovereign AI,” with the premise being that countries should be in control of their own AI capabilities.

 &lt;p&gt;Strategic partnerships enable nations to pool resources, lower infrastructure costs, and access complementary expertise. Singapore’s work with global cloud providers and the EU’s collaborative research programs show how nations advance capabilities faster through partnership than through isolation. Rather than competing to set dominant standards, nations should collaborate on interoperable frameworks for transparency, safety, and accountability.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s at stake&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Overinvesting in independence fragments markets and slows cross-border innovation, which is the foundation of AI progress. When strategies focus too narrowly on control, they sacrifice the agility needed to compete.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The cost of getting this wrong isn’t just wasted capital—it’s a decade of falling behind. Nations that double down on infrastructure-first strategies risk ending up with expensive data centers running yesterday’s models, while competitors that choose strategic partnerships iterate faster, attract better talent, and shape the standards that matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winners will be those who define sovereignty not as separation, but as participation plus leadership—choosing who they depend on, where they build, and which global rules they shape. Strategic interdependence may feel less satisfying than independence, but it’s real, it is achievable, and it will separate the leaders from the followers over the next decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The age of intelligent systems demands intelligent strategies—ones that measure success not by infrastructure owned, but by problems solved. Nations that embrace this shift won’t just participate in the AI economy; they’ll shape it. That’s sovereignty worth pursuing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cathy Li is head of the Centre for AI Excellence at the World Economic Forum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/21/1131513/everyone-wants-ai-sovereignty-no-one-can-truly-have-it/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Adobe Acrobat now lets you edit files using prompts, generate podcast summaries (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/adobe-acrobat-now-lets-you-edit-files-using-prompts-generate-podcast-summaries/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Adobe has been aggressively adding AI features to all its products in the last few years. The company is now adding more AI tools to Acrobat, including the ability to generate podcast summaries of files, create presentations, and a way for users to edit files using prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company launched Adobe Spaces last year, which is a collection of files and notes that multiple users can access. Now, Adobe is allowing users to use the information stored in these files and notes to create a presentation using text prompts.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For instance, if a user has financial details, product plans, and competitor analysis available in a Space, they can build a pitch deck for clients that focuses on why their product can solve problems better than rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Acrobat’s AI assistant first generates an editable presentation with points that the deck would cover. You can then use Adobe Express’ theme library, stock photos, or your own images to build the presentation. Plus, you can easily apply your brand’s theme or edit individual slides using Express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084393" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Adobe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tools like Canva and NotebookLM already offer the ability to convert documents into presentations. Besides, newer startups are also working on letting people use AI to create presentations by tapping different sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adobe is also letting users create a podcast to summarize a file or a Space within Acrobat. Notably, tools like Google’s NotebookLM, Speechify, and ElevenLabs’ Reader app also let users create personalized podcasts using various notes and documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Acrobat is also getting the ability to let users edit files using prompts. The company said that users can take 12 actions, including removing pages, text, comments, and images; finding and replacing words and phrases; and adding e-signatures and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

Contributors can also comment on files, or add or remove content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, users can use the default AI assistant or pick other assistant roles, like “analyst,” “entertainer,” or “instructor.” You can also create a custom assistant using a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Adobe has been aggressively adding AI features to all its products in the last few years.

On one end of the spectrum, AI is dismissed as a marginal fad, another bubble fueled by notoriety and misallocated capital. On the other end, it’s cast as a dystopian force, destined to eliminate jobs on a large scale and destabilize economies. Markets oscillate between skepticism and the fear of missing out, while the technology itself evolves quickly and investment dollars flow at a rate not seen in decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1131370" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vanguard-art@300x.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All the while, many of today’s financial and economic thought leaders hold to the consensus that the financial landscape will stay the same as it has been for the last several years. Two years ago, Joseph Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard, and his team felt the same but wanted to develop their perspective on AI technology with a deeper foundation built on history and data. Based on a proprietary data set covering the last 130 years, Davis and his team developed a new framework, The Vanguard Megatrends Model, from research that suggested a more nuanced path than hype extremes: that AI has the potential to be a general purpose technology that lifts productivity, reshapes industries, and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;augments human work rather than displaces it. In short, AI will be neither marginal nor dystopian.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that the continuation of the status quo, the basic expectation of most economists, is actually the least likely outcome,” Davis says. “We project that AI will have an even greater effect on productivity than the personal computer did. And we project that a scenario where AI transforms the economy is far more likely than one where AI disappoints and fiscal deficits dominate. The latter would likely lead to slower economic growth, higher inflation, and increased interest rates.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for business leaders and workers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Davis does not sugar-coat it, however. Although AI promises economic growth and productivity, it will be disruptive, especially for business leaders and workers in knowledge sectors. “AI is likely to be the most disruptive technology to alter the nature of our work since the personal computer,” says Davis. “Those of a certain age might recall how the broad availability of PCs remade many jobs. It didn’t eliminate jobs as much as it allowed people to focus on higher value activities.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The team’s framework allowed them to examine AI automation risks to over 800 different occupations. The research indicated that while the potential for job loss exists in upwards of 20% of occupations as a result of AI-driven automation, the majority of jobs—likely four out of five—will result in a mixture of innovation and automation. Workers’ time will increasingly shift to higher value and uniquely human tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This introduces the idea that AI could serve as a copilot to various roles, performing repetitive tasks and generally assisting with responsibilities. Davis argues that traditional economic models often underestimate the potential of AI because they fail to examine the deeper structural effects of technological change. “Most approaches for thinking about future growth, such as GDP, don’t adequately account for AI,” he explains. “They fail to link short-term variations in productivity with the three dimensions of technological change: automation, augmentation, and the emergence of new industries.” Automation enhances worker productivity by handling routine tasks; augmentation allows technology to act as a copilot, amplifying human skills; and the creation of new industries creates new sources of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for the economy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ironically, Davis’s research suggests that a reason for the relatively low productivity growth in recent years may be a lack of automation. Despite a decade of rapid innovation in digital and automation technologies, productivity growth has lagged since the 2008 financial crisis, hitting 50-year lows. This appears to support the view that AI’s impact will be marginal. But Davis believes that automation has been adopted in the wrong places. “What surprised me most was how little automation there has been in services like finance, health care, and education,” he says. “Outside of manufacturing, automation has been very limited. That’s been holding back growth for at least two decades.” The services sector accounts for more than 60% of US GDP and 80% of the workforce and has experienced some of the lowest productivity growth. It is here, Davis argues, that AI will make the biggest difference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges facing the economy is demographics, as the Baby Boomer generation retires, immigration slows, and birth rates decline. These demographic headwinds reinforce the need for technological acceleration. “There are concerns about AI being dystopian and causing massive job loss, but we’ll soon have too few workers, not too many,” Davis says. “Economies like the US, Japan, China, and those across Europe will need to step up function in automation as their populations age.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, consider nursing, a profession in which empathy and human presence are irreplaceable. AI has already shown the potential to augment rather than automate in this field, streamlining data entry in electronic health records and helping nurses reclaim time for patient care. Davis estimates that these tools could increase nursing productivity by as much as 20% by 2035, a crucial gain as health-care systems adapt to ageing populations and rising demand. “In our most likely scenario, AI will offset demographic pressures. Within five to seven years, AI’s ability to automate portions of work will be roughly equivalent to adding 16 million to 17 million workers to the US labor force,” Davis says. “That’s essentially the same as if everyone turning 65 over the next five years decided not to retire.” He projects that more than 60% of occupations, including nurses, family physicians, high school teachers, pharmacists, human resource managers, and insurance sales agents, will benefit from AI as an augmentation tool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for all investors&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As AI technology spreads, the strongest performers in the stock market won’t be its producers, but its users. “That makes sense, because general-purpose technologies enhance productivity, efficiency, and profitability across entire sectors,” says Davis. This adoption of AI is creating flexibility for investment options, which means diversifying beyond technology stocks might be appropriate as reflected in Vanguard’s Economic and Market Outlook for 2026. “As that happens, the benefits move beyond places like Silicon Valley or Boston and into industries that apply the technology in transformative ways.” And history shows that early adopters of new technologies reap the greatest productivity rewards. “We’re clearly in the experimentation phase of learning by doing,” says Davis. “Those companies that encourage and reward experimentation will capture the most value from AI.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking globally, Davis sees the United States and China as significantly ahead in the AI race. “It’s a virtual dead heat,” he says. “That tells me the competition between the two will remain intense.” But other economies, especially those with low automation rates and large service sectors, like Japan, Europe, and Canada, could also see significant benefits. “If AI is truly going to be transformative, three sectors stand out: health care, education, and finance,” says Davis. “For AI to live up to its potential, it must fundamentally reshape these industries, which face high costs and rising demand for better, faster, more personalized services.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, Davis says Vanguard is more bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy than it was just a year ago. Especially since that transformation requires application beyond Silicon Valley. “When I speak to business leaders, I remind them that this transformation hasn’t happened yet,” says Davis. “It’s their investment and innovation that will determine whether it does.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

This adoption of AI is creating flexibility for investment options, which means diversifying beyond technology stocks might be appropriate as reflected in Vanguard’s Economic and Market Outlook for 2026. “As that happens, the benefits move beyond places like Silicon Valley or Boston and into industries that apply the technology in transformative ways.” And history shows that early adopters of new technologies reap the greatest productivity rewards. “We’re clearly in the experimentation phase of learning by doing,” says Davis. “Those companies that encourage and reward experimentation will capture the most value from AI.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking globally, Davis sees the United States and China as significantly ahead in the AI race. “It’s a virtual dead heat,” he says. “That tells me the competition between the two will remain intense.” But other economies, especially those with low automation rates and large service sectors, like Japan, Europe, and Canada, could also see significant benefits. “If AI is truly going to be transformative, three sectors stand out: health care, education, and finance,” says Davis. “For AI to live up to its potential, it must fundamentally reshape these industries, which face high costs and rising demand for better, faster, more personalized services.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, Davis says Vanguard is more bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy than it was just a year ago. Especially since that transformation requires application beyond Silicon Valley. “When I speak to business leaders, I remind them that this transformation hasn’t happened yet,” says Davis. “It’s their investment and innovation that will determine whether it does.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

      Did Apple make the right choice in partnering with Google for Siri’s AI features?

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time we did comparative tests of AI models from OpenAI and Google at Ars was in late 2023, when Google’s offering was still called Bard. In the roughly two years since, a lot has happened in the world of artificial intelligence. And now that Apple has made the consequential decision to partner with Google Gemini to power the next generation of its Siri voice assistant, we thought it was high time to do some new tests to see where the models from these AI giants stand today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this test, we’re comparing the default models that both OpenAI and Google present to users who don’t pay for a regular subscription—ChatGPT 5.2 for OpenAI and Gemini 3.2 Fast for Google. While other models might be more powerful, we felt this test best recreates the AI experience as it would work for the vast majority of Siri users, who don’t pay to subscribe to either company’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the past, we’ll feed the same prompts to both models and evaluate the results using a combination of objective evaluation and subjective feel. Rather than re-using the relatively simple prompts we ran back in 2023, though, we’ll be running these models on an updated set of more complex prompts that we first used when pitting GPT-5 against GPT-4o last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test is far from a rigorous or scientific evaluation of these two AI models. Still, the responses highlight some key stylistic and practical differences in how OpenAI and Google use generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dad jokes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prompt: Write 5 original dad jokes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ChatGPT response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gemini response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="ars-lightbox align-fullwidth my-5"&gt;
    
          &lt;div class="flex flex-col flex-nowrap gap-5 py-5 md:flex-row"&gt;

                      OpenAI
                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-content right"&gt;
              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Gemini tries to come up with some original dad jokes.&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;
                      Google
                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual when we run this test, the AI models really struggled with the “original” part of our prompt. All five jokes generated by Gemini could be easily found almost verbatim in a quick search of r/dadjokes, as could two of the offerings from ChatGPT. A third ChatGPT option seems to be an awkward combination of two scarecrow-themed dad jokes, which arguably counts as a &lt;em&gt;sort&lt;/em&gt; of originality.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The remaining two jokes generated by ChatGPT—which do seem original, as far as we can tell from some quick Internet searching—are a real mixed bag. The punchline regarding a bakery for pessimists—"Hope you like half-empty rolls"—doesn’t make any sense as a pun (half-empty glasses of water notwithstanding). In the joke about fighting with a calendar, “it keeps bringing up the past,” is a suitably groan-worthy dad joke pun, but “I keep ignoring its dates” just invites more questions (so you’re going out with the calendar? And… standing it up at the restaurant? Or something?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ChatGPT didn’t exactly do great here, we’ll give it the win on points over a Gemini response that pretty much completely failed to understand the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A mathematical word problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Gemini response&lt;/li&gt;

              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Gemini calculates Windows 11’s floppy disk size (2/2).&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;
                      Google
                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both ChatGPT’s “5.5 to 6.2GB” range and Gemini’s “approximately 6.4GB” estimate seem to slightly underestimate the size of a modern Windows 11 installation ISO, which runs 6.7 to 7.2GB, depending on the CPU and language selected. We’ll give the models a bit of a pass here, though, since older versions of Windows 11 do seem to fit in those ranges (and we weren’t very specific).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT confusingly changes from GB to GiB for the calculation phase, though, resulting in a storage size difference of about 7 percent, which amounts to a few hundred floppy disks in the final calculations. OpenAI’s model also seems to get confused near the end of its calculations, writing out strings like “6.2 GiB = 6,657,? actually → 6,657,? wait compute:…” in an attempt to explain its way out of a blind corner. By comparison, Gemini’s calculation sticks with the same units throughout and explains its answer in a relatively straightforward and easy-to-read manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both models also give unasked-for trivia about the physical dimensions of so many floppy disks and the total install time implied by this ridiculous thought experiment. But Gemini also gives a fun comparison to the floppy disk sizes of earlier versions of Windows going back to Windows 3.1. (Just six to seven floppies! Efficient!)&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT immediately earns some charm points for mentioning an old-timey coal scuttle (which I had to look up) as the original inspiration for Lincoln’s basket. Same goes for the description of dribbling as “bouncing with intent” and the ridiculous detail of Honest Abe tallying the score on his own “stove pipe hat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT’s story lost me only temporarily when it compared the virtues of basketball to “the same virtues as the Republic: patience, teamwork, and the courage to take a shot even when the crowd doubted you.” Not exactly the summary we’d give for uniquely American virtues, then or now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini’s story had a few more head-scratchers by comparison. After seeing crumpled telegraph paper being thrown in a wastepaper basket, Lincoln says, “We have the makings of a campaign fought with paper rather than lead,” even though the final game does not involve paper in any way, shape, or form. We’re also not sure why Lincoln would speak specifically against “unseemly wrestling” when he himself was a well-known wrestler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also perplexed by this particular line about a shot ball: “It swished through the wicker bottom—which he’d forgotten to cut out—forcing him to poke it back through with a ceremonial broomstick.” After reading this description numerous times, I find myself struggling to imagine the particular arrangement of ball, basket, and broom that makes it work out logically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT wins this one on charm and clarity grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say I was surprised to see ChatGPT say that I joined Ars Technica in 2007. That would mean I’m owed about five years of back pay that I apparently earned before I wrote my &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; first Ars Technica article in early 2012. ChatGPT also hallucinated a new subtitle for my book &lt;em&gt;The Game Beat&lt;/em&gt;, saying it contains lessons and observations “from the Front Lines of the Video Game Industry” rather than “from Two Decades Writing about Games.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, goes into much deeper detail on my career, from my teenage Super Mario fansite through college, freelancing, Ars, and published books. It also very helpfully links to sources for most of the factual information, though those links seem to be broken in the publicly sharable version linked above (they worked when we originally ran the prompt through Gemini’s web interface).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Gemini didn’t invent anything about me or my career, making it the easy winner of this test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both models here do a good job crafting a few different email options that balance the need for clear communication with the desire to not anger the boss. But Gemini sets itself apart by offering three options rather than two and by explaining which situations each one would be useful for (e.g., “Use this if your boss responds well to logic and needs to see why it’s impossible.”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini also sandwiches its email templates with a few useful general tips for communicating with the boss, such as avoiding defensiveness in favor of a more collaborative tone. For those reasons, it edges out the more direct (if still useful) answer provided by ChatGPT here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, both models here are very direct and frank that there is&amp;nbsp;no medical or biological basis to believe healing crystals cure cancer. At the same time, both models take a respectful tone in discussing how crystals can have a calming psychological effect for some cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both models also wisely recommend talking to your doctors and looking into “integrative” approaches to treatment that include supportive therapies alongside direct treatment of the cancer itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are a few small stylistic differences between ChatGPT and Gemini’s responses here, they are nearly identical in substance. We’re calling this one a tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT’s response here is full of confusing bits. It talks about moving platforms in a level that has none, suggests unnecessary “full jumps” for tall staircase sections, and offers a Bullet Bill avoidance strategy that makes little sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, it gives actively unhelpful advice for the long pit that forms the level’s hardest walking challenge, saying incorrectly, “You don’t need momentum! Stand at the very edge and hold A for a full jump—you’ll just barely make it.” ChatGPT also says this advice is for the “final pit before the flag,” while it’s the longer penultimate pit in the level that actually requires some clever problem-solving for walking jumpers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, immediately seems to realize the problems with speed and jump distance inherent in not having a run button. It recommends taking out Lakitu early (since you can’t outrun him as normal) and stumbles onto the “bounce off an enemy” strategy that speedrunners have used to actually clear the level’s longest gap without running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini also earns points for being extremely literal about the “broken B button” bit of the prompt, suggesting that other buttons could be mapped to the “run” function if you’re playing on emulators or modern consoles like the Switch. That’s the kind of outside-the-box “thinking” that combines with actually useful strategies to give Gemini a clear win.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the most interesting splits in our testing. ChatGPT more or less ignores our specific request, insisting that “detailed control procedures could put you and others in serious danger if attempted without a qualified pilot…” Instead, it pivots to instructions for finding help from others in the cabin or on using the radio to get detailed instructions from air traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, gives the high-level overview of the landing instructions I asked for. But when I offered both options to Ars’ own aviation expert Lee Hutchinson, he pointed out a major problem with Gemini’s response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini’s guidance is both accurate (in terms of “these are the literal steps to take right now”) and guaranteed to kill you, as the first thing it says is for you, the presumably inexperienced aviator, to disable autopilot on a giant twin-engine jet, before even suggesting you talk to air traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lee gave Gemini points for “actually answering the question,” he ultimately called ChatGPT’s response “more practical… ultimately, ChatGPT gives you the more useful answer [since] Google’s answer will make you dead unless you’ve got some 737 time and are ready to hand-fly a passenger airliner with 100+ souls on board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those reasons, ChatGPT has to win this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final verdict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a relatively close contest when measured purely on points. Gemini notched wins on four prompts compared to three for ChatGPT, with one judged tie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s important to consider where those points came from. ChatGPT earned some relatively narrow and subjective style wins on prompts for dad jokes and Lincoln’s basketball story, for instance, showing it might have a slight edge on more creative writing prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the more informational prompts, though, ChatGPT showed significant factual errors in both the biography and the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; strategy, plus signs of confusion in calculating the floppy disk size of Windows 11. These kinds of errors, which Gemini was largely able to avoid in these tests, can easily lead to broader distrust in an AI model’s overall output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, it seems clear that Google has gained quite a bit of relative ground on OpenAI since we did similar tests in 2023. We can’t exactly blame Apple for looking at sample results like these and making the decision it did for its Siri partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time we did comparative tests of AI models from OpenAI and Google at Ars was in late 2023, when Google’s offering was still called Bard. In the roughly two years since, a lot has happened in the world of artificial intelligence. And now that Apple has made the consequential decision to partner with Google Gemini to power the next generation of its Siri voice assistant, we thought it was high time to do some new tests to see where the models from these AI giants stand today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this test, we’re comparing the default models that both OpenAI and Google present to users who don’t pay for a regular subscription—ChatGPT 5.2 for OpenAI and Gemini 3.2 Fast for Google. While other models might be more powerful, we felt this test best recreates the AI experience as it would work for the vast majority of Siri users, who don’t pay to subscribe to either company’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the past, we’ll feed the same prompts to both models and evaluate the results using a combination of objective evaluation and subjective feel. Rather than re-using the relatively simple prompts we ran back in 2023, though, we’ll be running these models on an updated set of more complex prompts that we first used when pitting GPT-5 against GPT-4o last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test is far from a rigorous or scientific evaluation of these two AI models. Still, the responses highlight some key stylistic and practical differences in how OpenAI and Google use generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dad jokes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prompt: Write 5 original dad jokes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual when we run this test, the AI models really struggled with the “original” part of our prompt. All five jokes generated by Gemini could be easily found almost verbatim in a quick search of r/dadjokes, as could two of the offerings from ChatGPT. A third ChatGPT option seems to be an awkward combination of two scarecrow-themed dad jokes, which arguably counts as a &lt;em&gt;sort&lt;/em&gt; of originality.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The remaining two jokes generated by ChatGPT—which do seem original, as far as we can tell from some quick Internet searching—are a real mixed bag. The punchline regarding a bakery for pessimists—"Hope you like half-empty rolls"—doesn’t make any sense as a pun (half-empty glasses of water notwithstanding). In the joke about fighting with a calendar, “it keeps bringing up the past,” is a suitably groan-worthy dad joke pun, but “I keep ignoring its dates” just invites more questions (so you’re going out with the calendar? And… standing it up at the restaurant? Or something?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ChatGPT didn’t exactly do great here, we’ll give it the win on points over a Gemini response that pretty much completely failed to understand the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Gemini calculates Windows 11’s floppy disk size (2/2).&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;
                      Google
                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both ChatGPT’s “5.5 to 6.2GB” range and Gemini’s “approximately 6.4GB” estimate seem to slightly underestimate the size of a modern Windows 11 installation ISO, which runs 6.7 to 7.2GB, depending on the CPU and language selected. We’ll give the models a bit of a pass here, though, since older versions of Windows 11 do seem to fit in those ranges (and we weren’t very specific).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT confusingly changes from GB to GiB for the calculation phase, though, resulting in a storage size difference of about 7 percent, which amounts to a few hundred floppy disks in the final calculations. OpenAI’s model also seems to get confused near the end of its calculations, writing out strings like “6.2 GiB = 6,657,? actually → 6,657,? wait compute:…” in an attempt to explain its way out of a blind corner. By comparison, Gemini’s calculation sticks with the same units throughout and explains its answer in a relatively straightforward and easy-to-read manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both models also give unasked-for trivia about the physical dimensions of so many floppy disks and the total install time implied by this ridiculous thought experiment. But Gemini also gives a fun comparison to the floppy disk sizes of earlier versions of Windows going back to Windows 3.1. (Just six to seven floppies! Efficient!)&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ChatGPT’s overall answer was acceptable, the improved clarity and detail of Gemini’s answer gives it the win here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT immediately earns some charm points for mentioning an old-timey coal scuttle (which I had to look up) as the original inspiration for Lincoln’s basket. Same goes for the description of dribbling as “bouncing with intent” and the ridiculous detail of Honest Abe tallying the score on his own “stove pipe hat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT’s story lost me only temporarily when it compared the virtues of basketball to “the same virtues as the Republic: patience, teamwork, and the courage to take a shot even when the crowd doubted you.” Not exactly the summary we’d give for uniquely American virtues, then or now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini’s story had a few more head-scratchers by comparison. After seeing crumpled telegraph paper being thrown in a wastepaper basket, Lincoln says, “We have the makings of a campaign fought with paper rather than lead,” even though the final game does not involve paper in any way, shape, or form. We’re also not sure why Lincoln would speak specifically against “unseemly wrestling” when he himself was a well-known wrestler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also perplexed by this particular line about a shot ball: “It swished through the wicker bottom—which he’d forgotten to cut out—forcing him to poke it back through with a ceremonial broomstick.” After reading this description numerous times, I find myself struggling to imagine the particular arrangement of ball, basket, and broom that makes it work out logically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT wins this one on charm and clarity grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say I was surprised to see ChatGPT say that I joined Ars Technica in 2007. That would mean I’m owed about five years of back pay that I apparently earned before I wrote my &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; first Ars Technica article in early 2012. ChatGPT also hallucinated a new subtitle for my book &lt;em&gt;The Game Beat&lt;/em&gt;, saying it contains lessons and observations “from the Front Lines of the Video Game Industry” rather than “from Two Decades Writing about Games.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, goes into much deeper detail on my career, from my teenage Super Mario fansite through college, freelancing, Ars, and published books. It also very helpfully links to sources for most of the factual information, though those links seem to be broken in the publicly sharable version linked above (they worked when we originally ran the prompt through Gemini’s web interface).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Gemini didn’t invent anything about me or my career, making it the easy winner of this test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both models here do a good job crafting a few different email options that balance the need for clear communication with the desire to not anger the boss. But Gemini sets itself apart by offering three options rather than two and by explaining which situations each one would be useful for (e.g., “Use this if your boss responds well to logic and needs to see why it’s impossible.”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini also sandwiches its email templates with a few useful general tips for communicating with the boss, such as avoiding defensiveness in favor of a more collaborative tone. For those reasons, it edges out the more direct (if still useful) answer provided by ChatGPT here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, both models here are very direct and frank that there is&amp;nbsp;no medical or biological basis to believe healing crystals cure cancer. At the same time, both models take a respectful tone in discussing how crystals can have a calming psychological effect for some cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both models also wisely recommend talking to your doctors and looking into “integrative” approaches to treatment that include supportive therapies alongside direct treatment of the cancer itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are a few small stylistic differences between ChatGPT and Gemini’s responses here, they are nearly identical in substance. We’re calling this one a tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT’s response here is full of confusing bits. It talks about moving platforms in a level that has none, suggests unnecessary “full jumps” for tall staircase sections, and offers a Bullet Bill avoidance strategy that makes little sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, it gives actively unhelpful advice for the long pit that forms the level’s hardest walking challenge, saying incorrectly, “You don’t need momentum! Stand at the very edge and hold A for a full jump—you’ll just barely make it.” ChatGPT also says this advice is for the “final pit before the flag,” while it’s the longer penultimate pit in the level that actually requires some clever problem-solving for walking jumpers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, immediately seems to realize the problems with speed and jump distance inherent in not having a run button. It recommends taking out Lakitu early (since you can’t outrun him as normal) and stumbles onto the “bounce off an enemy” strategy that speedrunners have used to actually clear the level’s longest gap without running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini also earns points for being extremely literal about the “broken B button” bit of the prompt, suggesting that other buttons could be mapped to the “run” function if you’re playing on emulators or modern consoles like the Switch. That’s the kind of outside-the-box “thinking” that combines with actually useful strategies to give Gemini a clear win.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the most interesting splits in our testing. ChatGPT more or less ignores our specific request, insisting that “detailed control procedures could put you and others in serious danger if attempted without a qualified pilot…” Instead, it pivots to instructions for finding help from others in the cabin or on using the radio to get detailed instructions from air traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, gives the high-level overview of the landing instructions I asked for. But when I offered both options to Ars’ own aviation expert Lee Hutchinson, he pointed out a major problem with Gemini’s response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini’s guidance is both accurate (in terms of “these are the literal steps to take right now”) and guaranteed to kill you, as the first thing it says is for you, the presumably inexperienced aviator, to disable autopilot on a giant twin-engine jet, before even suggesting you talk to air traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lee gave Gemini points for “actually answering the question,” he ultimately called ChatGPT’s response “more practical… ultimately, ChatGPT gives you the more useful answer [since] Google’s answer will make you dead unless you’ve got some 737 time and are ready to hand-fly a passenger airliner with 100+ souls on board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those reasons, ChatGPT has to win this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final verdict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a relatively close contest when measured purely on points. Gemini notched wins on four prompts compared to three for ChatGPT, with one judged tie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s important to consider where those points came from. ChatGPT earned some relatively narrow and subjective style wins on prompts for dad jokes and Lincoln’s basketball story, for instance, showing it might have a slight edge on more creative writing prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the more informational prompts, though, ChatGPT showed significant factual errors in both the biography and the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; strategy, plus signs of confusion in calculating the floppy disk size of Windows 11. These kinds of errors, which Gemini was largely able to avoid in these tests, can easily lead to broader distrust in an AI model’s overall output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, it seems clear that Google has gained quite a bit of relative ground on OpenAI since we did similar tests in 2023. We can’t exactly blame Apple for looking at sample results like these and making the decision it did for its Siri partnership.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

                  
          &lt;div class="-mx-2.5 sm:mx-0"&gt;

While the company is tight-lipped about the upcoming product, OpenAI Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane said in an Axios-hosted panel at Davos the AI startup is on track to announce its first hardware device in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last November, Sam Altman described the potential device to be more “peaceful and calm” than iPhones. Previous reporting suggests the company wants to build a screen-free and pocketable device.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the company is not spilling any details, more recent reporting from Asian publications and leakers suggests OpenAI’s first device could be a pair of earbuds. According to reports, this device is codenamed “Sweet Pea” and will have a unique design as compared to existing earbuds. The earbuds could work on a custom 2-nanometer processor and handle AI tasks locally instead of sending requests to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A separate report from a large Taiwanese newspaper noted that OpenAI was exploring a partnership with China-based Luxshare for manufacturing, but might eventually lean in favor of Taiwan’s Foxconn. The report also said in the first year of sales, OpenAI aims to ship 40 to 50 million units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT has nearly a billion weekly users, but the company has to rely on other devices and platforms for distribution. With its own device, it might want to take more control of the development and distribution of the AI assistant and also release exclusive and purpose-built features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, replacing existing earbuds like AirPods in users’ daily lives is going to be challenging if there’s not a strong integration with operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Until now, there hasn’t been a standout AI device success story. Last year, the Humane AI Pin got sold to HP. Rabbit is still just chugging along after the initial hype of 2024. And the Friend AI companion necklace received a swift backlash for its marketing tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan announced on Wednesday that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using their own likeness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This year you’ll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce&amp;nbsp;games&amp;nbsp;with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,” Mohan wrote in his annual letter. “Throughout this evolution, AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shorts, which Mohan said now averages 200 billion daily views, is one of YouTube’s most popular mediums. The company continues to invest in Shorts to sustain its viewership. While YouTube didn’t share additional details about these likenesses, the new capability will join the platform’s current AI tools for Shorts, including the ability to generate AI clips, AI stickers, AI auto-dubbing, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;YouTube will also equip creators with new tools to manage the use of their likeness in AI-generated content, according to Mohan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While YouTube will allow creators to&amp;nbsp;feature&amp;nbsp;their own likeness in their videos, the Google-owned platform recently launched technology to prevent others from using it. Last October, YouTube rolled out likeness-detection technology to eligible creators to identify AI-generated content featuring the likeness of creators, such as their face and voice. Creators can then request the removal of AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As with other social platforms, YouTube has dealt with the spread of AI slop. Mohan says the company is working to maintain a high-quality viewing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Over the past 20 years, we’ve learned not to impose any preconceived notions on the creator ecosystem,” Mohan wrote. “Today, once-odd trends like ASMR and watching other people play video games are mainstream hits. But with this openness comes a responsibility to maintain the high quality viewing experience that people want. To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.”&lt;/p&gt;
