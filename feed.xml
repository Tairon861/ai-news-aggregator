&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The commitment, unveiled at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Friday, will target startups across artificial intelligence, healthcare, defense technology, fintech, and consumer technology. The announcement marks a significant increase from the $500 million to $1 billion the firm had previously earmarked for India.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India, the world’s most populous country with more than a billion internet users, is positioning itself as a major AI investment destination. New Delhi aims to attract over $200 billion in AI infrastructure investments over the next two years as it hosts the India AI Impact Summit with participation from companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“India will build the next generation of global platform companies,” General Catalyst CEO Hemant Taneja (pictured above) said, adding that the firm sees Indian founders as uniquely positioned to develop technology for markets serving enormous populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;General Catalyst said it sees India’s biggest AI opportunity in large-scale real-world deployment rather than in building so-called frontier models. The firm cited the country’s government-built digital infrastructure, vast domestic market, and deep services talent pool as reasons for that view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The push comes as India’s AI ambitions accelerate. At the summit, conglomerates Adani Group and Reliance Industries, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, announced plans to invest more than $200 billion combined to build AI data center infrastructure in the country. OpenAI has separately partnered with Tata Group’s TCS — one of India’s largest tech companies — to develop a 100-megawatt AI data center as part of the expansion of its Stargate infrastructure project. In recent months, global tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have also outlined tens of billions of dollars in cloud and AI investments in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;General Catalyst has been building its India portfolio across fast delivery e-commerce, health tech, and deep tech, with investments including Zepto, PB Health, Raphe, Jeh Aerospace, Pronto, and Ayr Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This investment allows us to operate at a different scale in India,” Neeraj Arora, General Catalyst’s CEO for India, the Middle East, and North Africa, said, adding that the firm aims to support companies from early stage through to the public markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;General Catalyst said it is developing a framework to accelerate large-scale AI adoption across priority sectors in India, aiming to help convert pilot projects into full deployments. The firm’s General Catalyst Institute has also been working to build government-industry partnerships in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-605683074-e1729770670902.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;General Catalyst, a Silicon Valley-based venture firm with more than $43 billion in assets under management, has announced it plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next five years, sharply expanding its push into the country’s startup ecosystem less than two years after merging with local venture firm Venture Highway.&lt;/p&gt;

Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London. Most of those affected are children under the age of 11. One in five have needed&amp;nbsp;hospital treatment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. &lt;/strong&gt;Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines—the World Health Organization described it as one of the 10 leading threats to global health in 2019. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people will always argue that measles is not a big deal&lt;/strong&gt;—that infections used to be common, and most people survived them and did just fine. It is true that in most cases kids do recover well from the virus. But not always.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms tend to start with a fever and a runny nose. The telltale rash comes later. In some cases, severe complications develop. They can include pneumonia, blindness, and inflammation of the brain. Some people won’t develop complications until years later. In rare cases, the disease can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before the measles vaccine was introduced, in 1963, measles epidemics occurred every two to three years,&amp;nbsp;according to the WHO. Back then, around 2.6 million people died from measles every year. Since it was introduced, the measles vaccine is thought to have prevented almost 59 million deaths.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But vaccination rates have been lagging,&lt;/strong&gt; says Anne Zink, an emergency medicine physician and clinical fellow at the Yale School of Public Health. “We’ve seen a slow decline in people who are willing to get vaccinated against measles for some time,” she says. “As we get more and more people who are at risk because they’re unvaccinated, the higher the chances that the disease can then spread and take off.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates need to be at 95% to prevent measles outbreaks. But rates are well below that level in some regions. Across South Carolina, the proportion of kindergartners who received both doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella, has&amp;nbsp;dropped steadily over the last five years, from 94% in 2020-2021 to 91% in 2024-2025. Some schools in the state have coverage rates as low as 20%, state epidemiologist Linda Bell&amp;nbsp;told reporters last month.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates are low in London, too. Fewer than 70% of children have received both doses of their MMR by the time they turn five, according to&amp;nbsp;the UK Health Security Agency. In some boroughs, vaccination rates are as low as 58%. So perhaps it’s not surprising we’re seeing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The UK is one of six countries to have&amp;nbsp;lost their measles elimination status last month, along with Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. Canada&amp;nbsp;lost its elimination status last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The highly contagious measles could be a bellwether for other vaccine-preventable diseases. Zink is already seeing signs. She points to a case of&amp;nbsp;polio that paralyzed a man in New York in 2022. That happened when rates of polio vaccination were low, she says. “Polio is a great example of … a disease that is primarily asymptomatic, and most people don’t have any symptoms whatsoever, but for the people who do get symptoms, it can be life-threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then there’s mumps&lt;/strong&gt;—another disease the MMR vaccine protects against. It’s another one of those infections that can be symptom-free and harmless in some, especially children, but nasty for others. It can cause a painful swelling of the testes, and other complications include brain swelling and deafness. (From my personal experience of being hospitalized with mumps, I can attest that even “mild” infections are pretty horrible.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mumps is less contagious than measles, so we might expect a delay between an uptick in measles cases and the spread of mumps, says Zink. &lt;strong&gt;But she says that she’s more concerned about hepatitis B.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It lives on surfaces for a long period of time, and if you’re not vaccinated against it and you’re exposed to it as a kid, you’re at a really high risk of developing liver cancer and death,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Zink was formerly chief medical officer of Alaska, a state that in the 1970s had the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. Screening and universal newborn vaccination programs&amp;nbsp;eliminated the virus’s spread.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Public health experts worry that the current US administration’s position on vaccines may contribute to the decline in vaccine uptake. Last month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved&amp;nbsp;changes to childhood vaccination recommendations. The agency no longer recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. The chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel has also&amp;nbsp;questioned broad vaccine recommendations for polio.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even vitamin injections are being refused by parents, says Zink. A shot of vitamin K at birth can help prevent severe bleeding in some babies. But&amp;nbsp;recent research suggests that parents of 5% of newborns are refusing it (up from 2.9% in 2017).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I can’t tell you how many of my pediatric [doctor] friends have told me about having to care for a kiddo in the ICU with … bleeding into their brain because the kid didn’t get vitamin K at birth,” says Zink. “And that can kill kids, [or have] lifelong, devastating, stroke-like symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All this paints a pretty bleak picture for children’s health.&lt;/strong&gt; But things can change. Vaccination can still offer protection to plenty of people at risk of infection. South Carolina’s Department of Public Health is offering&amp;nbsp;free MMR vaccinations to residents at mobile clinics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s easy to think ‘It’s not going to be me,’” says Zink. “Seeing kiddos who don’t have the agency to make decisions [about vaccination] being so sick from vaccine-preventable diseases, to me, is one of the most challenging things of practicing medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

According to Mi-3, the company is changing its focus from “price to persuasion,” with digital platforms, AI, and in-store execution becoming increasingly important in building demand. This reflects a change in consumer brand behaviour as inflation pressures ease and companies seek new strategies to maintain revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means expanding the role of AI in Coca-Cola’s marketing production and decision-making. The company has already experimented with generative AI in creative campaigns and continues testing how automation can help with content creation, campaign planning, and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysis from The Current points out that Coca-Cola has been embedding AI into marketing workflows and scaling its use in creative production and campaign execution. These efforts include using AI tools to generate images, assist with storytelling, and adjust campaigns in channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Testing AI in the marketing pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week’s reporting suggests the company is now testing AI-driven systems that can help automate parts of the advertising process, including drafting scripts or preparing social media content. While these initiatives remain in testing not full rollout, they illustrate how large brands are moving toward more automated marketing pipelines. Instead of relying only on agencies or long creative cycles, companies are exploring ways to shorten the path from concept to campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the past two years, many consumer goods have firms relied on price increases to offset rising costs. As inflation slows in several markets, analysts say that strategy has limits. Growth increasingly depends on persuading consumers to buy more often or choose higher-margin products. AI offers a way to refine that persuasion at scale, using data to shape messages, target audiences, and adjust campaigns in near real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola’s approach fits a wider trend in marketing technology. Generative AI tools have quickly moved from experimental use to regular deployment in large enterprises. According to McKinsey’s 2024 global AI survey, about one-third of organisations already use generative AI in at least one business function, with marketing and sales among the most common areas of adoption. Analysts expect that share to keep rising as companies test automation in creative work and customer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI moves upstream in enterprise strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strikes out in Coca-Cola’s case is how the corporation frames AI not only as a cost-saving tool, but also as part of a broader operating shift. By focusing on persuasion, the company signals that AI’s value lies in shaping demand, not improving efficiency. That includes using AI to analyse consumer behaviour, tailor messaging to different markets, and support local teams with adaptable content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy also reflects a growing tension in the marketing sector. Automation can speed up production and test more campaign ideas, but it also raises questions about creative quality, brand consistency, and the role of human teams. Companies experimenting with AI-generated content must still ensure that messaging aligns with their brand identity and cultural context. For global brands like Coca-Cola, that challenge becomes more complex because campaigns frequently need to work in many regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor shaping this transition is the rapid growth of digital advertising channels. As spending shifts toward social platforms, streaming services, and online retail media, the volume of content required has expanded. AI tools offer a way to produce many versions of ads, test different approaches, and adjust messaging based on performance data. This makes automation appealing not only for cost reasons, but also for speed and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola’s move reflects a broader pattern: AI adoption is moving upstream in business processes. Early deployments frequently centred on analytics or internal automation. Companies are now applying AI in customer-facing functions like marketing strategy, creative development, and campaign management. That change suggests that AI is becoming part of how companies compete for market share, not how they reduce expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm has not indicated that AI will replace creative teams or agencies. Instead, the current direction indicates a hybrid model in which automation handles repetitive or data-heavy tasks while human teams guide brand voice and campaign concepts. Many marketing leaders believe that this blended approach will define the next phase of AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola’s emphasis on persuasion over pricing may impact how other consumer brands approach growth in a post-inflation environment. If AI can assist businesses in more precisely shaping demand, it may minimise reliance on price increases or mass-market campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by James Yarema)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: PepsiCo is using AI to rethink how factories are designed and updated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Across nearly 6,000 verified executives in four countries, AI has delivered modest aggregate shifts in productivity or employment over the past three years. The measured impact reflects the early phases of deployment rather than a failure of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The working paper [PDF], published by the National Bureau of Economic Research and produced by teams from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the Bank of England, the Deutsche Bundesbank and Macquarie University, found that over 90% of firms report no measurable change headcount attributable to AI over the past three years. Given the short time horizon and the concentration of AI use in discrete functions, such incremental rather than transformative effects are consistent with how general purpose technologies have evolved historically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption of AI is widespread. Around 69% of firms are already using some form of AI, led by LLM-based text generation at 41%, data processing via machine learning at 28% and visual content creation at 29%. In the UK, firm-level adoption rose from 61% to 71% across 2025. AI tools are embedded in day-to-day workflows, and although measured impact at firm level often lags adoption, the trend is generally upwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-forward-ai-impact-numbers-indicate-acceleration"&gt;The forward AI impact numbers indicate acceleration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives expect stronger effects to take place over the next three years. On average, they expect a 1.4% increase in productivity and a 0.8% rise in output. US executives project a 2.25% productivity gain, while UK firms expect 1.86%. In economies that have struggled with weak productivity growth for over a decade, gains of that magnitude are notable – incremental improvements, compounded across sectors, shift national outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the thorny subject of employment, executives expect a modest 0.7% reduction in headcount across the four countries over the same period. In the UK, around two-thirds of this adjustment is expected to come through slower hiring rather than outright redundancies. That pattern suggests a gradual reallocation of roles rather than abrupt terminations. As with previous waves of automation, aggregate figures do not capture job creation in adjacent roles, and in the case of AI, these might include roles around data governance, model oversight, prompt engineering, and AI-enabled service development, many of which would be new roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interpreting-the-expectation-gap"&gt;Interpreting the expectation gap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also compares executive expectations with those of workers. Researchers fielded parallel questions to US employees through the Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes. Employees expect AI to increase employment at their firms by 0.5% over the next three years, while US executives expect a 1.2% reduction. Employees foresee productivity gains of 0.92%, below the executive forecast of 2.25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This divergence reflects different vantage points. Executives observe cost structures and competitive pressure, while employees experience task-level augmentation and new capabilities. In practice, AI systems are often deployed to assist rather than replace, particularly in knowledge-intensive work. Evidence from controlled trials, including large language model use in customer support and professional services, shows productivity gains concentrated among less experienced staff, with quality improvements appearing alongside better output figures. Where communication and training are clear, adoption tends to proceed with limited resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-ai-impact-data-merits-attention"&gt;Why this AI impact data merits attention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survey design influences inferences from any statistics, and in this particular case, the researchers noted variation between their own figures and those from, for example, a McKinsey survey taken in the same period that put adoption at 88% of organisations (the survey in question here pegs the figure at just 69%). On the other hand, the US Census Business Trends and Outlook Survey, which draws on a broader respondent base, estimated AI use at around 9% in early 2024, rising to 18% by December 2025. This gap reflects differences in sampling, question framing and respondent seniority. Executive surveys tend to capture intent and enterprise-level deployments, while broader business surveys may reflect narrower definitions of AI or earlier stages of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study in question, respondents were phone-verified, unpaid, and predominantly CEOs and CFOs, with over 90% drawn from the UK and Germany. The data was cross-checked against ten years of macro output and employment figures from national statistics agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inflection point executives anticipate may unfold over the next three years as deployments mature and integration improves, in the way that many new technologies have emerged into the workplace until they become everyday tools. The central question is less whether AI will affect productivity and employment, and more how quickly organisations can change the technology’s wider adoption into measurable economic gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s enterprise push: The hidden story behind AI’s sales race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Second, that this will be the very last time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They’re called corpse doves—because the darkest part of their gray plumage surrounds the lighter part, giving the impression that skeleton faces are peeking out from behind trash cans and bushes—and their crime is having the ability to carry diseases that would be compatible with humans. I open my hand, triggering the display from my imprinted handheld, and record an image to verify the elimination. A ding from my palm lets me know I’ve reached my quota for the day and, with that, the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m tempted to give this one a send-off, a real burial with holy words and some flowers, but then I hear a pack of streetrats hooting beside me. My city-issued vest is reflective and nanopainted so it projects a slight glow. I don’t know if it’s to keep us safe like they say, or if it’s just that so many of us are ex-cons working court-ordered labor, and civilians want to be able to keep an eye on us. Either way, everyone treats us like we’re invisible—everyone except children.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I switch the lasernet on the bird from &lt;em&gt;electrocute &lt;/em&gt;to &lt;em&gt;incinerate&lt;/em&gt; and watch as what already looked like a corpse becomes ashes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey, executioner!” says a girl.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Executioner” is not my official title. The branch of city government we work for is called the Department of Mercy, and we’re only ever called technicians. But that doesn’t matter to the child, who can’t be more than eight but has the authority of a judge as she holds up a finger to point me out to her friends.&lt;/p&gt;

Then her eyes darken. “You’re not a cat killer, are you?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No,” I say quickly. “I do horseflies.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know why I lied, but as the suspicion leaves her face and a smile returns, I’m glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You should come down by the docks. We’ve got flies! Make your quota in a day.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The girl tosses her hair, making the tinfoil charms she’s wrapped around her braids tinkle like wind chimes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s my last day. But if I get flies again for next year, I’ll swing by.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another lie, because we both know the city would never send anyone to the docks for flies. Flies are killed because they are a nuisance, which means people only care about clearing them out of suburbs and financial districts. They’d only send a tech down to the docks to kill something that put the city proper at risk through disease, or by using up more resources than they wanted to spare.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LeeLee is expecting me home to sit through the reassignments with her and it’s already late, so I hand out a couple of the combination warming and light sticks I get for winter to the pack of children with nowhere to go. As I walk away, the children are laughing so loud it sounds like screaming. They toss the sticks in the air like signal flares, small bright cries for help that no one will see.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LeeLee’s anxiety takes the form of caretaking, and as soon as I’ve stepped through the door I can smell bread warming and soup on the stove. I take off my muffling boots. Another day, I’d leave them on and sneak up on her just to be irritating, and she’d turn and threaten me with whatever kitchen utensil was at hand. But she’ll be extra nervous today, so I remove the shoes that let me catch nervous birds, and step hard on my way in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems impossible that I can spend a year killing every fragile and defenseless thing I’ve encountered but still take such care with Lee. But I tell myself that the killing isn’t me—it’s just my sentence, and what I do when I have a choice is the only thing that really says anything about me. For the first six months and 400 birds, I believed it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;LeeLee flicks on a smile that lasts a whole three seconds when she sees me, then clouds over again.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Soup’s too thin. There wasn’t enough powder for a real broth.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I like thin soup,” I say.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Not like this. It doesn’t even cover up the taste of the water.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I like the taste of the water,” I say, which breaks her out of her spiraling enough to roll her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I put my hands on her shoulder to stop her fussing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“The soup is going to be fine,” I say. “So will the reassignment.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I’m not much taller than she is, but when we met in juvie she hadn’t hit her last growth spurt yet, so she still tilts her head back to look me in the eyes. “What if it’s not?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It will—”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What if you get whatever assignment Jordan got?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There it is. Because two of us didn’t leave juvie together to start community service—three of us did. But Jordan didn’t last three weeks into his assignment before he turned his implements inward.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I notice she doesn’t say &lt;em&gt;What if  &lt;/em&gt;I &lt;em&gt;get what Jordan got?&lt;/em&gt; Because LeeLee is more afraid of being left alone than of having to kill something innocent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t know what his assignment was,” I say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s true, but we do know it was bad. Two weeks into our first stretch, a drug meant to sterilize the city’s feral cat population accidentally had the opposite effect. Everyone was pulled off their assigned duty for three days to murder litters of new kittens instead. It nearly broke me and Lee, but Jordan seemed almost grateful.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Besides, we don’t know if his assignment had anything to do with … what he did. You’re borrowing trouble. Worry in”—I check my palm—“an hour, when you actually know there’s something to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You’d think it would hover over us too insistently to be ignored, but after we sit down and talk about our day I’m at ease, basking in the warmth of her storytelling and the bread that’s more beige than gray today. When the notification comes in, I am well and truly happy, and I can only hope it isn’t for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We both stiffen when we hear the alert. She looks at me, and I give her a smile and a nod, and then we look down. In the time between hearing the notification and checking it, I imagine all kinds of horrors that could be in my assignment slot. I imagine a picture of kittens, reason enough for the girl I met earlier to condemn me. For a moment, just a flash, I imagine looking down and seeing my own face as my target, or LeeLee’s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But when I finally see the file, the relief that comes over me softens my spine. It’s a plant. Faceless, and bloodless.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I look up, and LeeLee’s eyes are dark as she leans forward, studying my face, looking for whatever crack she failed to see in Jordan. I force myself to smile wide for her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s a plant. I got a plant, Lee.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She reaches forward and squeezes my hands. Hers are shaking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What did you get?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;She waves away my question. “I got rats. I can handle it. I was just worried about you.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I spend the rest of the night unbelievably happy. For the next year, I get to kill a thing that does not scream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You get all that?” the man behind the desk asks, and I nod even though I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’ve traded in my boots and lasernet for a hazmat suit and a handheld mister with two different solutions. The man had been talking to me about how to use the solutions, but I can’t process verbal information very well. The whole reason I was sent to the correctional facility as a teen was that too many teachers mistook my processing delays for behavioral infractions. I’m planning to read the manual on my own time before I start in a few hours, but when I pick up the mister and look down the barrel, the equipment guy freaks out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Did you not hear me? Don’t even look at that thing without your mask on.” He takes a breath, calmer now that I’ve lowered my hands. “Look, the first solution—it’s fine. It’s keyed to the plant itself and just opens its cells up for whatever solution we put on it. You could drink the stuff. But that second? The orange vial? Don’t even put it in the mister without your mask on. It dissipates quickly, so you’re good once you’re done spraying, but not a second before.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He looks around, then leans in. “They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I nod again as I grab the mask I hadn’t noticed before. This time when I thank him, I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It takes me an hour to find the first plant, and when I do&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;it’s beautiful. Lush pink on the inside and dark green on the outside, it looks hearty and primitive. Almost Jurassic. I can see why it’s only in the sewers now: it would be too easy to spot and destroy aboveground in the sea of concrete.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After putting on my mask, I activate the mister and then stand back as it sprays the plant with poison. Nothing happens. I remember the prepping solution and switch the cartridges to coat it in that first. The next time I try the poison, the plant wilts instantly, browning and shrinking like a tire deflating. I was wrong. Plants this size don’t die silently. It makes a wheezing sound, a deep sigh. By the third time I’ve heard it, I swear I can make out the word &lt;em&gt;Please&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="sprout" class="wp-image-1132697" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-531112658.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;HENRY HORENSTEIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I get home, LeeLee’s locked herself in the bathroom, which doesn’t surprise me. I heard that they moved to acid for rats, and the smell of a corpse dissolving is impossible to get used to and even harder to get out of your hair. I eat dinner, read, change for bed, and she’s still in the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The next morning, I have to take a transport to the plant’s habitat on the other end of the city, so I spend the time looking through the file that came with the assignment. Under “Characteristics,” some city government scientist has written, “Large, dark. Resource-intensive. Stubborn.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I stare at the last word. Its own sentence, tacked on like an afterthought. &lt;em&gt;Stubborn.&lt;/em&gt; The same word that was written in my file when I got sent from school to the facility where I met LeeLee and Jordan. Large, dark, stubborn, and condemned. I’ve never been called &lt;em&gt;resource-intensive&lt;/em&gt;. But I have been called a waste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And maybe that’s why I do it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I get to my last plant of the day, I don’t reach for the mister. This one is small, young, the green still neon-bright and the teeth at the edges still soft. I pick it up, careful with its roots, and carry it home. I find a discarded water container along the way and place it inside. When I get home I knock on LeeLee’s door. She doesn’t answer, so I leave the plant on the floor as an offering. They aren’t proper flowers, but they smell nice and earthy. It might keep the residual odor from melted organs, fur, and bones from taking over her room.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Killing things is a dumb job,” says the girl.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After a week of hearing the death cries of its cousins, I was moved to use some of my allowance to buy cheap fertilizer and growth serum for my plant. The girl and her friends, fewer than before, were panhandling at the megastore across the way. She ran over, braids jingling, as soon as she saw me. I thought she’d leave once I gave her more glowsticks for her friends, but she stayed in step and kept following me.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It’s not a dumb job,” I say, even though it is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What’s the point?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I shift my bag to point at the bottom of my vest. Beneath “Mercy Dept.” the department’s slogan is written in cursive: &lt;em&gt;Killing to Save!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“See?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;She sees the text but doesn’t register it, and I have to remind myself that even getting kicked out of school is a privilege. The city had decided to stop wasting educational resources on me. They’d never even tried with her or the other streetrats.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It just means we kill to help.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That doesn’t make sense.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, all I can think about is Jordan. “Maybe they don’t mind.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think of the plants. Maybe they hadn’t been pleading. Maybe they’d been sighing with relief. I think of the birds that eventually stopped running away.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Maybe they’re tired. The city’s right, and their existence isn’t compatible with the world we made. And that’s our fault for being stupid and cruel, but it makes their lives so hard. We’ve made it so they can only live half a life. Maybe the least we can do is finish the job.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a terrible thing to say—even worse to a kid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her eyes go hard. “What are you killing now, executioner?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question surprises me. “Sewer plants. Why?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe you.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d wanted her to leave me alone, but when she runs away I feel suddenly empty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have an issue at work when I can’t find my poison vial.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I tell them it rolled away in the sewer and I couldn’t catch it in time, because I don’t want to tell them I was unobservant enough to let a street kid steal from me. After a stern warning and a mountain of forms, they issue a new vial and don’t add to my service time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_30"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pulling overtime to make up for the day I didn’t have my poison means it’s days before I get to fertilize my houseplant. LeeLee’s door is open, so I bring in the fertilizer and serum. She’s put the plant on her windowsill, but it prefers indirect sunlight, so I move it to the shelf next to her boxes of knickknacks and trinkets. I add the fertilizer to its soil and am about to spray it with the growth serum when I get an idea. I get the mister from my kit and set it up to spray the prepping solution on the little plant to prime it. I open the window and put on my mask, just in case, but I’m sure the man was telling the truth when he called the first liquid harmless. After its cells are open, I spray it with my store-bought growth serum.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m halfway through making dinner when I hear the crash and run into LeeLee’s room.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Shit!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_32"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plant has grown huge, turning adult instantly, and its new weight has taken down LeeLee’s shelf. Dainty keepsake boxes are shattered on our concrete floor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I bend to my knees quickly, so focused on fixing my mistake that I don’t register the oddness of the items I’m picking up—jacks, kids’ toys, a bow—until my fingers touch something small and shimmering. It’s a scrap of silver, still rounded in the shape of the braids it was taken from.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I got rats. I can handle it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d forgotten the city has more than one kind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m waiting up when Lee gets home. I don’t make her tell me. I just grab her kit and rummage through it. Where my kit has a hazmat suit, hers has a stealth mesh to render her invisible. Where I keep my mister, she has a gun loaded with vials too large for rats. I have a mini-vac to suck up excess plant matter to prevent seeds from sprouting. She has zip ties.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the time I’m done, she’s already cracking under the weight of everything she tried to protect me from. Within moments she’s sobbing on the floor. I carry her to her bed and get in beside her. I try not to listen too closely as she recounts every horrible moment, but I’m listening at the end, when she tells me she can’t do it anymore. When she confesses that she’s the one who stole my poison, and has only been waiting to take it because she didn’t have the stomach to do to me what Jordan did to us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_34"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I leave her for just a moment, but by the time I lie back in bed beside her I’ve figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I tell her that she won’t have to take her shift tomorrow. I tell her I’m going to go around the city with my mister and my growth serum. That I’ll move plants from sewers to the yards around City Hall and every public space and the support pylons of important people’s companies, and then spray them so they become huge. The city will freak. I tell her it will be like the kittens, but this time we’ll all be pulled off our assignments to kill plants. And maybe the serum will work too well. Maybe the city was right to fear these plants, and they will grow and grow and eat our concrete while the roots crack our foundations and cut our electricity and everything will crumble. And the people with something to lose might suffer, but the rest of us will just laugh at the perfection of rubble. I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_36"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She asks if I’ll put any at our old detention center.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I tell her, &lt;em&gt;Hundreds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I talk long enough that her eyes close, and loud enough that neither of us can hear the sound of my mister blowing. The man who gave it to me was right. Even without the mask, it doesn’t smell like sulfur. It doesn’t smell like anything.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Micaiah Johnson’s debut novel,&lt;/em&gt; The Space Between Worlds&lt;em&gt;, a &lt;/em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;em&gt; bestseller and &lt;/em&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; Editors’ Choice pick, was named one of the best books of 2020 and one of the best science fiction books of the last decade by NPR.

Second, that this will be the very last time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They’re called corpse doves—because the darkest part of their gray plumage surrounds the lighter part, giving the impression that skeleton faces are peeking out from behind trash cans and bushes—and their crime is having the ability to carry diseases that would be compatible with humans. I open my hand, triggering the display from my imprinted handheld, and record an image to verify the elimination. A ding from my palm lets me know I’ve reached my quota for the day and, with that, the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m tempted to give this one a send-off, a real burial with holy words and some flowers, but then I hear a pack of streetrats hooting beside me. My city-issued vest is reflective and nanopainted so it projects a slight glow. I don’t know if it’s to keep us safe like they say, or if it’s just that so many of us are ex-cons working court-ordered labor, and civilians want to be able to keep an eye on us. Either way, everyone treats us like we’re invisible—everyone except children.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I switch the lasernet on the bird from &lt;em&gt;electrocute &lt;/em&gt;to &lt;em&gt;incinerate&lt;/em&gt; and watch as what already looked like a corpse becomes ashes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey, executioner!” says a girl.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Executioner” is not my official title. The branch of city government we work for is called the Department of Mercy, and we’re only ever called technicians. But that doesn’t matter to the child, who can’t be more than eight but has the authority of a judge as she holds up a finger to point me out to her friends.&lt;/p&gt;

Then her eyes darken. “You’re not a cat killer, are you?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No,” I say quickly. “I do horseflies.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know why I lied, but as the suspicion leaves her face and a smile returns, I’m glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You should come down by the docks. We’ve got flies! Make your quota in a day.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The girl tosses her hair, making the tinfoil charms she’s wrapped around her braids tinkle like wind chimes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s my last day. But if I get flies again for next year, I’ll swing by.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another lie, because we both know the city would never send anyone to the docks for flies. Flies are killed because they are a nuisance, which means people only care about clearing them out of suburbs and financial districts. They’d only send a tech down to the docks to kill something that put the city proper at risk through disease, or by using up more resources than they wanted to spare.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LeeLee is expecting me home to sit through the reassignments with her and it’s already late, so I hand out a couple of the combination warming and light sticks I get for winter to the pack of children with nowhere to go. As I walk away, the children are laughing so loud it sounds like screaming. They toss the sticks in the air like signal flares, small bright cries for help that no one will see.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LeeLee’s anxiety takes the form of caretaking, and as soon as I’ve stepped through the door I can smell bread warming and soup on the stove. I take off my muffling boots. Another day, I’d leave them on and sneak up on her just to be irritating, and she’d turn and threaten me with whatever kitchen utensil was at hand. But she’ll be extra nervous today, so I remove the shoes that let me catch nervous birds, and step hard on my way in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems impossible that I can spend a year killing every fragile and defenseless thing I’ve encountered but still take such care with Lee. But I tell myself that the killing isn’t me—it’s just my sentence, and what I do when I have a choice is the only thing that really says anything about me. For the first six months and 400 birds, I believed it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;LeeLee flicks on a smile that lasts a whole three seconds when she sees me, then clouds over again.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Soup’s too thin. There wasn’t enough powder for a real broth.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I like thin soup,” I say.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Not like this. It doesn’t even cover up the taste of the water.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I like the taste of the water,” I say, which breaks her out of her spiraling enough to roll her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I put my hands on her shoulder to stop her fussing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“The soup is going to be fine,” I say. “So will the reassignment.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I’m not much taller than she is, but when we met in juvie she hadn’t hit her last growth spurt yet, so she still tilts her head back to look me in the eyes. “What if it’s not?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It will—”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What if you get whatever assignment Jordan got?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There it is. Because two of us didn’t leave juvie together to start community service—three of us did. But Jordan didn’t last three weeks into his assignment before he turned his implements inward.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I notice she doesn’t say &lt;em&gt;What if  &lt;/em&gt;I &lt;em&gt;get what Jordan got?&lt;/em&gt; Because LeeLee is more afraid of being left alone than of having to kill something innocent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t know what his assignment was,” I say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s true, but we do know it was bad. Two weeks into our first stretch, a drug meant to sterilize the city’s feral cat population accidentally had the opposite effect. Everyone was pulled off their assigned duty for three days to murder litters of new kittens instead. It nearly broke me and Lee, but Jordan seemed almost grateful.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Besides, we don’t know if his assignment had anything to do with … what he did. You’re borrowing trouble. Worry in”—I check my palm—“an hour, when you actually know there’s something to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You’d think it would hover over us too insistently to be ignored, but after we sit down and talk about our day I’m at ease, basking in the warmth of her storytelling and the bread that’s more beige than gray today. When the notification comes in, I am well and truly happy, and I can only hope it isn’t for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We both stiffen when we hear the alert. She looks at me, and I give her a smile and a nod, and then we look down. In the time between hearing the notification and checking it, I imagine all kinds of horrors that could be in my assignment slot. I imagine a picture of kittens, reason enough for the girl I met earlier to condemn me. For a moment, just a flash, I imagine looking down and seeing my own face as my target, or LeeLee’s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But when I finally see the file, the relief that comes over me softens my spine. It’s a plant. Faceless, and bloodless.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I look up, and LeeLee’s eyes are dark as she leans forward, studying my face, looking for whatever crack she failed to see in Jordan. I force myself to smile wide for her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s a plant. I got a plant, Lee.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She reaches forward and squeezes my hands. Hers are shaking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What did you get?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;She waves away my question. “I got rats. I can handle it. I was just worried about you.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I spend the rest of the night unbelievably happy. For the next year, I get to kill a thing that does not scream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You get all that?” the man behind the desk asks, and I nod even though I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’ve traded in my boots and lasernet for a hazmat suit and a handheld mister with two different solutions. The man had been talking to me about how to use the solutions, but I can’t process verbal information very well. The whole reason I was sent to the correctional facility as a teen was that too many teachers mistook my processing delays for behavioral infractions. I’m planning to read the manual on my own time before I start in a few hours, but when I pick up the mister and look down the barrel, the equipment guy freaks out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Did you not hear me? Don’t even look at that thing without your mask on.” He takes a breath, calmer now that I’ve lowered my hands. “Look, the first solution—it’s fine. It’s keyed to the plant itself and just opens its cells up for whatever solution we put on it. You could drink the stuff. But that second? The orange vial? Don’t even put it in the mister without your mask on. It dissipates quickly, so you’re good once you’re done spraying, but not a second before.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He looks around, then leans in. “They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I nod again as I grab the mask I hadn’t noticed before. This time when I thank him, I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It takes me an hour to find the first plant, and when I do&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;it’s beautiful. Lush pink on the inside and dark green on the outside, it looks hearty and primitive. Almost Jurassic. I can see why it’s only in the sewers now: it would be too easy to spot and destroy aboveground in the sea of concrete.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After putting on my mask, I activate the mister and then stand back as it sprays the plant with poison. Nothing happens. I remember the prepping solution and switch the cartridges to coat it in that first. The next time I try the poison, the plant wilts instantly, browning and shrinking like a tire deflating. I was wrong. Plants this size don’t die silently. It makes a wheezing sound, a deep sigh. By the third time I’ve heard it, I swear I can make out the word &lt;em&gt;Please&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="sprout" class="wp-image-1132697" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-531112658.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;HENRY HORENSTEIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I get home, LeeLee’s locked herself in the bathroom, which doesn’t surprise me. I heard that they moved to acid for rats, and the smell of a corpse dissolving is impossible to get used to and even harder to get out of your hair. I eat dinner, read, change for bed, and she’s still in the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The next morning, I have to take a transport to the plant’s habitat on the other end of the city, so I spend the time looking through the file that came with the assignment. Under “Characteristics,” some city government scientist has written, “Large, dark. Resource-intensive. Stubborn.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I stare at the last word. Its own sentence, tacked on like an afterthought. &lt;em&gt;Stubborn.&lt;/em&gt; The same word that was written in my file when I got sent from school to the facility where I met LeeLee and Jordan. Large, dark, stubborn, and condemned. I’ve never been called &lt;em&gt;resource-intensive&lt;/em&gt;. But I have been called a waste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And maybe that’s why I do it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I get to my last plant of the day, I don’t reach for the mister. This one is small, young, the green still neon-bright and the teeth at the edges still soft. I pick it up, careful with its roots, and carry it home. I find a discarded water container along the way and place it inside. When I get home I knock on LeeLee’s door. She doesn’t answer, so I leave the plant on the floor as an offering. They aren’t proper flowers, but they smell nice and earthy. It might keep the residual odor from melted organs, fur, and bones from taking over her room.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Killing things is a dumb job,” says the girl.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After a week of hearing the death cries of its cousins, I was moved to use some of my allowance to buy cheap fertilizer and growth serum for my plant. The girl and her friends, fewer than before, were panhandling at the megastore across the way. She ran over, braids jingling, as soon as she saw me. I thought she’d leave once I gave her more glowsticks for her friends, but she stayed in step and kept following me.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It’s not a dumb job,” I say, even though it is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What’s the point?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I shift my bag to point at the bottom of my vest. Beneath “Mercy Dept.” the department’s slogan is written in cursive: &lt;em&gt;Killing to Save!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“See?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;She sees the text but doesn’t register it, and I have to remind myself that even getting kicked out of school is a privilege. The city had decided to stop wasting educational resources on me. They’d never even tried with her or the other streetrats.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It just means we kill to help.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That doesn’t make sense.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, all I can think about is Jordan. “Maybe they don’t mind.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think of the plants. Maybe they hadn’t been pleading. Maybe they’d been sighing with relief. I think of the birds that eventually stopped running away.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Maybe they’re tired. The city’s right, and their existence isn’t compatible with the world we made. And that’s our fault for being stupid and cruel, but it makes their lives so hard. We’ve made it so they can only live half a life. Maybe the least we can do is finish the job.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a terrible thing to say—even worse to a kid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her eyes go hard. “What are you killing now, executioner?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question surprises me. “Sewer plants. Why?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe you.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d wanted her to leave me alone, but when she runs away I feel suddenly empty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have an issue at work when I can’t find my poison vial.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I tell them it rolled away in the sewer and I couldn’t catch it in time, because I don’t want to tell them I was unobservant enough to let a street kid steal from me. After a stern warning and a mountain of forms, they issue a new vial and don’t add to my service time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_30"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pulling overtime to make up for the day I didn’t have my poison means it’s days before I get to fertilize my houseplant. LeeLee’s door is open, so I bring in the fertilizer and serum. She’s put the plant on her windowsill, but it prefers indirect sunlight, so I move it to the shelf next to her boxes of knickknacks and trinkets. I add the fertilizer to its soil and am about to spray it with the growth serum when I get an idea. I get the mister from my kit and set it up to spray the prepping solution on the little plant to prime it. I open the window and put on my mask, just in case, but I’m sure the man was telling the truth when he called the first liquid harmless. After its cells are open, I spray it with my store-bought growth serum.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m halfway through making dinner when I hear the crash and run into LeeLee’s room.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Shit!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_32"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plant has grown huge, turning adult instantly, and its new weight has taken down LeeLee’s shelf. Dainty keepsake boxes are shattered on our concrete floor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I bend to my knees quickly, so focused on fixing my mistake that I don’t register the oddness of the items I’m picking up—jacks, kids’ toys, a bow—until my fingers touch something small and shimmering. It’s a scrap of silver, still rounded in the shape of the braids it was taken from.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I got rats. I can handle it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d forgotten the city has more than one kind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m waiting up when Lee gets home. I don’t make her tell me. I just grab her kit and rummage through it. Where my kit has a hazmat suit, hers has a stealth mesh to render her invisible. Where I keep my mister, she has a gun loaded with vials too large for rats. I have a mini-vac to suck up excess plant matter to prevent seeds from sprouting. She has zip ties.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the time I’m done, she’s already cracking under the weight of everything she tried to protect me from. Within moments she’s sobbing on the floor. I carry her to her bed and get in beside her. I try not to listen too closely as she recounts every horrible moment, but I’m listening at the end, when she tells me she can’t do it anymore. When she confesses that she’s the one who stole my poison, and has only been waiting to take it because she didn’t have the stomach to do to me what Jordan did to us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_34"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I leave her for just a moment, but by the time I lie back in bed beside her I’ve figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I tell her that she won’t have to take her shift tomorrow. I tell her I’m going to go around the city with my mister and my growth serum. That I’ll move plants from sewers to the yards around City Hall and every public space and the support pylons of important people’s companies, and then spray them so they become huge. The city will freak. I tell her it will be like the kittens, but this time we’ll all be pulled off our assignments to kill plants. And maybe the serum will work too well. Maybe the city was right to fear these plants, and they will grow and grow and eat our concrete while the roots crack our foundations and cut our electricity and everything will crumble. And the people with something to lose might suffer, but the rest of us will just laugh at the perfection of rubble. I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_36"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She asks if I’ll put any at our old detention center.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I tell her, &lt;em&gt;Hundreds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I talk long enough that her eyes close, and loud enough that neither of us can hear the sound of my mister blowing. The man who gave it to me was right. Even without the mask, it doesn’t smell like sulfur. It doesn’t smell like anything.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Micaiah Johnson’s debut novel,&lt;/em&gt; The Space Between Worlds&lt;em&gt;, a &lt;/em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;em&gt; bestseller and &lt;/em&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; Editors’ Choice pick, was named one of the best books of 2020 and one of the best science fiction books of the last decade by NPR.

Her doctor couldn’t diagnose the cause but said a good, supportive bra could help. A professor of biomechanics, Wakefield-Scurr thought she could do a little research and find a science-backed option. Two decades later, she’s still looking. Wakefield-Scurr now leads an 18-person team at the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Their research shows that the most effective high-impact-sports bras have underwires, padded cups, adjustable underbands and shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye closures. These bras reduce breast movement by up to 74% when compared with wearing no bra. But movement might not be the only metric that matters.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A biological rarity&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Few anatomical structures hang outside of the body unsupported by cartilage, muscle, or bone—meaning there wasn’t much historical research to build on. Wakefield-Scurr’s lab was the first to find that when women run, the motion of the torso causes breasts to move in a three-dimensional pattern—swinging side to side and up and down—as well as moving forward and backward. In an hour of slow jogging, boobs can bounce approximately 10,000 times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A sports necessity&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wearing a bra that’s too tight can limit breathing. Wearing one that’s too loose can create back, shoulder, and neck pain. Pain can also be caused by the lag between torso and breast movement, which causes what is scientifically known as “breast slap.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The lab’s research has also found that the physical discomfort of bad bras, combined with the embarrassment of flopping around, is the one of the biggest barriers to exercise for women and that if women have a good sports bra, they’re more willing to go for a run.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An open question&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some bras function by deliberately compressing breasts. Others encapsulate and support each individual breast. But scientists still don’t know whether it’s more biomechanically important to reduce the breasts’ motion entirely, to reduce the speed at which they move, or to reduce breast slap. Will women constantly be forced to choose between the comfort of a stretchier bra and the support of a more restrictive one?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wakefield-Scurr is excited about new materials she’s tested that tighten or stretch depending on how you move.

Her doctor couldn’t diagnose the cause but said a good, supportive bra could help. A professor of biomechanics, Wakefield-Scurr thought she could do a little research and find a science-backed option. Two decades later, she’s still looking. Wakefield-Scurr now leads an 18-person team at the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Their research shows that the most effective high-impact-sports bras have underwires, padded cups, adjustable underbands and shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye closures. These bras reduce breast movement by up to 74% when compared with wearing no bra. But movement might not be the only metric that matters.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A biological rarity&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Few anatomical structures hang outside of the body unsupported by cartilage, muscle, or bone—meaning there wasn’t much historical research to build on. Wakefield-Scurr’s lab was the first to find that when women run, the motion of the torso causes breasts to move in a three-dimensional pattern—swinging side to side and up and down—as well as moving forward and backward. In an hour of slow jogging, boobs can bounce approximately 10,000 times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A sports necessity&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wearing a bra that’s too tight can limit breathing. Wearing one that’s too loose can create back, shoulder, and neck pain. Pain can also be caused by the lag between torso and breast movement, which causes what is scientifically known as “breast slap.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The lab’s research has also found that the physical discomfort of bad bras, combined with the embarrassment of flopping around, is the one of the biggest barriers to exercise for women and that if women have a good sports bra, they’re more willing to go for a run.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An open question&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some bras function by deliberately compressing breasts. Others encapsulate and support each individual breast. But scientists still don’t know whether it’s more biomechanically important to reduce the breasts’ motion entirely, to reduce the speed at which they move, or to reduce breast slap. Will women constantly be forced to choose between the comfort of a stretchier bra and the support of a more restrictive one?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wakefield-Scurr is excited about new materials she’s tested that tighten or stretch depending on how you move. She’s working with fabric manufacturers and clothing companies to try out their wares. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As more women take up high-impact sports, the need to understand what makes a good bra grows. Wakefield-Scurr says her lab can’t keep up with demand.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The system will be hosted in India and follow local data residency, security, and compliance rules. The project aims to provide computing resources for AI applications to educational institutions, government entities, and small and medium enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Sovereign AI infrastructure is becoming essential for national competitiveness. This project brings that capability to India at a national scale, enabling local researchers, innovators, and enterprises to become AI-native while maintaining full data sovereignty and security,” Manu Jain, CEO of G42 India, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Abu Dhabi’s&amp;nbsp;Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and India’s Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) are also part of the project.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Deploying this system in India marks a significant step forward in the country’s computational capacity and sovereign AI initiatives. It will accelerate training and inference for large-scale models, enabling researchers and developers to build AI tailored to India’s needs,” said Andy Hock, chief strategy officer at Cerebras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The India AI Impact Summit this week saw several AI infrastructure initiatives being launched by both Indian giants and international firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indian conglomerate Adani pledged $100 billion to build up to 5 gigawatts of data-center capacity in the country by 2035. Reliance also said it would invest $110 billion over the next seven years for gigawatt-scale data centers. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following backlash in a Hacker News thread, Microsoft deleted a blog post that critics said encouraged developers to pirate Harry Potter books to train AI models that could then be used to create AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog, which is archived here, was written in November 2024 by a senior product manager, Pooja Kamath. According to her LinkedIn, Kamath has been at Microsoft for more than a decade and remains with the company. In 2024, Microsoft tapped her to promote a new feature that the blog said made it easier to “add generative AI features to your own applications with just a few lines of code using Azure SQL DB, LangChain, and LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What better way to show “engaging and relatable examples” of Microsoft’s new feature that would “resonate with a wide audience” than to “use a well-known dataset” like Harry Potter books, the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books are “one of the most famous and cherished series in literary history,” the blog noted, and fans could use the LLMs they trained in two fun ways: building Q&amp;amp;A systems providing “context-rich answers” and generating “new AI-driven Harry Potter fan fiction” that’s “sure to delight Potterheads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help Microsoft customers achieve this vision, the blog linked to a Kaggle dataset that included all seven Harry Potter books, which, Ars verified, has been available online for years and incorrectly marked as “public domain.” Kaggle’s terms say that rights holders can send notices of infringing content and repeated offenders risk suspensions, but Hacker News commenters speculated that the Harry Potter dataset flew under the radar, with only 10,000 downloads over time not catching the attention of J.K. Rowling, who famously keeps a strong grip on the Harry Potter copyrights. The dataset was promptly deleted on Thursday after Ars reached out to the uploader, Shubham Maindola, a data scientist in India with no apparent links to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
            
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Maindola told Ars that “the dataset was marked as Public Domain by mistake. There was no intention to misrepresent the licensing status of the works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether Kamath was directed to link to the Harry Potter books dataset in the blog, or it was an individual choice. Cathay Y. N. Smith, a law professor and co-director of Chicago-Kent College of Law’s Program in Intellectual Property Law, told Ars that Kamath may not have realized the books were too recent to be in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone might be really knowledgeable about books and technology, but not necessarily about copyright terms and how long they last,” Smith said. “Especially if she saw that something was marked by another reputable company as being public domain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined Ars’ request to comment. Kaggle did not respond to Ars’ request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft pulling blog was “probably smart”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Hacker News, commenters suggested that it’s unlikely anyone familiar with the popular franchise would believe the Harry Potter books were in the public domain. They debated whether Microsoft’s blog was “problematic copyright-wise,” since Microsoft not only encouraged customers to download the infringing materials but also used the books themselves to create Harry Potter AI models that relied on beloved characters to hype Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s blog was posted more than a year ago, at a time when AI firms began facing lawsuits over AI models accused of infringing copyrights by allegedly training on pirated materials and regurgitating works verbatim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog recommended that users learn to train their own AI models by downloading the Harry Potter dataset and then uploading text files to Azure Blob Storage. It included example models based on a dataset that Microsoft seemingly uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, which only included the first book, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s&amp;nbsp;Stone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training large language models (LLMs) on text files, Harry Potter fans could create Q&amp;amp;A systems capable of pulling up relevant excerpts of books. An example query offered was “Wizarding World snacks,” which retrieved an excerpt from &lt;em&gt;The Sorcerer’s&amp;nbsp;Stone&lt;/em&gt; where Harry marvels at strange treats like Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans and chocolate frogs. Another prompt asking “How did Harry feel when he first learnt that he was a Wizard?” generated an output pointing to various early excerpts in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps an even more exciting use case, Kamath suggested, was generating fan fiction to “explore new adventures” and “even create alternate endings.” That model could quickly comb the dataset for “contextually similar” excerpts that could be used to output fresh stories that fit with existing narratives and incorporate “elements from the retrieved passages,” the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, Kamath trained a model to write a Harry Potter story she could use to market the feature she was blogging about. She asked the model to write a story in which Harry meets a new friend on the Hogwarts Express train who tells him all about Microsoft’s Native Vector Support in SQL “in the Muggle world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on parts of &lt;em&gt;The Sorcerer’s Stone&lt;/em&gt; where Harry learns about Quidditch and gets to know Hermione Granger, the fan fiction showed a boy selling Harry on Microsoft’s “amazing” new feature. To do this, he likened it to having a spell that helps you find exactly what you need among thousands of options, instantly, while declaring it was perfect for machine learning, AI, and recommendation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further blurring the lines between Microsoft and Harry Potter brands, Kamath also generated an image showing Harry with his new friend, stamped with a Microsoft logo.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith told Ars that both use cases could frustrate rights holders, depending on the content in the model outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that the regurgitation and the creation of fan fiction, they both could flag copyright issues in that fan fiction often has to take from the expressive elements, a copyrighted character, a character that’s famous enough to be protected by a copyright law or plot stories or sequences,” Smith said. “If these things are copied and reproduced, then that output could be potentially infringing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also still a gray area. Looking at the blog, Smith said, “I would be concerned,” but “I wouldn’t say it’s automatically infringement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith told Ars that Microsoft pulling the blog “was probably smart” since courts have only generally said that AI training on copyrighted books is fair use. But courts continue to probe questions about pirated AI training materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the deleted Kaggle dataset page, Maindola previously explained that to source the data, he “downloaded the ebooks and then converted them to txt files.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft may have infringed copyrights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft ever faced questions over whether the company knowingly used pirated books to train the example models, fair use “could be a difficult argument,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker News commenters suggested the blog could be considered fair use, since the training guide was for “educational purposes,” and Smith said that Microsoft could raise some “good arguments” in its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, she also suggested that Microsoft could be deemed liable in some ways for contributing to infringement on some level after leaving the blog up for a year. Before it was removed, the Kaggle dataset was downloaded more than 10,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ultimate result is to create something infringing by saying, ‘Hey, here you go, go grab that infringing stuff and use that in our system,’” Smith said. “They could potentially have some sort of secondary contributory liability for copyright infringement, downloading it, as well as then using it to encourage others to use it for training purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Hacker News, commenters slammed the blog, including a self-described former Microsoft employee who claimed that Microsoft lets employees “blog without having to go through some approval or editing process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks like somebody made a bad judgment call on what to put in a company blog post (and maybe what constitutes ethical activity) and that it was taken down as soon as someone noticed,” the former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others suggested the blame was solely with the Kaggle uploader, Maindola, who told Ars that the dataset should never have been marked “public domain.” But Microsoft critics pushed back, noting that the Kaggle page made it clear that no special permission was granted and Microsoft’s employee should have known better. “They don’t need to know any details to know that these properties belong to massive companies and aren’t free for the taking,” one commenter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harry Potter books weren’t the only books targeted, the thread noted, linking to a separate Azure sample containing Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, which is also not in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft could have used any dataset for their blog, they could have even chosen to use actual public domain novels,” another Hacker News commenter wrote. “Instead, they opted to use copywritten works that J.K. hasn’t released into the public domain (unless user ‘Shubham Maindola’ is J.K.’s alter ego).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith suggested Microsoft could have avoided this week’s backlash by more carefully reviewing blogs, noting that “if a company is risk averse, this would probably be flagged.” But she also understood Kamath’s preference for Harry Potter over the many long-forgotten characters that exist in the public domain. On Hacker News, some commenters defended Kamath’s blog, urging that it should be considered fair use since nonprofits and educational institutions could do the same thing in a teaching context without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would have been concerned if I were the one clearing this for Microsoft, but at the same time, I completely understand what this employee was doing,” Smith said. “No one wants to write fan fiction about books that are in the public domain.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following backlash in a Hacker News thread, Microsoft deleted a blog post that critics said encouraged developers to pirate Harry Potter books to train AI models that could then be used to create AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog, which is archived here, was written in November 2024 by a senior product manager, Pooja Kamath. According to her LinkedIn, Kamath has been at Microsoft for more than a decade and remains with the company. In 2024, Microsoft tapped her to promote a new feature that the blog said made it easier to “add generative AI features to your own applications with just a few lines of code using Azure SQL DB, LangChain, and LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What better way to show “engaging and relatable examples” of Microsoft’s new feature that would “resonate with a wide audience” than to “use a well-known dataset” like Harry Potter books, the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books are “one of the most famous and cherished series in literary history,” the blog noted, and fans could use the LLMs they trained in two fun ways: building Q&amp;amp;A systems providing “context-rich answers” and generating “new AI-driven Harry Potter fan fiction” that’s “sure to delight Potterheads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help Microsoft customers achieve this vision, the blog linked to a Kaggle dataset that included all seven Harry Potter books, which, Ars verified, has been available online for years and incorrectly marked as “public domain.” Kaggle’s terms say that rights holders can send notices of infringing content and repeated offenders risk suspensions, but Hacker News commenters speculated that the Harry Potter dataset flew under the radar, with only 10,000 downloads over time not catching the attention of J.K. Rowling, who famously keeps a strong grip on the Harry Potter copyrights. The dataset was promptly deleted on Thursday after Ars reached out to the uploader, Shubham Maindola, a data scientist in India with no apparent links to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
            
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Maindola told Ars that “the dataset was marked as Public Domain by mistake. There was no intention to misrepresent the licensing status of the works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether Kamath was directed to link to the Harry Potter books dataset in the blog, or it was an individual choice. Cathay Y. N. Smith, a law professor and co-director of Chicago-Kent College of Law’s Program in Intellectual Property Law, told Ars that Kamath may not have realized the books were too recent to be in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone might be really knowledgeable about books and technology, but not necessarily about copyright terms and how long they last,” Smith said. “Especially if she saw that something was marked by another reputable company as being public domain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined Ars’ request to comment. Kaggle did not respond to Ars’ request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft pulling blog was “probably smart”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Hacker News, commenters suggested that it’s unlikely anyone familiar with the popular franchise would believe the Harry Potter books were in the public domain. They debated whether Microsoft’s blog was “problematic copyright-wise,” since Microsoft not only encouraged customers to download the infringing materials but also used the books themselves to create Harry Potter AI models that relied on beloved characters to hype Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s blog was posted more than a year ago, at a time when AI firms began facing lawsuits over AI models accused of infringing copyrights by allegedly training on pirated materials and regurgitating works verbatim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog recommended that users learn to train their own AI models by downloading the Harry Potter dataset and then uploading text files to Azure Blob Storage. It included example models based on a dataset that Microsoft seemingly uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, which only included the first book, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s&amp;nbsp;Stone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training large language models (LLMs) on text files, Harry Potter fans could create Q&amp;amp;A systems capable of pulling up relevant excerpts of books. An example query offered was “Wizarding World snacks,” which retrieved an excerpt from &lt;em&gt;The Sorcerer’s&amp;nbsp;Stone&lt;/em&gt; where Harry marvels at strange treats like Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans and chocolate frogs. Another prompt asking “How did Harry feel when he first learnt that he was a Wizard?” generated an output pointing to various early excerpts in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-content "&gt;
              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Example from Microsoft’s blog of a Q&amp;amp;A system output.&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="hidden md:block"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-content left"&gt;
              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Example from Microsoft’s blog of a Q&amp;amp;A system output.&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-content right"&gt;
              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Example from Microsoft’s blog of a Q&amp;amp;A system output.&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps an even more exciting use case, Kamath suggested, was generating fan fiction to “explore new adventures” and “even create alternate endings.” That model could quickly comb the dataset for “contextually similar” excerpts that could be used to output fresh stories that fit with existing narratives and incorporate “elements from the retrieved passages,” the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, Kamath trained a model to write a Harry Potter story she could use to market the feature she was blogging about. She asked the model to write a story in which Harry meets a new friend on the Hogwarts Express train who tells him all about Microsoft’s Native Vector Support in SQL “in the Muggle world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on parts of &lt;em&gt;The Sorcerer’s Stone&lt;/em&gt; where Harry learns about Quidditch and gets to know Hermione Granger, the fan fiction showed a boy selling Harry on Microsoft’s “amazing” new feature. To do this, he likened it to having a spell that helps you find exactly what you need among thousands of options, instantly, while declaring it was perfect for machine learning, AI, and recommendation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further blurring the lines between Microsoft and Harry Potter brands, Kamath also generated an image showing Harry with his new friend, stamped with a Microsoft logo.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
            
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith told Ars that both use cases could frustrate rights holders, depending on the content in the model outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that the regurgitation and the creation of fan fiction, they both could flag copyright issues in that fan fiction often has to take from the expressive elements, a copyrighted character, a character that’s famous enough to be protected by a copyright law or plot stories or sequences,” Smith said. “If these things are copied and reproduced, then that output could be potentially infringing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also still a gray area. Looking at the blog, Smith said, “I would be concerned,” but “I wouldn’t say it’s automatically infringement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith told Ars that Microsoft pulling the blog “was probably smart” since courts have only generally said that AI training on copyrighted books is fair use. But courts continue to probe questions about pirated AI training materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the deleted Kaggle dataset page, Maindola previously explained that to source the data, he “downloaded the ebooks and then converted them to txt files.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft may have infringed copyrights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft ever faced questions over whether the company knowingly used pirated books to train the example models, fair use “could be a difficult argument,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker News commenters suggested the blog could be considered fair use, since the training guide was for “educational purposes,” and Smith said that Microsoft could raise some “good arguments” in its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, she also suggested that Microsoft could be deemed liable in some ways for contributing to infringement on some level after leaving the blog up for a year. Before it was removed, the Kaggle dataset was downloaded more than 10,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ultimate result is to create something infringing by saying, ‘Hey, here you go, go grab that infringing stuff and use that in our system,’” Smith said. “They could potentially have some sort of secondary contributory liability for copyright infringement, downloading it, as well as then using it to encourage others to use it for training purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Hacker News, commenters slammed the blog, including a self-described former Microsoft employee who claimed that Microsoft lets employees “blog without having to go through some approval or editing process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks like somebody made a bad judgment call on what to put in a company blog post (and maybe what constitutes ethical activity) and that it was taken down as soon as someone noticed,” the former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others suggested the blame was solely with the Kaggle uploader, Maindola, who told Ars that the dataset should never have been marked “public domain.” But Microsoft critics pushed back, noting that the Kaggle page made it clear that no special permission was granted and Microsoft’s employee should have known better. “They don’t need to know any details to know that these properties belong to massive companies and aren’t free for the taking,” one commenter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harry Potter books weren’t the only books targeted, the thread noted, linking to a separate Azure sample containing Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, which is also not in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft could have used any dataset for their blog, they could have even chosen to use actual public domain novels,” another Hacker News commenter wrote. “Instead, they opted to use copywritten works that J.K. hasn’t released into the public domain (unless user ‘Shubham Maindola’ is J.K.’s alter ego).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith suggested Microsoft could have avoided this week’s backlash by more carefully reviewing blogs, noting that “if a company is risk averse, this would probably be flagged.” But she also understood Kamath’s preference for Harry Potter over the many long-forgotten characters that exist in the public domain. On Hacker News, some commenters defended Kamath’s blog, urging that it should be considered fair use since nonprofits and educational institutions could do the same thing in a teaching context without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would have been concerned if I were the one clearing this for Microsoft, but at the same time, I completely understand what this employee was doing,” Smith said. “No one wants to write fan fiction about books that are in the public domain.”&lt;/p&gt;
