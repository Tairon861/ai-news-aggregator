At the time, to get around a national block on ChatGPT, students had to buy a mirror-site version from a secondhand marketplace. Its use was common, but it was at best tolerated and more often frowned upon. Now, her professors no longer warn students against using AI. Instead, they’re encouraged to use it—as long as they follow best practices.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She is far from alone. Just like those in the West, Chinese universities are going through a quiet revolution. According to a recent survey by the Mycos Institute, a Chinese higher-education research group, the use of generative AI on campus has become nearly universal. The same survey reports that just 1% of university faculty and students in China reported never using AI tools in their studies or work. Nearly 60% said they used them frequently—either multiple times a day or several times a week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there’s a crucial difference. While many educators in the West see AI as a threat they have to manage, more Chinese classrooms are treating it as a skill to be mastered. In fact, as the Chinese-developed model DeepSeek gains in popularity globally, people increasingly see it as a source of national pride. The&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;conversation in Chinese universities has gradually shifted from worrying about the implications for academic integrity to encouraging literacy, productivity, and staying ahead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The cultural divide is even more apparent in public sentiment. A report on global AI attitudes from Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) found that China leads the world in enthusiasm. About 80% of Chinese respondents said they were “excited” about new AI services—compared with just 35% in the US and 38% in the UK.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“This attitude isn’t surprising,” says Fang Kecheng, a professor in communications at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “There’s a long tradition in China of believing in technology as a driver of national progress, tracing back to the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping was already saying that science and technology are primary productive forces.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From taboo to toolkit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Liu Bingyu, one of He’s professors at the China University of Political Science and Law, says AI can act as “instructor, brainstorm partner, secretary, and devil’s advocate.” She added a full session on AI guidelines to her lecture series this year, after the university encouraged “responsible and confident” use of AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Liu recommends that students use generative AI to write literature reviews, draft abstracts, generate charts, and organize thoughts. She’s created slides that lay out detailed examples of good and bad prompts, along with one core principle: AI can’t replace human judgment. “Only high-quality input and smart prompting can lead to good results,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The ability to interact with machines is one of the most important skills in today’s world,” Liu told her class. “And instead of having students do it privately, we should talk about it out in the open.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This reflects a growing trend across the country. &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; reviewed the AI strategies of 46 top Chinese universities and found that almost all of them have added interdisciplinary AI general‑education classes, AI related degree programs and AI literacy modules in the past year. Tsinghua, for example, is establishing a new undergraduate general education college to train students in AI plus another traditional discipline, like biology, healthcare, science, or humanities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Major institutions like Remin, Nanjing, and Fudan Universities have rolled out general-access AI courses and degree programs that are open to all students, not reserved for computer science majors like the traditional machine-learning classes. At Zhejiang University, an introductory AI class will become mandatory for undergraduates starting in 2024.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lin Shangxin, principal of Renmin University of China recently told local media that AI was an “unprecedented opportunity” for humanities and social sciences. “Intead of a challenge, I believe AI would empower humanities studies,” Lin said told &lt;em&gt;The Paper&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The collective action echoes a central government push. In April 2025, the Ministry of Education released new national guidelines calling for sweeping “AI+ education” reforms, aimed at cultivating critical thinking, digital fluency, and real‐world skills at all education levels. Earlier this year, the Beijing municipal government mandated AI education across all schools in the city—from universities to K–12.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fang believes that more formal AI literacy education will help bridge an emerging divide between students. “There’s a big gap in digital literacy,” he says. “Some students are fluent in AI tools. Others are lost.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the AI university&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the absence of Western tools like ChatGPT and Claude, many Chinese universities have begun deploying local versions of DeepSeek on campus servers to support students. Many top universities have deployed their own locally hosted versions of Deepseek. These campus-specific AI systems–often referred to as the “full-blood version” of Deepseek—offer longer context windows, unlimited dialogue rounds and broader functionality than public-facing free versions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This mirrors a broader trend in the West, where companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are rolling out campus-wide education tiers—OpenAI recently offered free ChatGPT Plus to all U.S. and Canadian college students, while Anthropic launched Claude for Education with partners like Northeastern and LSE. But in China, the initiative is typically university-led rather than driven by the companies themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The goal, according to Zhejiang University, is to offer students full access to AI tools so they can stay up to date with the fast-changing technology. Students can use their ID to access the models for free.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yanyan Li and Meifang Zhuo, two researchers at Warwick University who have studied students’ use of AI at universities in the UK, believe that AI literacy education has become crucial to students’ success.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With their colleague Gunisha Aggarwal, they conducted focus groups including college students from different backgrounds and levels to find out how AI is used in academic studies. They found that students’ knowledge of how to use AI comes mainly from personal exploration. “While most students understand that AI output is not always trustworthy, we observed a lot of anxiety on how to use it right,” says Li.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal shouldn’t be preventing students from using AI but guiding them to harness it for effective learning and higher-order thinking,” says Zhuo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That lesson has come slowly. A student at Central China Normal University in Wuhan told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that just a year ago, most of his classmates paid for mirror websites of ChatGPT, using VPNs or semi-legal online marketplaces to access Western models. “Now, everyone just uses DeepSeek and Doubao,” he said. “It’s cheaper, it works in Chinese, and no one’s worried about getting flagged anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, even with increased institutional support, many students feel anxious about whether they’re using AI correctly—or ethically. The use of AI detection tools has created an informal gray economy, where students pay hundreds of yuan to freelancers promising to “AI-detection-proof” their writing, according to a &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; report. Three students told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that this environment has created confusion, stress, and increased anxiety. Across the board, they said they appreciate it when their professor offers clear policies and practical advice, not just warnings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He, the law student in Beijing, recently joined a career development group to learn more AI skills to prepare for the job market. To many like her, understanding how to use AI better is not just a studying hack but a necessary skill in China’s fragile job market. Eighty percent of job openings available to fresh graduates listed AI-related skills as a plus in 2025, according to a report by the Chinese media outlet YiCai. In a slowed-down economy and a competitive job market, many students see AI as a lifeline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“We need to rethink what is considered ‘original work’ in the age of AI” says Zhuo, “and universities are a crucial site of that conversation”.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/students-ai.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just two years ago, Lorraine He, now a 24-year-old law student,&amp;nbsp; was told to avoid using AI for her assignments.

But when it deployed it in the real world, it still couldn’t remove biases. So why did Amsterdam fail?

At the time, to get around a national block on ChatGPT, students had to buy a mirror-site version from a secondhand marketplace. Its use was common, but it was at best tolerated and more often frowned upon. Now, professors no longer warn students against using AI. Instead, they’re encouraged to use it—as long as they follow best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like those in the West, Chinese universities are going through a quiet revolution. The use of generative AI on campus has become nearly universal. However, there’s a crucial difference. While many educators in the West see AI as a threat they have to manage, more Chinese classrooms are treating it as a skill to be mastered.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Caiwei Chen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The round included participation from existing investors Decibel, Sunflower Capital, and Kaya, along with notable angels including Scott Johnston, former CEO of Docker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E2B’s technology addresses a critical infrastructure gap as companies increasingly deploy AI agents — autonomous software programs that can execute complex, multi-step tasks including code generation, data analysis, and web browsing. Unlike traditional cloud computing designed for human users, E2B provides secure, isolated computing environments where AI agents can safely run potentially dangerous code without compromising enterprise systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Enterprises have enormous expectations for AI agents. However, we’re asking them to scale and perform on legacy infrastructure that wasn’t designed for autonomous agents,” said Vasek Mlejnsky, co-founder and CEO of E2B, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “E2B solves this by equipping AI agents with safe, scalable, high-performance cloud infrastructure designed specifically for production-scale agent deployments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding reflects explosive revenue growth, with E2B adding “seven figures” in new business just in the past month, according to Mlejnsky. The company has processed hundreds of millions of sandbox sessions since October, demonstrating the scale at which enterprises are deploying AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E2B’s customer roster reads like a who’s who of AI innovation: search engine Perplexity uses E2B to power advanced data analysis features for Pro users, implementing the capability in just one week. AI chip company Groq relies on E2B for secure code execution in its Compound AI systems. Workflow automation platform Lindy integrated E2B to enable custom Python and JavaScript execution within user workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The startup’s technology has also become critical infrastructure for AI research. Hugging Face, the leading AI model repository, uses E2B to safely execute code during reinforcement learning experiments for replicating advanced models like DeepSeek-R1. Meanwhile, UC Berkeley’s LMArena platform has launched over 230,000 E2B sandboxes to evaluate large language models’ web development capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-firecracker-microvms-solve-the-dangerous-code-problem-plaguing-ai-development"&gt;Firecracker microVMs solve the dangerous code problem plaguing AI development&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E2B’s core innovation lies in its use of Firecracker microVMs — lightweight virtual machines originally developed by Amazon Web Services — to create completely isolated environments for AI-generated code execution. This addresses a fundamental security challenge: AI agents often need to run untrusted code that could potentially damage systems or access sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When talking to customers and special enterprises, their biggest decision is almost always build versus buy,” Mlejnsky explained in an interview. “With the build versus buy solution, it all really comes down to whether you want to spend next six to 12 months building this hiring five to 10 person infrastructure team that will cost you at least half a million dollars…or you can use our plug and play solution.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform supports multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, and C++, and can spin up new computing environments in approximately 150 milliseconds — fast enough to maintain the real-time responsiveness users expect from AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprise customers particularly value E2B’s open-source approach and deployment flexibility. Companies can self-host the entire platform for free or deploy it within their own virtual private clouds (VPCs) to maintain data sovereignty — a critical requirement for Fortune 100 firms handling sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-perfect-timing-as-microsoft-layoffs-signal-shift-toward-ai-worker-replacement"&gt;Perfect timing as Microsoft layoffs signal shift toward AI worker replacement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The funding comes at a pivotal moment for AI agent technology. Recent advances in large language models have made AI agents increasingly capable of handling complex, real-world tasks. Microsoft recently laid off thousands of employees while expecting AI agents to perform previously human-only work, Mlejnsky pointed out in our interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, infrastructure limitations have constrained AI agent adoption. Industry data suggests fewer than 30% of AI agents successfully make it to production deployment, often due to security, scalability, and reliability challenges that E2B’s platform aims to solve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re building the next cloud,” Mlejnsky said, outlining the company’s ambitious vision. “The current world runs on Cloud 2.0, which was made for humans. We’re building the open-source cloud for AI agents where they can be autonomous and run securely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The market opportunity appears substantial. Code generation assistants already produce at least 25% of the world’s software code, while JPMorgan Chase saved 360,000 hours annually through document processing agents. Enterprise leaders expect to automate 15% to 50% of manual tasks using AI agents, creating massive demand for supporting infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-open-source-strategy-creates-defensive-moat-against-tech-giants-like-amazon-and-google"&gt;Open-source strategy creates defensive moat against tech giants like Amazon and Google&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E2B faces potential competition from cloud giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, which could theoretically replicate similar functionality. However, the company has built competitive advantages through its open-source approach and focus on AI-specific use cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t really care” about the underlying virtualization technology, Mlejnsky explained, noting that E2B focuses on creating an open standard for how AI agents interact with computing resources. “We are even like actually partnering with a lot of these cloud providers too, because a lot of enterprise customers actually want to deploy E2B inside their AWS account.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s open-source sandbox protocol has become a de facto standard, with hundreds of millions of compute instances demonstrating its real-world effectiveness. This network effect makes it difficult for competitors to displace E2B once enterprises have standardized on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alternative solutions like Docker containers, while technically possible, lack the security isolation and performance characteristics required for production AI agent deployments. Building similar capabilities in-house typically requires 5-10 infrastructure engineers and at least $500,000 in annual costs, according to Mlejnsky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-features-like-24-hour-sessions-and-20-000-concurrent-sandboxes-drive-fortune-100-adoption"&gt;Enterprise features like 24-hour sessions and 20,000 concurrent sandboxes drive Fortune 100 adoption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E2B’s enterprise success stems from features specifically designed for large-scale AI deployments. The platform can scale from 100 concurrent sandboxes on the free tier to 20,000 concurrent environments for enterprise customers, with each sandbox capable of running for up to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advanced enterprise features include comprehensive logging and monitoring, network security controls, and secrets management — capabilities essential for Fortune 100 compliance requirements. The platform integrates with existing enterprise infrastructure while providing the granular controls security teams demand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have very strong inbound,” Mlejnsky noted, describing the sales process. “Once we tackle the 87% we will come back for those 13%.” Customer objections typically focus on security and privacy controls rather than fundamental technology concerns, indicating broad market acceptance of the core value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-insight-partners-21m-bet-validates-ai-infrastructure-as-next-major-software-category"&gt;Insight Partners’ $21M bet validates AI infrastructure as next major software category&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insight Partners‘ investment reflects growing investor confidence in AI infrastructure companies. The global software investor, which manages over $90 billion in regulatory assets, has invested in more than 800 companies worldwide and seen 55 portfolio companies achieve initial public offerings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insight Partners is excited to back E2B’s visionary team as they pioneer essential infrastructure for AI agents,” said Praveen Akkiraju, Managing Director at Insight Partners. “Such rapid growth and enterprise adoption can be difficult to achieve, and we believe that E2B’s open-source sandbox standard will become a cornerstone of secure and scalable AI adoption across the Fortune 100 and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investment will fund expansion of E2B’s engineering and go-to-market teams in San Francisco, development of additional platform features, and support for the growing customer base. The company plans to strengthen its open-source sandbox protocol as a universal standard while developing enterprise-grade modules like secrets vault and monitoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-infrastructure-play-that-could-define-enterprise-ai-s-next-chapter"&gt;The infrastructure play that could define enterprise AI’s next chapter&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E2B’s trajectory reveals a fundamental shift in how enterprises approach AI deployment. While much attention has focused on large language models and AI applications, the company’s rapid adoption among Fortune 100 firms demonstrates that specialized infrastructure has become the critical bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The startup’s success also highlights a broader trend: as AI agents transition from experimental tools to mission-critical systems, the underlying infrastructure requirements more closely resemble those of traditional enterprise software than consumer AI applications. Security, compliance, and scalability — not just model performance — now determine which AI initiatives succeed at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprise technology leaders, E2B’s emergence as essential infrastructure suggests that AI transformation strategies must account for more than just model selection and application development. The companies that successfully scale AI agents will be those that invest early in the specialized infrastructure layer that makes autonomous AI operation possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an era where AI agents are poised to handle an ever-growing share of knowledge work, the platforms that keep those agents running safely may prove more valuable than the agents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

The round included participation from existing investors Decibel, Sunflower Capital, and Kaya, along with notable angels including Scott Johnston, former CEO of Docker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E2B’s technology addresses a critical infrastructure gap as companies increasingly deploy AI agents — autonomous software programs that can execute complex, multi-step tasks including code generation, data analysis, and web browsing. Unlike traditional cloud computing designed for human users, E2B provides secure, isolated computing environments where AI agents can safely run potentially dangerous code without compromising enterprise systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Enterprises have enormous expectations for AI agents. However, we’re asking them to scale and perform on legacy infrastructure that wasn’t designed for autonomous agents,” said Vasek Mlejnsky, co-founder and CEO of E2B, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “E2B solves this by equipping AI agents with safe, scalable, high-performance cloud infrastructure designed specifically for production-scale agent deployments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-seven-figure-monthly-revenue-spike-shows-enterprises-betting-big-on-ai-automation"&gt;Seven-figure monthly revenue spike shows enterprises betting big on AI automation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The funding reflects explosive revenue growth, with E2B adding “seven figures” in new business just in the past month, according to Mlejnsky. The company has processed hundreds of millions of sandbox sessions since October, demonstrating the scale at which enterprises are deploying AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E2B’s customer roster reads like a who’s who of AI innovation: search engine Perplexity uses E2B to power advanced data analysis features for Pro users, implementing the capability in just one week. AI chip company Groq relies on E2B for secure code execution in its Compound AI systems. Workflow automation platform Lindy integrated E2B to enable custom Python and JavaScript execution within user workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The startup’s technology has also become critical infrastructure for AI research. Hugging Face, the leading AI model repository, uses E2B to safely execute code during reinforcement learning experiments for replicating advanced models like DeepSeek-R1. Meanwhile, UC Berkeley’s LMArena platform has launched over 230,000 E2B sandboxes to evaluate large language models’ web development capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-firecracker-microvms-solve-the-dangerous-code-problem-plaguing-ai-development"&gt;Firecracker microVMs solve the dangerous code problem plaguing AI development&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E2B’s core innovation lies in its use of Firecracker microVMs — lightweight virtual machines originally developed by Amazon Web Services — to create completely isolated environments for AI-generated code execution. This addresses a fundamental security challenge: AI agents often need to run untrusted code that could potentially damage systems or access sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When talking to customers and special enterprises, their biggest decision is almost always build versus buy,” Mlejnsky explained in an interview. “With the build versus buy solution, it all really comes down to whether you want to spend next six to 12 months building this hiring five to 10 person infrastructure team that will cost you at least half a million dollars…or you can use our plug and play solution.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform supports multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, and C++, and can spin up new computing environments in approximately 150 milliseconds — fast enough to maintain the real-time responsiveness users expect from AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprise customers particularly value E2B’s open-source approach and deployment flexibility. Companies can self-host the entire platform for free or deploy it within their own virtual private clouds (VPCs) to maintain data sovereignty — a critical requirement for Fortune 100 firms handling sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-perfect-timing-as-microsoft-layoffs-signal-shift-toward-ai-worker-replacement"&gt;Perfect timing as Microsoft layoffs signal shift toward AI worker replacement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The funding comes at a pivotal moment for AI agent technology. Recent advances in large language models have made AI agents increasingly capable of handling complex, real-world tasks. Microsoft recently laid off thousands of employees while expecting AI agents to perform previously human-only work, Mlejnsky pointed out in our interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, infrastructure limitations have constrained AI agent adoption. Industry data suggests fewer than 30% of AI agents successfully make it to production deployment, often due to security, scalability, and reliability challenges that E2B’s platform aims to solve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re building the next cloud,” Mlejnsky said, outlining the company’s ambitious vision. “The current world runs on Cloud 2.0, which was made for humans. We’re building the open-source cloud for AI agents where they can be autonomous and run securely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The market opportunity appears substantial. Code generation assistants already produce at least 25% of the world’s software code, while JPMorgan Chase saved 360,000 hours annually through document processing agents. Enterprise leaders expect to automate 15% to 50% of manual tasks using AI agents, creating massive demand for supporting infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-open-source-strategy-creates-defensive-moat-against-tech-giants-like-amazon-and-google"&gt;Open-source strategy creates defensive moat against tech giants like Amazon and Google&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E2B faces potential competition from cloud giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, which could theoretically replicate similar functionality. However, the company has built competitive advantages through its open-source approach and focus on AI-specific use cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t really care” about the underlying virtualization technology, Mlejnsky explained, noting that E2B focuses on creating an open standard for how AI agents interact with computing resources. “We are even like actually partnering with a lot of these cloud providers too, because a lot of enterprise customers actually want to deploy E2B inside their AWS account.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s open-source sandbox protocol has become a de facto standard, with hundreds of millions of compute instances demonstrating its real-world effectiveness. This network effect makes it difficult for competitors to displace E2B once enterprises have standardized on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alternative solutions like Docker containers, while technically possible, lack the security isolation and performance characteristics required for production AI agent deployments. Building similar capabilities in-house typically requires 5-10 infrastructure engineers and at least $500,000 in annual costs, according to Mlejnsky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-features-like-24-hour-sessions-and-20-000-concurrent-sandboxes-drive-fortune-100-adoption"&gt;Enterprise features like 24-hour sessions and 20,000 concurrent sandboxes drive Fortune 100 adoption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E2B’s enterprise success stems from features specifically designed for large-scale AI deployments. The platform can scale from 100 concurrent sandboxes on the free tier to 20,000 concurrent environments for enterprise customers, with each sandbox capable of running for up to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advanced enterprise features include comprehensive logging and monitoring, network security controls, and secrets management — capabilities essential for Fortune 100 compliance requirements. The platform integrates with existing enterprise infrastructure while providing the granular controls security teams demand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have very strong inbound,” Mlejnsky noted, describing the sales process. “Once we tackle the 87% we will come back for those 13%.” Customer objections typically focus on security and privacy controls rather than fundamental technology concerns, indicating broad market acceptance of the core value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-insight-partners-21m-bet-validates-ai-infrastructure-as-next-major-software-category"&gt;Insight Partners’ $21M bet validates AI infrastructure as next major software category&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insight Partners‘ investment reflects growing investor confidence in AI infrastructure companies. The global software investor, which manages over $90 billion in regulatory assets, has invested in more than 800 companies worldwide and seen 55 portfolio companies achieve initial public offerings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insight Partners is excited to back E2B’s visionary team as they pioneer essential infrastructure for AI agents,” said Praveen Akkiraju, Managing Director at Insight Partners. “Such rapid growth and enterprise adoption can be difficult to achieve, and we believe that E2B’s open-source sandbox standard will become a cornerstone of secure and scalable AI adoption across the Fortune 100 and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investment will fund expansion of E2B’s engineering and go-to-market teams in San Francisco, development of additional platform features, and support for the growing customer base. The company plans to strengthen its open-source sandbox protocol as a universal standard while developing enterprise-grade modules like secrets vault and monitoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-infrastructure-play-that-could-define-enterprise-ai-s-next-chapter"&gt;The infrastructure play that could define enterprise AI’s next chapter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A group of 20 national security experts and former government officials wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday urging the Trump administration to reverse its recent decision to let Nvidia resume selling its H20 AI chips in China.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter called the Trump administration’s recent decision a “strategic misstep” that will have detrimental effects on the U.S.’s AI “edge” for both military and civilian use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter specifically called out H20’s AI inference, the process of using a trained AI model to make decisions on unseen data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The H20 is a potent accelerator of China’s frontier AI capabilities, not an outdated AI chip,” the letter stated. “Designed specifically to work around export control thresholds, the H20 is optimized for inference, the process responsible for the dramatic capabilities gains made by the latest generation of frontier AI reasoning models. For inference tasks, the H20 outperforms even the H100, an AI chip this administration has restricted access to due to its advanced capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter also claimed that selling the H20 chips in China will worsen the existing AI chip bottleneck in the U.S.; that these chips could be used to support China’s military; and that this decision will weaken overall chip export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The decision to ban H20 exports earlier this year was the right one,” the letter said. “We ask you to stand by that principle and continue blocking the sale of advanced AI chips to China as America works to maintain its technological edge. This is not a question of trade. It is a question of national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This letter comes two weeks after the DOC gave Nvidia the green light to start selling its AI chips in China again in relation to ongoing trade discussions with China regarding rare earth elements. At the time, Lutnick tried to downplay the decision and said Nvidia’s H20 was the company’s “fourth best” AI chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Samsung’s giant new Texas fab will be dedicated to making Tesla’s next-generation AI6 chip,” Elon Musk posted on X late Sunday evening. “The strategic importance of this is hard to overstate.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tesla’s AI6 (AKA Hardware 6) chip is the company’s bet on an all-in-one chip design that can scale from powering its driver assistance system known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots, all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk noted Tesla is working with TSMC to make AI5 chips, which just finished the design. The AI5, a generation that is primarily built for FSD, will initially be made in TSMC’s Taiwan factory and then at its Arizona facility.&amp;nbsp;Samsung already makes the AI4 chip, according to Musk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal is a boost for Samsung, which struggled to get its chip-making project off the ground after failing to attract and retain major clients. Musk said in another post that Tesla may end up spending more than $16.5 billion on Samsung chips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Actual output is likely to be several times higher,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a later post, Musk said Samsung agreed to allow Tesla to assist in maximizing manufacturing efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tesla switched over from Nvidia’s Drive platform to its own custom chip in 2019. That chip, known as the FSD Computer (FSDC) or Hardware 3, launched that year in all of its EVs.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since then, the company’s attention to its custom chips has expanded along with its ambitions.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Samsung’s giant new Texas fab will be dedicated to making Tesla’s next-generation AI6 chip,” Elon Musk posted on X late Sunday evening. “The strategic importance of this is hard to overstate.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tesla’s AI6 (AKA Hardware 6) chip is the company’s bet on an all-in-one chip design that can scale from powering its driver assistance system known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots, all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk noted Tesla is working with TSMC to make AI5 chips, which just finished the design. The AI5, a generation that is primarily built for FSD, will initially be made in TSMC’s Taiwan factory and then at its Arizona facility.&amp;nbsp;Samsung already makes the AI4 chip, according to Musk.&lt;/p&gt;

It attempts to create a secure and organised way for AI models to use external tools and data. MCP has become popular because it’s relatively simple and has the backing of a major AI player. However, it’s really designed for a single AI to use different tools, not for a team of AIs to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s where other protocols like the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and the Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) come in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACP, an open-source project from IBM, is all about enabling AI agents to communicate as peers. It’s built on familiar web technologies that developers are already comfortable with, which makes it easy to adopt. It’s a flexible and powerful solution that allows for a more decentralised and collaborative approach to AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s A2A protocol, meanwhile, takes a slightly different tack. It’s designed to work alongside MCP, rather than replace it. A2A is focused on how a team of AIs can work together on complex tasks, passing information and responsibilities back and forth. It uses a system of ‘Agent Cards,’ like digital business cards, to help AIs find and understand each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real difference between these protocols is their vision for the future of how AI agents communicate.

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porn sites may have blown up Meta's key defense in a copyright fight with book authors who earlier this year said that Meta torrented "at least 81.7 terabytes of data across multiple shadow libraries" to train its AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta has defeated most of the authors' claims and claimed there is no proof that Meta ever uploaded pirated data through seeding or leeching on the BitTorrent network used to download training data. But authors still have a chance to prove that Meta may have profited off its massive piracy, and a new lawsuit filed by adult sites last week appears to contain evidence that could help authors win their fight, TorrentFreak reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new lawsuit was filed last Friday in a US district court in California by Strike 3 Holdings—which says it attracts "over 25 million monthly visitors" to sites that serve as "ethical sources" for adult videos that "are famous for redefining adult content with Hollywood style and quality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After authors revealed Meta's torrenting, Strike 3 Holdings checked its proprietary BitTorrent-tracking tools designed to detect infringement of its videos and alleged that the company found evidence that Meta has been torrenting and seeding its copyrighted content for years—since at least 2018. Some of the IP addresses were clearly registered to Meta, while others appeared to be "hidden," and at least one was linked to a Meta employee, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta’s AI training tactics may have harmed minors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Strike 3 Holdings, Meta "willfully and intentionally" infringed "at least 2,396 movies" as part of a strategy to download terabytes of data as fast as possible by seeding popular high-quality porn. Supposedly, Meta continued seeding the content "sometimes for days, weeks, or even months" after downloading them, and these movies may also have been secretly used to train Meta's AI models, Strike 3 Holdings alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The porn site operator explained to the court that BitTorrent's protocol establishes a "tit-for-tat" mechanism that "rewards users who distribute the most desired content." It alleged that Meta took advantage of this system by "often" pirating adult videos that are "often within the most infringed files on BitTorrent websites" on "the very same day the motion pictures are released."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;These tactics allegedly gave Meta several advantages, making it harder for Strike 3 Holdings' sites to compete, including potentially distributing the videos to minors for free without age checks in states that now require them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Meta specifically targeted Plaintiffs’ content for distribution in order to accelerate its downloads of vast amounts of other content," the lawsuit said. And while Meta claimed that it "wrote a script to intentionally limit distributing popular books on BitTorrent," Strike 3 Holdings believes "discovery will likely show" Meta "continuously" distributed its adult videos specifically as a strategy to get around the BitTorrent protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Strike 3 Holdings says it has documented at least five episodes in which Meta "hand-picked" adult videos from a specific site for "intense periods of distribution" to avoid seeding other content it was sourcing through BitTorrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The only reason to incur the server and bandwidth expense of remaining in a swarm for these long durations is to leverage the extended distribution as tit-for-tat currency in order to efficiently download millions of other files from BitTorrent," Strike 3 Holdings alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strike 3 Holdings is seeking extensive damages and an injunction to permanently stop Meta from pirating its videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also wants Meta to delete any stolen videos from its AI training data and existing AI models. The company alleged that Meta could use its high-quality copyrighted works—which provide rare long cuts of "natural, human-centric imagery" showing "parts of the body not found in regular videos" and "unique" forms "of human interactions and facial expressions"—to create a rival adult video generator that could "eventually create identical content for little to no cost."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Plaintiffs cannot compete against Meta when it ignores federal and state laws and offers Plaintiffs’ works for free," Strike 3 Holdings alleged. "This will effectively eliminate Plaintiffs’ future ability to compete in the marketplace" as well as its brands' "hard-earned reputations as respected and ethical sources for high-quality adult motion pictures by potentially allowing minors unfettered access to Plaintiffs’ content against Plaintiffs’ consent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars could not immediately reach Meta, Strike 3 Holdings' in-house lawyer, or book authors' lawyers for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Evidence may prove Meta seeded more content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking evidence to back its own copyright infringement claims, Strike 3 Holdings searched "its archive of recorded infringement captured by its VXN Scan and Cross Reference tools" and found 47 "IP addresses identified as owned by Facebook infringing its copyright protected Works."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data allegedly demonstrates a "continued unauthorized distribution" over "several years." And Meta allegedly did not stop its seeding after Strike 3 Holdings confronted the tech giant with this evidence—despite the IP data supposedly being verified through an industry-leading provider called Maxmind.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta also allegedly attempted to "conceal its BitTorrent activities" through "six Virtual Private Clouds" that formed a "stealth network" of "hidden IP addresses," the lawsuit alleged, which seemingly implicated a "major third-party data center provider" as a partner in Meta's piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of these IP addresses allegedly found "data patterns that matched infringement patterns seen on Meta’s corporate IP Addresses" and included "evidence of other activity on the BitTorrent network including ebooks, movies, television shows, music, and software." The seemingly non-human patterns documented on both sets of IP addresses suggest the data was for AI training and not for personal use, Strike 3 Holdings alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most shockingly, considering that a Meta employee joked "torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn’t feel right," Strike 3 Holdings further alleged that it found "at least one residential IP address of a Meta employee" infringing its copyrighted works. That suggests Meta may have directed an employee to torrent pirated data outside the office to obscure the data trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adult site operator did not identify the employee or the major data center discussed in its complaint, noting in a subsequent filing that it recognized the risks to Meta's business and its employees' privacy of sharing sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, the company alleged that evidence shows "well over 100,000 unauthorized distribution transactions" linked to Meta's corporate IPs. Strike 3 Holdings is hoping the evidence will lead a jury to find Meta liable for direct copyright infringement or charge Meta with secondary and vicarious copyright infringement if the jury finds that Meta successfully distanced itself by using the third-party data center or an employee's home IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Meta has the right and ability to supervise and/or control its own corporate IP addresses, as well as the IP addresses hosted in off-infra data centers, and the acts of its employees and agents infringing Plaintiffs’ Works through their residential IPs by using Meta’s AI script to obtain content through BitTorrent," the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porn sites may have blown up Meta's key defense in a copyright fight with book authors who earlier this year said that Meta torrented "at least 81.7 terabytes of data across multiple shadow libraries" to train its AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta has defeated most of the authors' claims and claimed there is no proof that Meta ever uploaded pirated data through seeding or leeching on the BitTorrent network used to download training data. But authors still have a chance to prove that Meta may have profited off its massive piracy, and a new lawsuit filed by adult sites last week appears to contain evidence that could help authors win their fight, TorrentFreak reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new lawsuit was filed last Friday in a US district court in California by Strike 3 Holdings—which says it attracts "over 25 million monthly visitors" to sites that serve as "ethical sources" for adult videos that "are famous for redefining adult content with Hollywood style and quality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After authors revealed Meta's torrenting, Strike 3 Holdings checked its proprietary BitTorrent-tracking tools designed to detect infringement of its videos and alleged that the company found evidence that Meta has been torrenting and seeding its copyrighted content for years—since at least 2018. Some of the IP addresses were clearly registered to Meta, while others appeared to be "hidden," and at least one was linked to a Meta employee, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta’s AI training tactics may have harmed minors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Strike 3 Holdings, Meta "willfully and intentionally" infringed "at least 2,396 movies" as part of a strategy to download terabytes of data as fast as possible by seeding popular high-quality porn. Supposedly, Meta continued seeding the content "sometimes for days, weeks, or even months" after downloading them, and these movies may also have been secretly used to train Meta's AI models, Strike 3 Holdings alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The porn site operator explained to the court that BitTorrent's protocol establishes a "tit-for-tat" mechanism that "rewards users who distribute the most desired content." It alleged that Meta took advantage of this system by "often" pirating adult videos that are "often within the most infringed files on BitTorrent websites" on "the very same day the motion pictures are released."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;These tactics allegedly gave Meta several advantages, making it harder for Strike 3 Holdings' sites to compete, including potentially distributing the videos to minors for free without age checks in states that now require them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Meta specifically targeted Plaintiffs’ content for distribution in order to accelerate its downloads of vast amounts of other content," the lawsuit said. And while Meta claimed that it "wrote a script to intentionally limit distributing popular books on BitTorrent," Strike 3 Holdings believes "discovery will likely show" Meta "continuously" distributed its adult videos specifically as a strategy to get around the BitTorrent protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Strike 3 Holdings says it has documented at least five episodes in which Meta "hand-picked" adult videos from a specific site for "intense periods of distribution" to avoid seeding other content it was sourcing through BitTorrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The only reason to incur the server and bandwidth expense of remaining in a swarm for these long durations is to leverage the extended distribution as tit-for-tat currency in order to efficiently download millions of other files from BitTorrent," Strike 3 Holdings alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strike 3 Holdings is seeking extensive damages and an injunction to permanently stop Meta from pirating its videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also wants Meta to delete any stolen videos from its AI training data and existing AI models. The company alleged that Meta could use its high-quality copyrighted works—which provide rare long cuts of "natural, human-centric imagery" showing "parts of the body not found in regular videos" and "unique" forms "of human interactions and facial expressions"—to create a rival adult video generator that could "eventually create identical content for little to no cost."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Plaintiffs cannot compete against Meta when it ignores federal and state laws and offers Plaintiffs’ works for free," Strike 3 Holdings alleged. "This will effectively eliminate Plaintiffs’ future ability to compete in the marketplace" as well as its brands' "hard-earned reputations as respected and ethical sources for high-quality adult motion pictures by potentially allowing minors unfettered access to Plaintiffs’ content against Plaintiffs’ consent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars could not immediately reach Meta, Strike 3 Holdings' in-house lawyer, or book authors' lawyers for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Evidence may prove Meta seeded more content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking evidence to back its own copyright infringement claims, Strike 3 Holdings searched "its archive of recorded infringement captured by its VXN Scan and Cross Reference tools" and found 47 "IP addresses identified as owned by Facebook infringing its copyright protected Works."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data allegedly demonstrates a "continued unauthorized distribution" over "several years." And Meta allegedly did not stop its seeding after Strike 3 Holdings confronted the tech giant with this evidence—despite the IP data supposedly being verified through an industry-leading provider called Maxmind.&lt;/p&gt;

The feature, which will be available by clicking an icon just to the left of the web address in the browser, will display a pop-up that informs consumers about the store’s reputation for things like product quality, shopping, pricing, customer service, and returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature, which is currently available only in English, will generate the summaries based on reviews from partners, including Bazaarvoice, Bizrate Insights, Reputation.com, Reseller Ratings, ScamAdviser, Trustpilot, TurnTo, Yotpo, Verified Reviews, and others.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature will initially be available to Chrome on the desktop. When reached for comment, Google could not confirm if or when AI summaries would come to mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="an example of the store reviews feature in Google Chrome, seen inside the browser window" class="wp-image-3031554" height="802" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chrome-store-summaries.png" width="1080" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google says the goal with the summaries is to provide a safer and more efficient shopping experience. However, the feature also helps Google better compete with other AI features rolled out by retail giant Amazon, which has been using the new technology to summarize product ratings and reviews, help customers find clothes that fit, get product recommendations and comparisons, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The changes arrive as Google, for the first time in many years, is facing a potential competitive threat to Chrome’s dominance in the global browser market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;New AI-powered browsers like Perplexity’s Comet, The Browser Company’s Dia, Opera Neon, and perhaps a challenger from OpenAI have the search giant thinking about how to infuse AI more directly into its own web browser. For example, Google is developing an AI agent that would be able to take control of Chrome for you to take actions on your behalf. Plus, the company recently added support for its Gemini AI assistant in Chrome for Gemini subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move is also part of a broader initiative underway at Google to make it more of a modern-day shopping platform for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Already, the company has tapped AI to help customers locate the products they’re interested in, get personalized product recommendations, and virtually try on clothes, and it has been developing tools for better price tracking, shopping in Google’s AI Mode, and AI-powered agentic checkout. (The latter two were announced at this year’s Google I/O developer conference. Google recently announced that getting outfit and room inspiration in AI Mode would roll out this fall.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google on Monday announced an update to its Chrome web browser that will introduce AI-generated store reviews to U.S. shoppers with the aim of helping to determine the best places to make a purchase. The feature, which will be available by clicking an icon just to the left of the web address in the browser, will display a pop-up that informs consumers about the store’s reputation for things like product quality, shopping, pricing, customer service, and returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It all started, incongruously, with a few op-eds he wrote for TechCrunch about anti-trust enforcement in social media.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The commentaries apparently caught the attention of some folks in Washington D.C., Liss told TechCrunch, and resulted in him being invited to guest judge a war game capstone exercise in spring 2023 hosted by the National War College. The war game was very &lt;em&gt;au courant&lt;/em&gt;, running a scenario in which the U.S. and China fought for supremacy over Taiwan and the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Liss’s take away from the exercise? “Our core supply chain of the arsenal of democracy — literally, the ships that my grandfather fought in — we don’t have the ship-building capacity. If we did, we don’t have the steel to make it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At that point, Liss said he became “really interested — obsessed, even” with the steel supply chain. “That was really the birth of Nemo Industries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The basic pitch for Nemo Industries, Liss’s latest startup, appears&amp;nbsp;as though it were drawn from a Venn diagram of two very American anxieties, steelmaking and AI. The company, until now, has been operating in stealth, but Liss gave TechCrunch a peek behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First, the obvious part: Nemo will use AI to optimize the production of pig iron, modernizing an industry that Liss said is woefully outdated. “These plants are run on, at best, Excel spreadsheets. At worst, clipboard technology,” he said. The people who run them have “unbelievable expertise,” he added, but that’s the sort of thing that doesn’t scale well.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Liss isn’t pitching Nemo as just another piece of industrial software. Rather, Nemo is planning to build its own furnaces. The decision was driven by Liss’s conviction that companies which use AI from inception will have a “20% to 30% margin advantage” over competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In steelmaking, such conviction doesn’t come cheap. Hyundai Motor Group said in March that it would build a $6 billion steel plant in Louisiana to supply its factories in the U.S. Nemo’s plant may not cost that much since its operations will be focused on pig iron, an intermediate product which steelmakers use to make a range of different alloys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nemo will fire its furnaces using natural gas, which releases less carbon dioxide than coal, which is commonly used in the iron and steel industry. Liss said the company is considering capturing the furnaces’ carbon pollution; tax incentives introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act remain largely intact, and they make the endeavor profitable for Nemo, he said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Liss’s partner in Nemo is Michael DuBose, an investor who previously worked at Cheniere Energy, a natural gas company. “He’s built billions of dollars in LNG infrastructure,” Liss said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup will need that sort of scale if it’s to succeed. Nemo previously raised $28.2 million, according to PitchBook, and it is currently in talks with existing investors to raise a $100 million Series A with existing investors, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The company also has received offers for over $1 billion in incentives from two southern states if the company can build three plants over the course of 15 years, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a tall order for anyone to tackle, but Liss said that sort of ambition is required if the steel industry is going to deliver the sort of returns desired by venture capitalists. And, he added, basic industries like steel have historically delivered big wins for investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When you look at the history of our country, many of the greatest companies that created outsize outcomes for their initial investors were in these categories,” Liss said. “Ultimately, what were the Rockefellers and the Carnegies and the Melons and the Fricks investing in? The dollar amounts are so big in these categories.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1474110149.jpeg?resize=1200,985" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Daniel Liss, co-founder of the social network Dispo and the dating app Teaser AI, is convinced he’s onto the next big thing: steelmaking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
