&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s how Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun described the blowback after OpenAI researchers did a victory lap over GPT-5’s supposed math breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis added, “this is embarrassing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Decoder reports that in a since-deleted tweet, OpenAI VP Kevin Weil declared that “GPT-5 found solutions to 10 (!) previously unsolved Erdős problems and made progress on 11 others.” (“Erdős problems” are famous conjectures posed by mathematician Paul Erdős.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, mathematician Thomas Bloom, who maintains the Erdos Problems website, said Weil’s post was “a dramatic misrepresentation” — while these problems were indeed listed as “open” on Bloom’s website, he said that only means, “I personally am unaware of a paper which solves it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In other words, it’s not accurate to claim GPT-5 was able to solve previously unsolved problems. Instead, Bloom wrote, “GPT-5 found references, which solved these problems, that I personally was unaware of.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sebastien Bubeck, an OpenAI researcher who’d also been touting GPT-5’s accomplishments, then acknowledged that “only solutions in the literature were found,” but he suggested this remains a real accomplishment: “I know how hard it is to search the literature.”&lt;/p&gt;
