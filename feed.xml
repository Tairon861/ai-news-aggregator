&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Thursday, Google announced a partnership with Reliance, India’s largest company by market capitalization, to offer its AI Pro subscription free for 18 months to eligible Jio users. The alliance comes just three months after Perplexity teamed up with Reliance’s archrival Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom operator, to provide free access to Perplexity Pro for Airtel’s 360 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India, the world’s most populous nation and the second-largest internet market with over a billion users, has long been an irresistible target for global tech firms. While the country has not yet seen a major homegrown AI breakthrough, U.S. tech giants increasingly view it as the next big frontier — a place to gather diverse data, refine models, and test AI use cases that could later scale across other emerging markets. The latest partnership between Google and Reliance is a clear reflection of that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Jio offer will initially reach users aged 18 to 25 before expanding to all Jio subscribers nationwide, the companies said. It includes access to Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model via the Gemini app, higher limits for generating AI images and videos with Nano Banana and Veo 3.1, expanded use of Notebook LM for study and research, and 2 TB of cloud storage across Google Photos, Gmail, Drive, and WhatsApp backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This partnership will also explore bringing more delightful local experiences powered by AI to Jio users,” the Indian telecom giant said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 18-month offer is valued at ₹35,100 (about $396), the companies said. Google’s AI Pro plan normally costs ₹1,950 (around $22) per month in India and includes a free one-month trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond the consumer offer, Reliance also partnered with Google Cloud to broaden access to its tensor processing units (TPUs) in India. Reliance’s AI subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence, will become a strategic go-to-market partner for Google Cloud to expand Gemini Enterprise across Indian organizations and will develop its own prebuilt AI agents for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Today’s announcement will put Google’s cutting-edge AI tools in the hands of consumers, businesses, and India’s vibrant developer community,” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its 48th annual general meeting in late August, Reliance announced partnerships with its investors Google and Meta to strengthen its AI infrastructure in India through a newly created subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence. Reliance and Meta also committed to setting up a joint venture with a combined investment of ₹8.55 billion (approximately $100 million), with a 70/30 ownership split.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this week, Google rival OpenAI announced plans to offer free access to its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan to all users in India starting November 4. The entry-level tier, launched locally in August, has since expanded to 17 countries across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic are also setting up shop in India, hoping to learn more about local users and grow their reach in the world’s biggest emerging market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this year, Google offered Indian students a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan. That promotion ran until September 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has already helped drive adoption of U.S.-led AI platforms and ranks among the top consumer markets for tools such as Google’s Nano Banana, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Anthropic’s Claude. Extending free access to paid AI versions could further accelerate adoption and cement India’s position as a key growth consumer market for generative AI offerings. However, it remains to be seen how India will translate into meaningful revenue for these AI companies once the current wave of free bundling offers runs its course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Through our collaboration with strategic and long-term partners like Google, we aim to make India not just AI-enabled but AI-empowered — where every citizen and enterprise can harness intelligent tools to create, innovate, and grow,” Ambani said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gemini.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;In a push to expand its AI footprint in emerging markets, Google has partnered with billionaire Mukesh Ambani–led Reliance Industries to bundle its AI Pro subscription with Jio 5G plans at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run by the nonprofit Health Within Reach Foundation, the Women Cancer Screening Van runs an AI solution by MedCognetics, a Dallas, Texas-based company that’s part of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital mammography machine aboard the van has to date screened mammogram data from more than 3,500 patients — 90% of whom had never had a mammogram before. This data is triaged onsite with the help of the AI solution by MedCognetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Developing countries generally have a lot of load on their existing healthcare institutions,” said Dr. Mudassar Shaikh, chief medical officer of the Health Within Reach Foundation. “This tech-enabled mobile healthcare program is solving a lot of healthcare access problems because, with the help of AI, we are able to bring high-quality care to peoples’ doorsteps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the thousands of mammograms the foundation has conducted in the last year in rural areas surrounding Pune, India, about 8% — 300 or so — returned abnormal findings. The foundation refers these patients to expert doctors in the city for further testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using our software built with NVIDIA technology, they identified 24 cancer-positive patients and connected them to treatment before the disease could progress further,” said Ron Nag, CEO and president of MedCognetics. “This is the way I want to see AI implemented around the world, to help people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Infographic with stats on the Women Cancer Screening Van: 3,500 mammograms conducted through the mobile clinic, 90% of patients had never had a mammogram before, ~300 abnormal findings identified, and 24 confirmed breast cancer diagnoses." class="alignnone wp-image-86895 size-large" height="672" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/medcog-stats-1680x672.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;MedCognetics Advances AI Screening Capabilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MedCognetics produces AI systems that are FDA-cleared as software as a medical device. They can be deployed on the NVIDIA IGX Orin industrial-grade edge AI platform with the NVIDIA Holoscan platform for real-time sensor processing — or on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs hosted in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s suite of software for breast cancer screening includes algorithms for cancer triage, as well as features being prepared for regulatory submission such as cancer detection, breast density assessment and a risk analysis model that forecasts a patient’s likelihood of contracting breast cancer within a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the integration of IGX Orin, the team is developing additional capabilities including image denoising, also being prepared for regulatory submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_86898"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-full wp-image-86898" height="220" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/medcog-screening.png" width="806" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-86898"&gt;Enhanced digital mammography requires two separate images to be captured, increasing the likelihood of patient motion causing artifacts on the image. MedCognetics’ AI models can help realign the images to present radiologists with a clearer view. Image on left does not include motion suppression — image on right does.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edge AI Bridges the Healthcare Accessibility Gap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MedCognetics’ critical contribution to the Health Within Reach Women Cancer Screening Van is rapid inference using India-based cloud resources, which lets staff quickly identify high-risk cases and connect to radiologists for prioritized reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Radiologists don’t travel with the cancer screening vans — once the van comes back to its urban hub, the mammogram images are uploaded onto our system for radiologist review,” Shaikh said. “In the future, fast AI analysis through hardware on the van could let us triage patients onsite, even at the remotest of areas were connectivity is lacking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the MedCognetics software flags a potential tumor, the Health Within Reach team prioritizes that patient and immediately connects with a radiologist, sharing the patient’s mammography images for detailed analysis. This enables the radiologist to decide if additional imaging is needed and ensures that high-probability cases are escalated and attended to faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest challenges is finding small tumors,” Nag said. “When we started, all the radiologists we spoke to said they didn’t want AI to help them see tumors the size of raisins or golf balls — they wanted AI to help them see the tumors that are so small they might easily be missed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the nearly two-thirds of the Indian population residing in rural areas, future edge AI deployments could expand the reach of high-quality care to communities where preventative healthcare is rarely sought out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Breast cancer tumors are generally painless, so there is a propensity for women in communities where healthcare is expensive or hard to access to postpone screenings or further investigation,” Shaikh said. “The majority of new cases are diagnosed in advanced stages, a factor that directly affects patient survival rates. That’s where regular, affordable and easily accessible mammogram screenings can make a significant difference.”&lt;/p&gt;

AOL’s 30 million monthly active users represent an enduring brand and a data-rich resource that can be used in AI-driven services. That statement is true only if the data is properly governed and integrated. Such deals may blend nostalgia with business advantage, but present new compliance and cybersecurity risks that enterprises need to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By acquiring AOL from Yahoo, Bending Spoons moves to consolidate high-retention consumer technologies in its expanding digital portfolio. As companies turn increasingly to synthetic data to feed their AI’s learning corpus, the deal shows a different tactic, one of using established data assets and user bases to accelerate AI personalisation, advertising efficiency, and digital identity information gathering. It illustrates how older platforms – perhaps written off as legacy – can become profitable fuel for innovation when combined with cloud-native architectures and machine learning models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bending Spoons has financed its expansion strategy with a $2.8 billion debt package from major global banks that include J.P. Morgan, BNP Paribas, and HSBC. There’s clearly growing lender confidence in the long-term monetisation of data, unlike during the ‘dot.com’ boom and bust, where the emphasis and interest was in purely software products. The acquisition, expected to close by year-end, follows Bending Spoons’ planned purchase of Vimeo. The two deals, if they go through, position the company as a major consolidator of internet assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Implementation and operational challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating decades-old infrastructure like AOL’s presents technical challenges. Data migration from legacy email systems in line with current-day security protocols and compliance requirements needs careful stewardship. There’s also the not-insignificant issue of retraining staff for AI data stewardship on data that comes with significant buy-in from trusting service users. As with any digital acquisition, therefore, Bending Spoons’ success will depend on managing the technical and cultural dimensions of integration. Without strong governance, promising legacy platforms risk becoming compliance liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in any acquisition cycle, there will have been preparatory work in mapping data lineage, running integration and interoperability audits, and significant governance discussions. It’s worth noting that many integration pilots stall without shared accountability between technology and business functions: It’s easier to covet data than to work out how it can be put to business use, especially when the best an acquirer can hope for are limited examples of what they might get, once the ink has dried on the cheque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vendor and ecosystem context&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Bending Spoons operates independently of major enterprise AI ecosystems, the logic of its acquisition aligns with Microsoft’s integration of LinkedIn data into Azure AI Foundry, and IBM’s efforts to reinvigorate legacy data with watsonx. AOL’s customer base and behavioural data could feasibly hold value with cloud analytics, customer profiling, and identity management frameworks, on even off-the-shelf platforms like AWS Bedrock, Azure, or Google Vertex AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Executive takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legacy platforms are not obsolete but they are often underused and undervalued. The differentiator lies in how organisations integrate historical data into modern AI governance and value delivery. Executives may see the AOL acquisition as a nostalgia play, but it’s a more hard-nosed imagining of a pure data asset. Perhaps the next wave of competitive advantage may come not from building new systems, but from reinterpreting older software and information that’s sometimes disregarded, simply because it’s not the latest-and-greatest ‘thing.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Spoon” by felixtsao is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

As companies turn increasingly to synthetic data to feed their AI’s learning corpus, the deal shows a different tactic, one of using established data assets and user bases to accelerate AI personalisation, advertising efficiency, and digital identity information gathering. It illustrates how older platforms – perhaps written off as legacy – can become profitable fuel for innovation when combined with cloud-native architectures and machine learning models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bending Spoons has financed its expansion strategy with a $2.8 billion debt package from major global banks that include J.P. Morgan, BNP Paribas, and HSBC. There’s clearly growing lender confidence in the long-term monetisation of data, unlike during the ‘dot.com’ boom and bust, where the emphasis and interest was in purely software products. The acquisition, expected to close by year-end, follows Bending Spoons’ planned purchase of Vimeo. The two deals, if they go through, position the company as a major consolidator of internet assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Implementation and operational challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating decades-old infrastructure like AOL’s presents technical challenges. Data migration from legacy email systems in line with current-day security protocols and compliance requirements needs careful stewardship. There’s also the not-insignificant issue of retraining staff for AI data stewardship on data that comes with significant buy-in from trusting service users. As with any digital acquisition, therefore, Bending Spoons’ success will depend on managing the technical and cultural dimensions of integration. Without strong governance, promising legacy platforms risk becoming compliance liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in any acquisition cycle, there will have been preparatory work in mapping data lineage, running integration and interoperability audits, and significant governance discussions. It’s worth noting that many integration pilots stall without shared accountability between technology and business functions: It’s easier to covet data than to work out how it can be put to business use, especially when the best an acquirer can hope for are limited examples of what they might get, once the ink has dried on the cheque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vendor and ecosystem context&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Bending Spoons operates independently of major enterprise AI ecosystems, the logic of its acquisition aligns with Microsoft’s integration of LinkedIn data into Azure AI Foundry, and IBM’s efforts to reinvigorate legacy data with watsonx. AOL’s customer base and behavioural data could feasibly hold value with cloud analytics, customer profiling, and identity management frameworks, on even off-the-shelf platforms like AWS Bedrock, Azure, or Google Vertex AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Executive takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legacy platforms are not obsolete but they are often underused and undervalued. The differentiator lies in how organisations integrate historical data into modern AI governance and value delivery. Executives may see the AOL acquisition as a nostalgia play, but it’s a more hard-nosed imagining of a pure data asset. Perhaps the next wave of competitive advantage may come not from building new systems, but from reinterpreting older software and information that’s sometimes disregarded, simply because it’s not the latest-and-greatest ‘thing.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Spoon” by felixtsao is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

          &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Character.AI announced it will bar anyone under the age of 18 from open-ended chats with its AI characters starting on November 25, implementing one of the most restrictive age policies yet among AI chatbot platforms. The company faces multiple lawsuits from families who say its chatbots contributed to teenager deaths by suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next month, Character.AI says it will ramp down chatbot use among minors by identifying them and placing a two-hour daily limit on their chatbot access. The company plans to use technology to detect underage users based on conversations and interactions on the platform, as well as information from connected social media accounts. On November 25, those users will no longer be able to create or talk to chatbots, though they can still read previous conversations. The company said it is working to build alternative features for users under the age of 18, such as the ability to create videos, stories, and streams with AI characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand told The New York Times that the company wants to set an example for the industry. “We’re making a very bold step to say for teen users, chatbots are not the way for entertainment, but there are much better ways to serve them,” Anand said in the interview. The company also plans to establish an AI safety lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform currently has about 20 million monthly users, with less than 10 percent self-reporting as under 18, according to Anand. Users pay a monthly subscription fee starting at about $8 to chat with custom AI companions. (We first covered the service in September 2022 by interviewing a personification of the operating system Linux.) Until recently, Character.AI did not verify ages when people signed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits and safety concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character.AI was founded in 2021 by Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, two former Google engineers, and raised nearly $200 million from investors. Last year, Google agreed to pay about $3 billion to license Character.AI’s technology, and Shazeer and De Freitas returned to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the company now faces multiple lawsuits alleging that its technology contributed to teen deaths. Last year, the family of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III sued Character.AI, accusing the company of being responsible for his death. Setzer died by suicide after frequently texting and conversing with one of the platform’s chatbots. The company faces additional lawsuits, including one from a Colorado family whose 13-year-old daughter, Juliana Peralta, died by suicide in 2023 after using the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Character.AI announced changes, including improved detection of violating content and revised terms of service, but those measures did not restrict underage users from accessing the platform. Other AI chatbot services, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, have also come under scrutiny for their chatbots’ effects on young users. In September, OpenAI introduced parental control features intended to give parents more visibility into how their kids use the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases have drawn attention from government officials, which likely pushed Character.AI to announce the changes for under-18 chat access. Steve Padilla, a Democrat in California’s State Senate who introduced the safety bill, told The New York Times that “the stories are mounting of what can go wrong. It’s important to put reasonable guardrails in place so that we protect people who are most vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal introduced a bill to bar AI companions from use by minors. In addition, California Governor Gavin Newsom this month signed a law, which takes effect on January 1, requiring AI companies to have safety guardrails on chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bevel says it has grown more than eightfold within the past year and now reaches over 100,000 daily active users, making it one of the fastest-growing health apps in the U.S. Additionally, the company says the average user opens the app eight times per day, and retention remains above 80% at 90 days — rare metrics in a category where people often churn after reaching a short-term fitness goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We think of health as a continuous journey, not a phase,” said co-founder and CEO Grey Nguyen in an interview with TechCrunch. “Bevel meets you where you are, learns from your habits, and helps you make small changes that compound over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But with so many health companion brands, from Whoop to Oura to Eight Sleep, why does the world need another one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Aditya Agarwal, a Bevel co-founder and board member who is also a partner at venture firm South Park Commons, many of these health apps rely on accompanying hardware devices that customers must buy and maintain. Because such devices can be pricey, there’s an opportunity to create a product that’s purely software-based, giving people the flexibility to use the wearables they already own.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A $500 ring or band is out of reach for a lot of people,” said Agarwal. “[People] already generate so much valuable health data from our primary wearables and other everyday sources. We wanted to make something that was more accessible across a much larger set of people.” Bevel users pay $6 monthly or $50 annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike typical wellness apps that focus on a single area — such as steps, sleep, or nutrition — Bevel combines them into one experience. It integrates with Apple Watch and other popular wearables through Apple Health and directly syncs with continuous glucose monitors like Dexcom and Libre. Garmin and additional integrations are in development, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All this information feeds into Bevel Intelligence, the company’s core software, which analyzes and adapts recommendations to each user, learning how their body responds to stress, movement, or nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bevel’s story started with pain — literally.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before starting the company in late 2023, Nguyen, who previously led products at Sam Altman–backed Campus, and co-founder/CTO Ben Yang, who worked on machine learning at Opendoor, were building stablecoin infrastructure for enterprises.&amp;nbsp;The demanding nature of startup life led Nguyen to neglect his health, and he developed chronic back pain that went undiagnosed for months despite using wearables and seeing doctors regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Nothing pointed out what was actually causing my back pain, not even my doctors, which is crazy, right?” he said. “That’s when this idea came up. Everyone’s life is so nuanced. There are so many small things you do that stack on each other and, over time, create a chronic condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nguyen says he began piecing together his health data, tracking sleep, nutrition, and steps, and realized that issues across these areas had compounded over time. Low mobility from sitting too long, sleep problems caused by his mattress setup, and sodium-heavy meals that increased inflammation all played a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similarly, Agarwal, formerly CTO at Dropbox and an early engineer at Facebook, had gone through his own health overhaul after years of intense work left him burned out. What helped was logging his data manually — through spreadsheets and connected trackers — to rebuild his energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When he connected with Yang and Nguyen about what they were building with Bevel, he saw they had a similar vision and joined the team as a co-founder and board member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We shared the same North Star, which is helping people become more intelligent about their own health,” said Agarwal, who is also a partner at South Park Commons. The venture capital firm, alongside General Catalyst, invested $4 million into Bevel earlier this year in a seed round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With fresh capital and no plans to develop its own wearables, Bevel intends to grow its team and expand into additional health services and partnerships that make proactive health accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Bevel’s mission to democratize health through intelligence and design deeply resonates with us,” said Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst. “The level of engagement they’re seeing from users is remarkable, and it’s become part of people’s daily lives — not just another app” that they download and forget.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Most people tracking their health today end up with scattered clues. Their smartwatch shows sleep duration. A fitness app logs steps. A nutrition app counts calories. Yet few tools help people understand how all of this fits together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bevel, a New York–based startup, believes that’s the missing piece in the shift toward proactive health. The company has raised a $10 million Series A from General Catalyst to scale its AI health companion, which unifies data from wearables and daily habits across sleep, fitness, and nutrition into personalized insights.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reuters during a livestream that going public “is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we’ll have.” Now sources familiar with the matter say the ChatGPT maker is preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, with filings possible as early as the second half of 2026. However, news of the potential IPO comes as the company faces mounting losses that may have reached as much as $11.5 billion in the most recent quarter, according to one estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going public could give OpenAI more efficient access to capital and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping finance Altman’s plans to spend trillions of dollars on AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking who spoke with Reuters. Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has reportedly told some associates the company targets a 2027 IPO listing, while some financial advisors predict 2026 could be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three people with knowledge of the plans told Reuters that OpenAI has discussed raising $60 billion at the low end in preliminary talks. That figure refers to how much money the company would raise by selling shares to investors, not the total worth of the company. If OpenAI sold that amount of stock while keeping most shares private, the entire company could be valued at $1 trillion or more. The final figures and timing will likely change based on business growth and market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;An OpenAI spokesperson told Reuters that “an IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date,” adding that the company is “building a durable business and advancing our mission so everyone benefits from AGI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue grows as losses mount&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO preparations follow a restructuring of OpenAI completed on October 28 that reduced the company’s reliance on Microsoft, which has committed to investments of $13 billion and now owns about 27 percent of the company. OpenAI was most recently valued around $500 billion in private markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI started as a nonprofit in 2015, then added a for-profit arm a few years later with nonprofit oversight. Under the new structure, OpenAI is still controlled by a nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, but it gives the nonprofit a 26 percent stake in OpenAI Group and a warrant for additional shares if the company hits certain milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful OpenAI IPO could represent a substantial gain for investors, including Microsoft, SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. But even so, OpenAI faces an uphill financial battle ahead. The ChatGPT maker expects to reach about $20 billion in revenue by year-end, according to people familiar with the company’s finances who spoke with Reuters, but its quarterly losses are significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s earnings filing on Wednesday offered a glimpse at the scale of those losses. The company reported that its share of OpenAI losses reduced Microsoft’s net income by $3.1 billion in the quarter that ended September 30. Since Microsoft owns 27 percent of OpenAI under the new structure, that suggests OpenAI lost about $11.5 billion during the quarter, as noted by The Register. That quarterly loss figure exceeds half of OpenAI’s expected revenue for the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reuters during a livestream that going public “is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we’ll have.” Now sources familiar with the matter say the ChatGPT maker is preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, with filings possible as early as the second half of 2026. However, news of the potential IPO comes as the company faces mounting losses that may have reached as much as $11.5 billion in the most recent quarter, according to one estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going public could give OpenAI more efficient access to capital and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping finance Altman’s plans to spend trillions of dollars on AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking who spoke with Reuters. Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has reportedly told some associates the company targets a 2027 IPO listing, while some financial advisors predict 2026 could be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three people with knowledge of the plans told Reuters that OpenAI has discussed raising $60 billion at the low end in preliminary talks. That figure refers to how much money the company would raise by selling shares to investors, not the total worth of the company. If OpenAI sold that amount of stock while keeping most shares private, the entire company could be valued at $1 trillion or more. The final figures and timing will likely change based on business growth and market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An OpenAI spokesperson told Reuters that “an IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date,” adding that the company is “building a durable business and advancing our mission so everyone benefits from AGI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue grows as losses mount&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO preparations follow a restructuring of OpenAI completed on October 28 that reduced the company’s reliance on Microsoft, which has committed to investments of $13 billion and now owns about 27 percent of the company. OpenAI was most recently valued around $500 billion in private markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI started as a nonprofit in 2015, then added a for-profit arm a few years later with nonprofit oversight. Under the new structure, OpenAI is still controlled by a nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, but it gives the nonprofit a 26 percent stake in OpenAI Group and a warrant for additional shares if the company hits certain milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful OpenAI IPO could represent a substantial gain for investors, including Microsoft, SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. But even so, OpenAI faces an uphill financial battle ahead. The ChatGPT maker expects to reach about $20 billion in revenue by year-end, according to people familiar with the company’s finances who spoke with Reuters, but its quarterly losses are significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s earnings filing on Wednesday offered a glimpse at the scale of those losses. The company reported that its share of OpenAI losses reduced Microsoft’s net income by $3.1 billion in the quarter that ended September 30. Since Microsoft owns 27 percent of OpenAI under the new structure, that suggests OpenAI lost about $11.5 billion during the quarter, as noted by The Register. That quarterly loss figure exceeds half of OpenAI’s expected revenue for the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;With a child in college and a spouse who’s a professor, I have front-row access to the unfolding debacle that is “higher education in the age of AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, students routinely submit even “personal reflection” papers that are AI generated. (And routinely appear surprised when caught.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read a paper longer than 10 pages? Not likely—even at elite schools. Toss that sucker into an AI tool and read a quick summary instead. It’s more efficient!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the University of Illinois story that has been running around social media for the last week (and which then bubbled up into The New York Times yesterday) caught my attention as an almost perfect encapsulation of the current higher ed experience… and how frustrating it can be for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Science Discovery is an introductory course taught by statistics professor Karle Flanagan and the gloriously named computer scientist Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider, whose website features a logo that says, “Keep Nerding Out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance and participation counts for a small portion of the course grade, and the professors track this with a tool called the Data Science Clicker. Students attending class each day are shown a QR code, which, after being scanned, takes them to a multiple-choice question that appears to vary by person. They have a limited time window to answer the question—around 90 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks into this fall semester, the professors realized that &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more students were answering the questions—and thus claiming to be “present”—than were actually in the lecture hall. (The course has more than 1,000 students in it, across multiple sections.) According to the Times, “The teachers said they started checking how many times students refreshed the site and the IP addresses of their devices, and began reviewing server logs.” Students were apparently being told by people from the class when the questions were going live.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;When the professors realized how widespread this was, they contacted the 100-ish students who seemed to be cheating. “We reached out to them with a warning, and asked them, ‘Please explain what you just did,'” said Fagen-Ulmschneider in an Instagram video discussing the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologies came back from the students, first in a trickle, then in a flood. The professors were initially moved by this acceptance of responsibility and contrition… until they realized that 80 percent of the apologies were almost identically worded and appeared to be generated by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on October 17, during class, Flanagan and Fagen-Ulmschneider took their class to task, displaying a mash-up image of the apologies, each bearing the same “sincerely apologize” phrase. No disciplinary action was taken against the students, and the whole situation was treated rather lightly—but the warning was real. Stop doing this. Flanagan said that she hoped it would be a “life lesson” for the students.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a University of Illinois subreddit, students shared their own experiences of the same class and of AI use on campus. One student claimed to be a teaching assistant for the Data Science Discovery course and said that, in addition to not being present, many students would use AI to solve the (relatively easy) problems. AI tools will often “use functions that weren’t taught in class,” which gave the game away pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another TA claimed that “it’s insane how pervasive AI slop is in 75% of the turned-in work,” while another student complained about being a course assistant where “students would have a 75-word paragraph due every week and it was all AI generated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One doesn’t have to read far in these kinds of threads to find plenty of students who feel aggrieved because they were accused of AI use—but hadn’t done it. Given how poor most AI detection tools are, this is plenty plausible; and if AI detectors aren’t used, accusations often come down to a hunch.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone appears to be unhappy with the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI can be an amazing tool that can assist with coding, web searches, data mining, and textual summation—but I’m old enough to wonder just what the heck you’re doing at college if you don’t want to process arguments on your own (i.e., think and read critically) or even to write your own “personal reflections” (i.e., organize and express your deepest thoughts, memories, and feelings). Outsource these tasks often enough and you will fail to develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a book on Friedrich Nietzsche and how his madcap, aphoristic, abrasive, humorous, and provocative philosophizing can help us think better and live better in a technological age. The idea of simply reading AI “summaries” of his work—useful though this may be for some purposes—makes me sad, as the desiccated summation style of ChatGPT isn’t remotely the same as encountering a novel and complex human mind expressing itself wildly in thought and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s assuming ChatGPT hasn’t hallucinated anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So good luck, students and professors both. I trust we will eventually muddle our way through the current moment. Those who want an education only for its “credentials”—not a new phenomenon—have never had an easier time of it, and they will head off into the world to vibe code their way through life. More power to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those who value both thought and expression will see the AI “easy button” for the false promise that it is and will continue to do the hard work of engaging with ideas, including their own, in a way that no computer can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;With a child in college and a spouse who’s a professor, I have front-row access to the unfolding debacle that is “higher education in the age of AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, students routinely submit even “personal reflection” papers that are AI generated. (And routinely appear surprised when caught.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read a paper longer than 10 pages? Not likely—even at elite schools. Toss that sucker into an AI tool and read a quick summary instead. It’s more efficient!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the University of Illinois story that has been running around social media for the last week (and which then bubbled up into The New York Times yesterday) caught my attention as an almost perfect encapsulation of the current higher ed experience… and how frustrating it can be for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Science Discovery is an introductory course taught by statistics professor Karle Flanagan and the gloriously named computer scientist Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider, whose website features a logo that says, “Keep Nerding Out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance and participation counts for a small portion of the course grade, and the professors track this with a tool called the Data Science Clicker. Students attending class each day are shown a QR code, which, after being scanned, takes them to a multiple-choice question that appears to vary by person. They have a limited time window to answer the question—around 90 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks into this fall semester, the professors realized that &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more students were answering the questions—and thus claiming to be “present”—than were actually in the lecture hall. (The course has more than 1,000 students in it, across multiple sections.) According to the Times, “The teachers said they started checking how many times students refreshed the site and the IP addresses of their devices, and began reviewing server logs.” Students were apparently being told by people from the class when the questions were going live.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;When the professors realized how widespread this was, they contacted the 100-ish students who seemed to be cheating. “We reached out to them with a warning, and asked them, ‘Please explain what you just did,'” said Fagen-Ulmschneider in an Instagram video discussing the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologies came back from the students, first in a trickle, then in a flood. The professors were initially moved by this acceptance of responsibility and contrition… until they realized that 80 percent of the apologies were almost identically worded and appeared to be generated by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on October 17, during class, Flanagan and Fagen-Ulmschneider took their class to task, displaying a mash-up image of the apologies, each bearing the same “sincerely apologize” phrase. No disciplinary action was taken against the students, and the whole situation was treated rather lightly—but the warning was real. Stop doing this. Flanagan said that she hoped it would be a “life lesson” for the students.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a University of Illinois subreddit, students shared their own experiences of the same class and of AI use on campus. One student claimed to be a teaching assistant for the Data Science Discovery course and said that, in addition to not being present, many students would use AI to solve the (relatively easy) problems. AI tools will often “use functions that weren’t taught in class,” which gave the game away pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another TA claimed that “it’s insane how pervasive AI slop is in 75% of the turned-in work,” while another student complained about being a course assistant where “students would have a 75-word paragraph due every week and it was all AI generated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One doesn’t have to read far in these kinds of threads to find plenty of students who feel aggrieved because they were accused of AI use—but hadn’t done it. Given how poor most AI detection tools are, this is plenty plausible; and if AI detectors aren’t used, accusations often come down to a hunch.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Everyone appears to be unhappy with the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI can be an amazing tool that can assist with coding, web searches, data mining, and textual summation—but I’m old enough to wonder just what the heck you’re doing at college if you don’t want to process arguments on your own (i.e., think and read critically) or even to write your own “personal reflections” (i.e., organize and express your deepest thoughts, memories, and feelings). Outsource these tasks often enough and you will fail to develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a book on Friedrich Nietzsche and how his madcap, aphoristic, abrasive, humorous, and provocative philosophizing can help us think better and live better in a technological age. The idea of simply reading AI “summaries” of his work—useful though this may be for some purposes—makes me sad, as the desiccated summation style of ChatGPT isn’t remotely the same as encountering a novel and complex human mind expressing itself wildly in thought and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s assuming ChatGPT hasn’t hallucinated anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So good luck, students and professors both. I trust we will eventually muddle our way through the current moment. Those who want an education only for its “credentials”—not a new phenomenon—have never had an easier time of it, and they will head off into the world to vibe code their way through life. More power to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those who value both thought and expression will see the AI “easy button” for the false promise that it is and will continue to do the hard work of engaging with ideas, including their own, in a way that no computer can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia’s investment could rise to $1 billion if the company successfully completes the rest of the funding round, Bloomberg reported.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This wouldn’t be Nvidia’s first investment in Poolside. The company previously backed Poolside in its $500 million Series B round in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia, already a prolific investor in AI startups, has been broadening its portfolio to include diverse sectors. For example, Nvidia said it was exploring a $500 million investment into U.K.-based self-driving company Wayve in October.
