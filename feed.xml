(AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/25/who-are-ai-browsers-for/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chrome-with-ai-GettyImages-2184968624.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI launched an AI-powered web browser called ChatGPT Atlas this week, which makes me wonder: Is it finally time to ditch Safari?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That news was on our minds as Max Zeff, Sean O’Kane, and I discussed the browser landscape — including some lesser-known alternatives — on the latest episode of the Equity podcast. But it doesn’t sound like any of us will be making a big switch soon.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For one thing, Sean noted many companies have tried and ultimately failed to unseat the major browsers due to their inability to make money on the browser alone. Of course, that’s less likely to be a problem for OpenAI, with its increasingly massive funding rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Max, meanwhile, has actually tried out Atlas and other browsers that promise AI agents will do the work for you, and he said there’s a “slight efficiency gain” at best. At other times, you end up watching the agent “click around on a website” — is that something normal users are really crying out for? Plus, there are significant security risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Read a preview of our conversation below, edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthony:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m still on Safari, but as far as the search engine, which is tied to browsers, I’ve actually been trying to experiment with non-Google [options] because I’m just tired of seeing all the genAI stuff at the top of my search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I think also there’s this question of: If these AI browsers take off, what does that mean for the idea of the open web in general? You can still go to web pages, but I don’t think it would be crazy to suggest that a website is just going to become less and less important as more and more of our browsing is controlled by these AI interfaces and chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that this has been a big idea that people talk about a lot: What does the agentic web look like? And I think it is a fascinating question. People have tried to come up with all these solutions to work toward this future that [they] feel is coming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And I think that there is a certain aspect of it that reminds me of previous tech waves where it’s like, “Okay, but what is the actual experience? What is the value proposition to a consumer of using one of these tools?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And it’s just not super compelling today. I’ve tried out ChatGPT Atlas and I’ve tried out Comet and the most generous estimation of them is, it’s a slight efficiency gain. It makes you slightly more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But most of the time that I’ve tried these things, you’re slowly watching it click around on a website, doing some task that I would probably never do in the real world. I would have it, like, look up a recipe and add all of the ingredients to Instacart. I’ve never done that. I think all the tech bros always say that example in the videos, and I’m like, “I don’t know if people are doing that that much.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is just this huge gap, in the face of the tech industry right now [saying], “We’re building all these tools for the agentic web,” but why would a normal person use this? And I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean:&lt;/strong&gt; I have not used any of those [AI browsers] but that’s in large part because I’m still very much an old head when it comes to search and browsing in general — a lot of the work that I’m doing involves looking for documents, which just naturally involves looking through different discrete parts of web pages that I’m familiar with, lots of Boolean searches on Google. Maybe I’ll try these one day if Google really does up and kill Boolean search, which it feels like is coming at some point, but it’s not there yet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The thing that is interesting to me about these AI browsers is that we’ve seen other companies try to compete in the browser space and they always lose because it’s just impossible to make money on a browser as a product. And some have tried to charge up front for it, they can kind of get by for a little while, but it’s just ultimately not sustainable in the face of competing against Safari or Chrome or Firefox, for that matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What’s interesting to me … is you finally have these companies that just have infinite money, so they can ride it out as long as they want, because they’re not actually trying to make money on these things yet. Eventually they probably will, but OpenAI doesn’t need to make money on this thing in the next year or two, they can just have it out there and let it take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taki Allen, a student at Kenwood High School, told CNN affiliate WBAL, “I was just holding a Doritos bag — it was two hands and one finger out, and they said it looked like a gun.” But as a result, Allen said, “They made me get on my knees, put my hands behind my back, and cuffed me.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement shared with parents, Principal Katie Smith said the school’s security department had reviewed and canceled a gun detection alert, while Smith (who didn’t immediately realize the alert had been canceled) reported the situation to the school resource officer, who called the local police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Omnilert, the company that operates the AI gun detection system, told CNN, “We regret that this incident occurred and wish to convey our concern to the student and the wider community affected by the events that followed.” Nonetheless, Omnilert said “the process functioned as intended.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1225201409.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A high school student in Baltimore County, Maryland was reportedly handcuffed and searched after an AI security system flagged his bag of chips as a possible firearm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Such a tool could be used to add music to existing videos, or to add guitar accompaniment to an existing vocal track, sources said. It’s not clear when OpenAI plans to launch such a tool or whether it would be available as a standalone product (as opposed to integrating with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and video app Sora).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One source told The Information that OpenAI is working with some students from the Juilliard School to annotate scores as a way to provide training data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While OpenAI has launched generative music models in the past, they predate the launch of ChatGPT; more recently, the company has been developing audio models focused on text-to-speech and speech-to-text. Other companies with generative music models include Google and Suno.&lt;/p&gt;
