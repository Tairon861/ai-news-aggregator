In China, rare earth magnet manufacturers recycle significant amounts of scrap from their fabrication process, and a smaller number of magnets are collected for recycling at end of life.

In its two-part recycling process, rare earth–containing devices will first be amassed at “spoke” facilities. The devices will be shredded, and their magnet waste will be separated from steel parts and other recyclable metals before being sent to centralized “hubs,” where the company will use a chemical extraction process to recover a purified mixture of rare earth metals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, Cyclic Materials is constructing its first spoke facility in Mesa, Arizona, and its first commercial hub in Kingston, Ontario. These plants are expected to begin recycling magnets commercially next year in what is shaping up to be one of the largest such operations in the Western world.&lt;/p&gt;

Cyclic Materials says its process uses 95% less water and produces roughly 60% fewer emissions than rare earth mining does.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company is starting small, with its Kingston hub designed to recycle 500 metric tons of magnet waste a year. (By 2035, there could be over 43,000 metric tons of recyclable rare earth magnets in the US alone.) But with a list of roughly 2,000 potential device suppliers and customers, as well as more than $100 million in funding, the firm is positioning itself for global expansion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making a profit from rare earth recycling isn’t easy—it can cost more to collect and recycle rare earth magnets, which are deeply embedded in devices of different sizes and shapes, than a recycler will earn from reselling the metals. Even if rare earth metals can be recycled cost-effectively, there are only a few magnet makers outside of China to sell them to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cyclic Materials has signed agreements with a range of suppliers, including e-scooter and e-bike giant Lime and RenerCycle, which decommissions old wind turbines, to hoover up magnets wherever it can. Earlier this year, the firm announced it will sell its recycled rare earth mixture to the Brussels-based chemical company Solvay. But it will need more buyers to scale up further, which could mean waiting for the supply chain outside of China to expand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Cyclic Materials’ spoke facilities will also recycle aluminum, steel, and copper, providing additional revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cyclic Materials intends to build more spoke and hub facilities around the world, first scaling its operations in North America, then expanding to Europe and Asia.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;It also plans to keep innovating: At its R&amp;amp;D center in Kingston, the company is developing ways to address recycling challenges in specific industries, such as how to rapidly deconstruct wind turbine generators and separate out their supersized magnets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="seriesPromo__wrap--ef66c94cf04f56bc5c35c7a22ece9ac9"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LIBRARY-3.00_07_20_22.Still006.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rare earth magnets are essential for clean energy, but only a tiny fraction of the metals inside them are ever recycled.

Ather Energy builds e-scooters for the rising middle class that could help commuters ditch highly-polluting, gas-guzzling models.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While sales of Tesla or BYD cars drove electric vehicle adoption elsewhere in the world, two-wheelers have led the green energy transition in India. As one of the earliest “pure play” e-scooter makers, Ather Energy has helped drive micromobility EV penetration throughout India and boosted the shift away from carbon-emitting vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2018, the company introduced an expensive sports scooter, with features like a touchscreen dashboard, built-in navigation, and over-the-air software updates, previously unseen in two-wheelers. Today the company has two product lines: the Ather 450 (a sporty performance scooter) and the Ather Rizta (a family-friendly scooter for daily use).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Central to the company’s success has been its focus on product quality and the rider experience. Ather installs its own software, manufactures the vast majority of its hardware, and wants to invest much of the proceeds from its initial public offering into R&amp;amp;D.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key indicators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt;: Electric vehicles&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Founded&lt;/strong&gt;: 2013&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headquarters&lt;/strong&gt;: Bengaluru, India&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike competitors who either rebranded an acquired scooter or sold imported EVs from China, Ather does almost everything in-house, from its software stack to hardware design.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While emissions of individual two-wheelers is much less compared to that of a car or a larger vehicle, the sheer number of these scooters on Indian roads adds up. Two-wheelers contribute about one-third of transport emissions in India, and successful electrification could reduce their share to just 3% by 2050. Ather’s success in moving people from gas-guzzling scooters to electric could not only propel India closer to its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2070 but also reduce health impacts in a country where around 1.5 million deaths a year are from breathing polluted air.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the country’s leading EV-only scooter maker, Ather’s successful expansion could supercharge India’s shift away from fossil fuels, and help achieve the government’s goal of reducing air pollution, while also building a market presence internationally.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In mid-2024 Ather introduced the Ather Rizta, a spacious family scooter with a large seat, more storage, and fast charging, which sold over 100,000 units within a year of its launch. To catch up to well-capitalized competitors, such as Ola Electric, Ather is spending $105 million to build a third factory that aims to produce 500,000 two-wheelers a year by March 2027. It has also expanded its charging network to some 4,000 charging points and has pushed into newer markets, including Nepal and Sri Lanka.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past five years, driven by state and federal incentives, electric vehicle competition turned fierce in India. Car and scooter makers raced to capture the market, including legacy automakers TVS Motor and Bajaj Auto. Both have since zoomed past Ather, selling cheaper e-scooters and scaling faster, by leveraging their sprawling retail presence. Together, they have cornered a combined share of 40% of India’s e-scooter market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, EV adoption has grown more slowly in India than expected. Indian EV sales were 7.6% in 2024, far off pace of hitting the government’s target of 30% by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Ather to have a real impact on India’s transport emissions, it must scale significantly. The company is working to double its retail footprint to 700 stores and continue its expansion into smaller cities. But geopolitics could interfere: China’s retaliatory export ban on critical rare earth minerals in response to US tariffs announced in April caused a ripple effect; Ather said in August that it has found it hard to secure the magnets it needs for its motors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the Indian government rolls back subsidies that slashed the cost of purchasing an electric scooter, Ather plans to launch cheaper options. In mid-2024, it began transitioning to a newer battery chemistry called lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) that has lower environmental impacts, requires fewer expensive minerals, and should be about 20% cheaper than other battery packs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company isn’t profitable, but its gross profit per vehicle has been improving. Momentum seems to be building—in May, Ather reported its annual sales to March 2025 were up 42 percent compared to the year prior. Now, the company is betting that investing further into product innovation will help it take the lead in India’s two-wheeler revolution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="seriesPromo__wrap--ef66c94cf04f56bc5c35c7a22ece9ac9"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ather-rizta-charging.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than 70% of the 200 million registered vehicles in India are two-wheelers.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the country’s leading EV-only scooter maker, Ather’s successful expansion could supercharge India’s shift away from fossil fuels, and help achieve the government’s goal of reducing air pollution, while also building a market presence internationally.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In mid-2024 Ather introduced the Ather Rizta, a spacious family scooter with a large seat, more storage, and fast charging, which sold over 100,000 units within a year of its launch. To catch up to well-capitalized competitors, such as Ola Electric, Ather is spending $105 million to build a third factory that aims to produce 500,000 two-wheelers a year by March 2027. It has also expanded its charging network to some 4,000 charging points and has pushed into newer markets, including Nepal and Sri Lanka.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past five years, driven by state and federal incentives, electric vehicle competition turned fierce in India. Car and scooter makers raced to capture the market, including legacy automakers TVS Motor and Bajaj Auto. Both have since zoomed past Ather, selling cheaper e-scooters and scaling faster, by leveraging their sprawling retail presence. Together, they have cornered a combined share of 40% of India’s e-scooter market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, EV adoption has grown more slowly in India than expected. Indian EV sales were 7.6% in 2024, far off pace of hitting the government’s target of 30% by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Ather to have a real impact on India’s transport emissions, it must scale significantly. The company is working to double its retail footprint to 700 stores and continue its expansion into smaller cities. But geopolitics could interfere: China’s retaliatory export ban on critical rare earth minerals in response to US tariffs announced in April caused a ripple effect; Ather said in August that it has found it hard to secure the magnets it needs for its motors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the Indian government rolls back subsidies that slashed the cost of purchasing an electric scooter, Ather plans to launch cheaper options. In mid-2024, it began transitioning to a newer battery chemistry called lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) that has lower environmental impacts, requires fewer expensive minerals, and should be about 20% cheaper than other battery packs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company isn’t profitable, but its gross profit per vehicle has been improving. Momentum seems to be building—in May, Ather reported its annual sales to March 2025 were up 42 percent compared to the year prior. Now, the company is betting that investing further into product innovation will help it take the lead in India’s two-wheeler revolution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="seriesPromo__wrap--ef66c94cf04f56bc5c35c7a22ece9ac9"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/06/1124284/2025-climate-tech-companies-to-watch-ather-energy-premium-escooters/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 10:45:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>2025 Climate Tech Companies to Watch: Traton and its electric trucks (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/06/1124282/2025-climate-tech-companies-to-watch-traton-electric-trucks/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/P_Bus_CDE_NEO_Tourliner.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Europe gradually phases out heavy-duty diesel trucks, Traton is gearing up production of its electric models. The company is also helping to install hundreds of public chargers to aid the growth of electric freight transport across Europe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every day, trucks carry many millions of tons of cargo down roads and highways around the world. Nearly all run on diesel and make up one of the largest commercial sources of carbon emissions. Traton is producing a wide variety of zero-emission trucks that could help clean up this sector while also investing in a Europe-wide advanced charging network so other manufacturers can more easily follow suit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Europe especially, the next decade could see tremendous growth in electric truck adoption. New CO2 emission standards require new diesel trucks to essentially be phased out of production by 2040. And given that trucks typically operate for around 15 years, more owners will be considering electric models for their next purchase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, Traton is a company in transition. A subsidiary of Volkswagen, it is made up of a collection of commercial vehicle brands, including Scania, MAN, and International. While it still manufactures conventional trucks that run on fossil fuels, it’s making rapid progress in the EV space. Some of Scania’s long-haul electric semis can travel about 350 miles before needing to recharge, for example.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Its EV models are also starting to pick up in terms of sales. In the first half of 2025, Traton sold 1,250 electric models globally, which was twice as many as during the same period last year. That puts it not far behind Volvo, another market leader. Traton is now ramping up production—MAN recently opened a new factory line that can assemble electric and diesel trucks interchangeably. That should also help bring costs down, key to success for the sector—today, the price of an electric truck can be several times higher than for diesel ones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;What’s more, Traton is working to install hundreds of publicly available chargers across Europe through an industry partnership called Milence. That group has also invested in high-powered chargers that can deliver more than 1 megawatt of power to heavy-duty trucks, allowing trucks to recharge in 45 minutes or less (for comparison, rapid chargers available for cars today deliver between 50 and 350 kilowatts).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key indicators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry: &lt;/strong&gt;Electric vehicles&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Founded:&lt;/strong&gt; 2015&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headquarters: &lt;/strong&gt;Munich, Germany&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable fact: &lt;/strong&gt;One of Traton’s subsidiaries is a leading school bus manufacturer in the US and Canada, where it debuted its first electric school bus in 2021.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for impact&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moving freight produces about 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Most of that pollution (65%) comes from trucks and vans—more than cargo ships, trains, and planes &lt;em&gt;combined&lt;/em&gt;. And the World Economic Forum expects demand for road freight will triple by 2050.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Electric trucks do have a climate impact from the mining and manufacturing processes required to build them. The source of electricity that powers them—whether renewable or fossil fuels—also matters. Even so, battery-electric trucks operating in Europe today reduce emissions on average by 63% compared with diesel trucks, according to an analysis by the nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To mitigate climate change, the ICCT has said that all of the world’s major markets need to fully transition to selling only zero-emission trucks by 2040. Last year, about 90,000 electric trucks were sold globally; electric models accounted for less than 2.5 percent of total truck sales in the year prior. But market forces seem poised to accelerate this transition, and Traton is a small but growing player.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, China leads the world in electric truck production and sales. In Europe, though, sales are expected to tick up as the EU requires manufacturers of heavy-duty rigs to slash CO2 emissions from their fleets by 90% by 2040, with progressive targets leading up to that level—the first of which kicked in as of July.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s early days for electric trucking, as supply chains and charging infrastructure are built out. A large electric truck requires four to six times as many battery packs as an electric car, and securing enough batteries has proven particularly difficult for many EV firms based outside of China, where most batteries are produced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To mitigate this risk, Traton is building its own battery production, starting with facilities in Södertälje, Sweden and Nuremberg, Germany—with plans to make 50,000 battery packs a year, which could power about 10,000 heavy-duty trucks. (The company declined to say what proportion of the batteries currently used in its trucks comes from China.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company’s International brand, which operates in the US, could be hit by tariffs and see demand drop as the Trump administration moves to eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No matter what, the competition will be fierce—every major European truck manufacturer offers electric models now, and Chinese firms have already expanded internationally and built a strong customer base in markets like South America through sales of electric buses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For now, MAN is working toward its goal of delivering 1,000 electric trucks from its new manufacturing line by the year’s end. Looking ahead, Scania aims to begin selling its first heavy-duty truck compatible with megawatt chargers in February, with deliveries to follow later in the year. Through Milence, megawatt chargers are now available at three sites, in Sweden, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and will soon be installed at five more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="seriesPromo__wrap--ef66c94cf04f56bc5c35c7a22ece9ac9"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/P_Bus_CDE_NEO_Tourliner.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Europe gradually phases out heavy-duty diesel trucks, Traton is gearing up production of its electric models.

Cemvision wants to use waste materials and alternative fuels to help reduce climate pollution from cement production.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, making cement requires crushing limestone and heating it to super high temperatures, usually by burning fossil fuels. The chemical reactions also release carbon dioxide pollution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Swedish startup Cemvision made a few key production changes to reduce both emissions and the need to mine new materials. First, the company is moving away from Portland cement, the most common form of the material used currently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making Portland cement requires reaching ultra-high temperatures, over 1,450 °C (2,650 °F). Instead, Cemvision makes a material that requires lower temperatures (roughly 1,200 °C, or 2,200 °F), which reduces the amount of energy required.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company also uses alternative sources for heating. Rather than fossil fuels, Cemvision can use a combination of plasma, hydrogen, and electricity. The startup tested its process in a demonstration-scale kiln, which can make up to 12 tons per day. The material has a high strength under compression and doesn’t heat up much when it’s mixed with water, both desirable qualities for builders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Cemvision also has a strong focus on building a circular economy. The company’s cement incorporates waste materials like mine tailings and slag, a by-product of iron and steel manufacturing. And it recently published results showing that it can use steel slag from electric arc furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces. These materials reduce the need for newly-mined limestone and other virgin materials, cutting down on the carbon dioxide emitted from that material in chemical reactions taking place in the kiln.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key indicators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt;: Cement&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Founded&lt;/strong&gt;: 2019&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headquarters&lt;/strong&gt;: Stockholm, Sweden&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable fact&lt;/strong&gt;: Cemvision was a member of the Breakthrough Energy Fellows program and the Norrsken accelerator program, started by Klarna cofounder Niklas Adalberth.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The cement industry today accounts for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Cemvision’s process can reduce emissions by between 80% and 95% compared to traditional cement-making by using waste materials and alternative fuels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The company has partnerships with builders and industrial customers, including in construction and mining.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cemvision’s material will be more expensive than conventional cement, so it’ll require either policy support or customers who are willing to pay more. The European Union has a policy system that charges for pollution, and that should help make Cemvision’s cement competitive. The company says its product will be less expensive than one of the leading methods of cleaning up cement, carbon capture and sequestration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The cement industry is quite conservative, and there’s often resistance to new technologies, including adopting materials other than Portland cement. Cemvision’s cement will need to gain wide acceptance to make progress on emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cemvision has a site selected and is currently raising money to finance a full-scale plant in Northern Europe. That facility will have a capacity of 500,000 metric tons annually, and the company says it should open by 2028.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="seriesPromo__wrap--ef66c94cf04f56bc5c35c7a22ece9ac9"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cemvision_StEriksDJI_0819_1.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cement is one of the most used materials on the planet, and the industry emits billions of tons of greenhouse gasses annually.

Rather than fossil fuels, Cemvision can use a combination of plasma, hydrogen, and electricity. The startup tested its process in a demonstration-scale kiln, which can make up to 12 tons per day. The material has a high strength under compression and doesn’t heat up much when it’s mixed with water, both desirable qualities for builders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Cemvision also has a strong focus on building a circular economy. The company’s cement incorporates waste materials like mine tailings and slag, a by-product of iron and steel manufacturing. And it recently published results showing that it can use steel slag from electric arc furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces. These materials reduce the need for newly-mined limestone and other virgin materials, cutting down on the carbon dioxide emitted from that material in chemical reactions taking place in the kiln.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key indicators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt;: Cement&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Founded&lt;/strong&gt;: 2019&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headquarters&lt;/strong&gt;: Stockholm, Sweden&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable fact&lt;/strong&gt;: Cemvision was a member of the Breakthrough Energy Fellows program and the Norrsken accelerator program, started by Klarna cofounder Niklas Adalberth.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The cement industry today accounts for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Cemvision’s process can reduce emissions by between 80% and 95% compared to traditional cement-making by using waste materials and alternative fuels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The company has partnerships with builders and industrial customers, including in construction and mining.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cemvision’s material will be more expensive than conventional cement, so it’ll require either policy support or customers who are willing to pay more. The European Union has a policy system that charges for pollution, and that should help make Cemvision’s cement competitive. The company says its product will be less expensive than one of the leading methods of cleaning up cement, carbon capture and sequestration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The cement industry is quite conservative, and there’s often resistance to new technologies, including adopting materials other than Portland cement. Cemvision’s cement will need to gain wide acceptance to make progress on emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cemvision has a site selected and is currently raising money to finance a full-scale plant in Northern Europe. That facility will have a capacity of 500,000 metric tons annually, and the company says it should open by 2028.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="seriesPromo__wrap--ef66c94cf04f56bc5c35c7a22ece9ac9"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/06/1124280/2025-climate-tech-companies-to-watch-cemvision-low-emissions-cement/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 10:45:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>2025 Climate Tech Companies to Watch: Pairwise and its climate-adapted crops (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/06/1124278/2025-climate-tech-companies-to-watch-pairwise-gene-edited-crops/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/244A0057.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate change will make it increasingly difficult to grow crops across many parts of the world. Pairwise is leveraging CRISPR gene editing to develop plants that can better withstand adverse conditions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pairwise uses cutting-edge gene editing to produce crops that can withstand increasingly harsh climate conditions, helping to feed a growing population even as the world warms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The seven-year-old startup was cofounded by several gene editing pioneers, including MIT’s Feng Zhang and Harvard’s David Liu, who helped invent and improve the breakthrough CRISPR tool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, the company delivered the first food to the US market, that was developed with the precise genetic scissors, a less-bitter–tasting mustard green. It’s now working to produce crops with climate-resilient traits, through partnerships with two of the world’s largest plant biotech companies, Bayer and Corteva.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pairwise says its technology enables the company and its customers to efficiently introduce and fine-tune new plant traits. The toolkit includes a proprietary CRISPR enzyme (the part of the technology that snips off bits of DNA), as well as a base editor, a second-generation CRISPR technology that can alter a single DNA letter. Co-founder Liu first developed it with his research team.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among its early efforts, the company is developing and field testing shorter, sturdier types of corn, blackberries and other crops that could survive high winds and other extreme weather events amplified by climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company believes that these dwarf plants can be grown closer together, potentially enabling farmers to produce higher yields with less fertilizer and fewer insecticides. Growing more plants on a given area of land, or shrinking fruit trees closer to bush size, also means it could be more economical to grow their crops in agricultural hoop houses. These&amp;nbsp;temporary, movable greenhouses can be covered with plastic or shade cloth to control growing conditions. That, in turn, could enable more farmers, particularly in poorer parts of the world, to protect their crops from heatwaves and other severe weather.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In addition, Pairwise is working with the Gates Foundation to create new varieties of high-yield yams in Nigeria. It has also licensed its suite of genetic tools to Mars to help the confectionary giant develop cacao plants that would be more resilient to plant diseases and shifting climate conditions. The cacao trees, which farmers predominantly grow in West Africa, are coming under increasing stress from rising temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key indicators&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry: &lt;/strong&gt;Food and agriculture&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Founded:&lt;/strong&gt; 2018&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headquarters: &lt;/strong&gt;Durham, North Carolina, US&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable fact: &lt;/strong&gt;The company was cofounded by several scientists who were instrumental in inventing and improving CRISPR, including MIT professor Feng Zhang and Harvard professor David Liu, both of whom also have appointments at the Broad Institute.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As climate change fuels more extreme weather and creates otherwise harsher conditions such as drought, the ability to grow crops with the same or higher yields than are seen today could help sustain farmers and feed communities. Particularly in some of the hottest and poorest parts of the world, climate-adapted crops promise to prevent hunger and starvation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To date, Pairwise hasn’t delivered any climate-adapted foods to the market. So it remains to be seen how big of a difference such plants will make in the fields and on store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a general, if untested, hope that consumers and regulators will be more accepting of CRISPR-edited crops, which involve editing the plant’s own DNA, than many have been of transgenic crops, which are created by swapping in genes from another species.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pairwise representatives say the company, which has raised $155 million to date, is evaluating short-stature blackberries in field trials now.

We don’t fancy ourselves as stock pickers or financial analysts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But we still don’t want to lead our readers astray by highlighting a startup that winds up filing for bankruptcy six months later, even if its demise is due to a policy whiplash outside of its control.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So we had to shift our thinking some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a basic principle, we look for companies with the potential to substantially drive down greenhouse gas emissions or deliver products that could help communities meaningfully reduce the dangers of heatwaves, droughts, or other extreme weather.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We prefer to feature businesses that have established a track record, by raising capital, building plants, or delivering products. We generally exclude companies where the core business involves extracting and combusting fossil fuels, even if they have a side business in renewables, as well as those tied to forced labor or other problematic practices.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Our reporters and contributors add their initial ideas to a spreadsheet. We ask academics, investors, and other sources we trust for more nominees.

But given the particular challenges for the climate tech space in the US these days, one decision we made early on was to look harder and more widely for companies making strides elsewhere.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, numerous other nations continue to believe in the need to confront rising threats and the economic opportunities in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China, in particular, has seized on the energy transition as a pathway for expanding its economy and global influence, giving rise to some of the world’s largest and most innovative clean tech companies. That includes two on this year’s list: the sodium-ion battery company HiNa and the wind-turbine giant Envision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the European Union’s increasingly strict emissions mandates and cap-and-trade system are accelerating efforts to clean up the energy, heavy-industry, and transportation sectors across that continent. We highlighted two promising companies there, including the German electric truck company Traton and the Swedish clean-cement maker Cemvision.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We also determined that certain businesses could emerge relatively unscathed from the shifting conditions in the US, or perhaps even benefit from them. Notably, the fact that heightened tariffs will boost the cost of importing critical minerals could create an advantage for a company like Redwood Materials, one of the US’s biggest recyclers of battery materials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, the boom in AI data center development is opening some promising opportunities, as it spawns vast demands for new electricity generation. Several of our picks are well positioned to help meet those needs through carbon-free energy sources, including geothermal company Fervo Energy and next-generation nuclear startup Kairos Power.

Plus, Redwood Materials has launched a new microgrid business line to help address those demands as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, it was especially challenging this year to produce a list we felt confident enough to put out into the world, which is a key reason why we decided to narrow it down from 15 companies to 10.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But we believe we’ve identified a solid slate of firms around the world that are making real strides in cleaning up the way we do business and go about our lives, and which are poised to help us meet the rising climate challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We hope you think so too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="seriesPromo__wrap--ef66c94cf04f56bc5c35c7a22ece9ac9"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/06/1124275/2025-climate-tech-companies-to-watch-methodology/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 10:45:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>2025 Climate Tech Companies to Watch: HiNa Battery Technology and its effort to commercialize salt cells (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/06/1124270/2025-climate-tech-companies-to-watch-hina-battery-salt-cells/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/100-MWh-level-sodium-ion-battery-energy-storage-power-station-2.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HiNa Battery Technology is a trailblazer in developing and mass-producing batteries using sodium, a widely available element that can be extracted from sea salt.

Sodium-ion cells are made with an element 400 times more abundant than lithium. It can be found and extracted pretty much anywhere there is seawater or salt deposits in the ground, and harvesting it is a centuries-old practice. For decades, research of the technology was abandoned due to the huge commercial success of lithium-ion cells. Now, HiNa Battery Technology is working to bring sodium back to the limelight—and to the mass market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Led by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, HiNa’s goal is to commercialize sodium-ion technology in an industry dominated by lithium. To deliver that, it has built labs to develop its own chemistries and factories to make cells at scale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HiNa began mass manufacturing last year, bringing two sodium-ion products to market. One is a cube-shaped battery for storing electricity; it’s already powering commercial-scale energy storage stations in China, including one in Hubei Province that began operation in July 2024. The other product is a cylindrical battery already being used in electric mopeds (which are ubiquitous in China) and other small vehicles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Compared to their lithium counterparts, sodium-ion batteries perform better in cold environments and can charge faster, but they have lower energy density. This means a sodium-ion battery carries less energy than a lithium-ion battery of the same size—a problem for cars, since that means shorter range.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HiNa says it will continue to increase its products’ energy density through technological innovations, such as by using more-efficient materials for the cathode and anode and improving batteries’ structure. Currently, the energy density of its cube-shaped battery is 165 watt-hours per kilogram—around 80% of that of a lithium iron phosphate battery, the mainstream lithium battery in China.&lt;/p&gt;

The 50-megawatt energy storage plant in Hubei Province alone is projected to avoid an estimated 13,000 tons of carbon dioxide every year, which is roughly equivalent to removing about 3,000 gas-powered cars from the road.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HiNa faces a big question: Can sodium-ion batteries thrive commercially? Lithium-ion cells are projected to remain cheaper and more powerful in the foreseeable future. The unit price of sodium-ion batteries is currently about 60% higher than that of lithium ones, but their theoretical production cost should eventually be around a third lower than that of lithium-ion cells. Industry analysts say HiNa and other sodium-ion battery makers must ensure that customers can get more bang for their bucks in order to create a market.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chinese lithium-battery behemoths are also making moves into sodium, upping pressure on specialist companies like HiNa. CATL, the world’s largest battery maker, has said it will mass-produce sodium-ion batteries for electric cars by the end of this year. Meanwhile, EV giant BYD is building a massive factory in eastern China dedicated to making sodium-ion cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HiNa’s plan is to focus on a few submarkets. It says that sectors such as heavy trucks and energy storage represent huge potential because of China’s big domestic market.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company aims to launch a fast-charging sodium-ion battery that powers heavy trucks this month. The battery can fully charge in just 20 minutes, according to HiNa. The feature is expected to be a draw for truck drivers, who cannot afford long pit stops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="seriesPromo__wrap--ef66c94cf04f56bc5c35c7a22ece9ac9"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/100-MWh-level-sodium-ion-battery-energy-storage-power-station-2.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HiNa Battery Technology is a trailblazer in developing and mass-producing batteries using sodium, a widely available element that can be extracted from sea salt.

Many people want to blame politicians and corporations for this failure, but there’s an even more fundamental reason: We don’t have all the technological tools we need to do it, and many of the ones we do have are too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For all the progress the world has made on renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, and electricity storage, we need a lot more innovation on every front—from discovery to deployment—before we can hope to reach our ultimate goal of net-zero emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I don’t think this is a reason to be pessimistic. I see it as cause for optimism, because humans are very good at inventing things. In fact, we’ve already created many tools that are reducing emissions. In just the past 10 years, energy breakthroughs have lowered the global forecast for emissions in 2040 by 40%. In other words, because of the human capacity to innovate, we are on course to reduce emissions substantially by 2040 even if nothing else changes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And I am confident that more positive changes are coming. I’ve been learning about global warming and investing in ideas to stop it for the past 20 years. I’ve connected with unbiased scientists and innovators who are committed to preventing a climate disaster. Ten years ago, some of them joined me in creating Breakthrough Energy, an investment group whose sole purpose is to accelerate clean energy innovation. We’ve supported more than 150 companies so far, many of which have blossomed into major businesses such as Fervo Energy and Redwood Materials, two of this year’s Companies to Watch. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: Mr. Gates did not participate in the selection process of this year’s companies and was not aware that two Breakthrough investments had been selected when he agreed to write this essay.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Yet climate technologies offer more than just a public good. They will remake virtually every aspect of the world’s economy in the coming years, transforming energy markets, manufacturing, transportation, and many types of industry and food production. Some of these efforts will require long-term commitments, but it’s important that we act now. And what’s more, it’s already clear where the opportunities lie.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past decade, an ecosystem of thousands of innovators, investors, and industry leaders has emerged to work on every aspect of the problem. This&amp;nbsp;year’s list of 10 Climate Tech Companies to Watch shows just a few of the many examples.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Although much of this innovation ecosystem has matured on American shores, it has become a global movement that won’t be stopped by new obstacles in the US. It’s unfortunate that governments in the US and other countries have decided to cut funding for climate innovations and reverse some of the policies that help breakthrough ideas get to scale. In this environment, we need to be more rigorous than ever about spending our time, money, and ingenuity on efforts that will have the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How do we figure out which ones those are? First, by understanding which activities are responsible for the most emissions. I group them into five categories: electricity generation, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and heating and cooling for buildings.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the zero-carbon tools we have today aren’t distributed evenly across these sectors. In some sectors, like electricity, we’ve made a great deal of progress. In others, like agriculture and manufacturing, we’ve made much less. To compare progress across the board, I use what I call the Green Premium, which is the difference in cost between the clean way of doing something and the conventional way that produces emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, sustainable aviation fuel now costs more than twice as much as conventional jet fuel, so it has a Green Premium of over 100%. Solar and wind power have grown quickly because in many cases they’re cheaper than conventional sources of electricity—that is, they have a negative Green Premium.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Green Premium isn’t purely financial. To be competitive, clean alternatives also need to be as practical as what they’re replacing. Far more people will buy EVs once you can charge one up as quickly as you can fill your tank with gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I think the Green Premium is the best way to identify areas of great impact. Where it’s high, as in the case of jet fuel, we need innovators and investors to jump on the problem. Where it’s low or even negative, we need to overcome the barriers that are keeping the technologies from reaching a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A new technology has to overcome a lot of challenges to beat the incumbents, but being able to compete on cost is absolutely essential. So if I could offer one piece of advice to every company working on zero-carbon technologies, it would be to focus on lowering and eliminating the Green Premium in whatever sector you’ve chosen. Think big. If your technology can be competitive enough to eventually eliminate at least 1% of global emissions per year—that’s 0.5 gigatons—you’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d encourage policymakers to bring this sector-by-sector focus on the Green Premium to their work, too. They should also protect funding for clean technologies and the policies that promote them. This is not just a public good: The countries that win the race to develop these breakthroughs will create jobs, hold enormous economic power for decades to come, and become more energy independent.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;In addition, young scientists and entrepreneurs should think about how they can put their skills toward these challenges. It’s an exciting time—the people who begin a career in clean technology today will have an enormous impact on human welfare. If you need pointers, the Climate Tech Atlas published last month by Breakthrough Energy and other partners is an excellent guide to the technologies that are essential for decarbonizing the economy and helping people adapt to a warmer climate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d encourage investors to put serious money into companies with technologies that can meaningfully reduce the Green Premium. Consider it an investment in what will be the biggest growth industry of the 21st century. Companies have made dramatic progress on better and cleaner solutions in every sector; what many of them need now is private-sector capital and partnerships to help them reach the scale at which they’ll have a real impact on emissions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright has-text-align-right"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if I could offer one piece of advice to every company working on zero-carbon technologies, it would be to focus on lowering and eliminating the Green Premium in whatever sector you’ve chosen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Transforming the entire physical economy is an unprecedented task, and it can only be accomplished through markets—by supporting companies with breakthrough ideas that beat fossil fuels on cost and practicality. It’s going to take investors who are both patient and willing to accept the risk that some companies will fail. Of course, governments and nonprofits have a role in the energy transition too, but ultimately, our success will hinge on climate innovators’ ability to build profitable companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we get this right—and I believe we will—then in the next decade, we’ll see fewer news stories about missed emissions targets and more stories about how emissions are dropping fast because the world invented and deployed breakthrough ideas: clean liquid fuels that power passenger jets and cargo ships; neighborhoods built with zero-emissions steel and cement; fusion plants that generate an inexhaustible supply of clean electricity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only will emissions fall faster than most people expect, but hundreds of millions of people will be able to get affordable, reliable clean energy—with especially dramatic improvements for low-income countries. More people will have access to air-conditioning for extremely hot days. More children will have lights so they can do their homework at night. More health clinics will be able to keep their vaccines cold so they don’t spoil. We’ll have built an economy where everyone can prosper.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, climate change will still present many challenges. But the advances we make in the coming years can ensure that everyone gets a chance to live a healthy and productive life no matter where they’re born, and no matter what kind of climate they’re born into.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bill Gates is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist.

We’ve supported more than 150 companies so far, many of which have blossomed into major businesses such as Fervo Energy and Redwood Materials, two of this year’s Companies to Watch. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: Mr. Gates did not participate in the selection process of this year’s companies and was not aware that two Breakthrough investments had been selected when he agreed to write this essay.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Yet climate technologies offer more than just a public good. They will remake virtually every aspect of the world’s economy in the coming years, transforming energy markets, manufacturing, transportation, and many types of industry and food production. Some of these efforts will require long-term commitments, but it’s important that we act now. And what’s more, it’s already clear where the opportunities lie.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past decade, an ecosystem of thousands of innovators, investors, and industry leaders has emerged to work on every aspect of the problem. This&amp;nbsp;year’s list of 10 Climate Tech Companies to Watch shows just a few of the many examples.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Although much of this innovation ecosystem has matured on American shores, it has become a global movement that won’t be stopped by new obstacles in the US. It’s unfortunate that governments in the US and other countries have decided to cut funding for climate innovations and reverse some of the policies that help breakthrough ideas get to scale. In this environment, we need to be more rigorous than ever about spending our time, money, and ingenuity on efforts that will have the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How do we figure out which ones those are? First, by understanding which activities are responsible for the most emissions. I group them into five categories: electricity generation, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and heating and cooling for buildings.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the zero-carbon tools we have today aren’t distributed evenly across these sectors. In some sectors, like electricity, we’ve made a great deal of progress. In others, like agriculture and manufacturing, we’ve made much less. To compare progress across the board, I use what I call the Green Premium, which is the difference in cost between the clean way of doing something and the conventional way that produces emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, sustainable aviation fuel now costs more than twice as much as conventional jet fuel, so it has a Green Premium of over 100%. Solar and wind power have grown quickly because in many cases they’re cheaper than conventional sources of electricity—that is, they have a negative Green Premium.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Green Premium isn’t purely financial. To be competitive, clean alternatives also need to be as practical as what they’re replacing. Far more people will buy EVs once you can charge one up as quickly as you can fill your tank with gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I think the Green Premium is the best way to identify areas of great impact. Where it’s high, as in the case of jet fuel, we need innovators and investors to jump on the problem. Where it’s low or even negative, we need to overcome the barriers that are keeping the technologies from reaching a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A new technology has to overcome a lot of challenges to beat the incumbents, but being able to compete on cost is absolutely essential. So if I could offer one piece of advice to every company working on zero-carbon technologies, it would be to focus on lowering and eliminating the Green Premium in whatever sector you’ve chosen. Think big. If your technology can be competitive enough to eventually eliminate at least 1% of global emissions per year—that’s 0.5 gigatons—you’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d encourage policymakers to bring this sector-by-sector focus on the Green Premium to their work, too. They should also protect funding for clean technologies and the policies that promote them. This is not just a public good: The countries that win the race to develop these breakthroughs will create jobs, hold enormous economic power for decades to come, and become more energy independent.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;In addition, young scientists and entrepreneurs should think about how they can put their skills toward these challenges. It’s an exciting time—the people who begin a career in clean technology today will have an enormous impact on human welfare. If you need pointers, the Climate Tech Atlas published last month by Breakthrough Energy and other partners is an excellent guide to the technologies that are essential for decarbonizing the economy and helping people adapt to a warmer climate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d encourage investors to put serious money into companies with technologies that can meaningfully reduce the Green Premium. Consider it an investment in what will be the biggest growth industry of the 21st century. Companies have made dramatic progress on better and cleaner solutions in every sector; what many of them need now is private-sector capital and partnerships to help them reach the scale at which they’ll have a real impact on emissions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright has-text-align-right"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if I could offer one piece of advice to every company working on zero-carbon technologies, it would be to focus on lowering and eliminating the Green Premium in whatever sector you’ve chosen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Transforming the entire physical economy is an unprecedented task, and it can only be accomplished through markets—by supporting companies with breakthrough ideas that beat fossil fuels on cost and practicality. It’s going to take investors who are both patient and willing to accept the risk that some companies will fail. Of course, governments and nonprofits have a role in the energy transition too, but ultimately, our success will hinge on climate innovators’ ability to build profitable companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we get this right—and I believe we will—then in the next decade, we’ll see fewer news stories about missed emissions targets and more stories about how emissions are dropping fast because the world invented and deployed breakthrough ideas: clean liquid fuels that power passenger jets and cargo ships; neighborhoods built with zero-emissions steel and cement; fusion plants that generate an inexhaustible supply of clean electricity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only will emissions fall faster than most people expect, but hundreds of millions of people will be able to get affordable, reliable clean energy—with especially dramatic improvements for low-income countries. More people will have access to air-conditioning for extremely hot days. More children will have lights so they can do their homework at night. More health clinics will be able to keep their vaccines cold so they don’t spoil. We’ll have built an economy where everyone can prosper.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, climate change will still present many challenges. But the advances we make in the coming years can ensure that everyone gets a chance to live a healthy and productive life no matter where they’re born, and no matter what kind of climate they’re born into.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bill Gates is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist.

But it’s incredibly difficult to precisely predict the sorts of density changes that a given amount of solar activity would produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, experts are working on a model of the upper atmosphere to help scientists to improve their models of how solar activity affects the environment in low Earth orbit. If they succeed, they’ll be able to keep satellites safe even amid turbulent space weather, reducing the risk of potentially catastrophic orbital collisions.

  &lt;p class="gdm-rich-text__subtitle"&gt;Using advanced AI to fix critical software vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re sharing early results from our research on CodeMender, a new AI-powered agent that improves code security automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software vulnerabilities are notoriously difficult and time-consuming for developers to find and fix, even with traditional, automated methods like fuzzing. Our AI-based efforts like Big Sleep and OSS-Fuzz have demonstrated AI’s ability to find new zero-day vulnerabilities in well-tested software. As we achieve more breakthroughs in AI-powered vulnerability discovery, it will become increasingly difficult for humans alone to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CodeMender helps solve this problem by taking a comprehensive approach to code security that’s both reactive, instantly patching new vulnerabilities, and proactive, rewriting and securing existing code and eliminating entire classes of vulnerabilities in the process. Over the past six months that we’ve been building CodeMender, we have already upstreamed 72 security fixes to open source projects, including some as large as 4.5 million lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By automatically creating and applying high-quality security patches, CodeMender’s AI-powered agent helps developers and maintainers focus on what they do best — building good software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;CodeMender in action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CodeMender operates by leveraging the thinking capabilities of recent Gemini Deep Think models to produce an autonomous agent capable of debugging and fixing complex vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the CodeMender agent is equipped with robust tools that let it reason about code before making changes, and automatically validate those changes to make sure they’re correct and don’t cause regressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Animation showing CodeMender’s process for fixing vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
                
              
                
                
                  
                  &lt;div class="gdm-rich-text rich-text flex-font"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While large language models are rapidly improving, mistakes in code security could be costly. CodeMender’s automatic validation process ensures that code changes are correct across many dimensions by only surfacing for human review high-quality patches that, for example, fix the root cause of the issue, are functionally correct, cause no regressions and follow style guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of our research, we also developed new techniques and tools that let CodeMender reason about code and validate changes more effectively. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced program analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; We developed tools based on advanced program analysis that include static analysis, dynamic analysis, differential testing, fuzzing and SMT solvers. Using these tools to systematically scrutinize code patterns, control flow and data flow, CodeMender can better identify the root causes of security flaws and architectural weaknesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-agent systems:&lt;/strong&gt; We developed special-purpose agents that enable CodeMender to tackle specific aspects of an underlying problem. For example, CodeMender uses a large language model-based critique tool that highlights the differences between the original and modified code in order to verify that the proposed changes do not introduce regressions, and self-correct as needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fixing vulnerabilities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To effectively patch a vulnerability, and prevent it from re-emerging, Code Mender uses a debugger, source code browser, and other tools to pinpoint root causes and devise patches. We have added two examples of CodeMender patching vulnerabilities in the video carousel below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #1: Identifying the root cause of a vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a snippet of the agent's reasoning about the root cause for a CodeMender-generated patch, after analyzing the results of debugger output and a code search tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the final patch in this example only changed a few lines of code, the root cause of the vulnerability was not immediately clear. In this case, the crash report showed a heap buffer overflow, but the actual problem was elsewhere — an incorrect stack management of Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements during parsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #2: Agent is able to create non-trivial patches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example, the CodeMender agent was able to come up with a non-trivial patch that deals with a complex object lifetime issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agent was not only able to figure out the root cause of the vulnerability, but was also able to modify a completely custom system for generating C code within the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  

                
              
                
                
                  
                  &lt;div class="gdm-rich-text rich-text flex-font"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Proactively rewriting existing code for better security&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also designed CodeMender to proactively rewrite existing code to use more secure data structures and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, we deployed CodeMender to apply -fbounds-safety annotations to parts of a widely used image compression library called libwebp. When &lt;strong&gt;-fbounds-safety&lt;/strong&gt; annotations are applied, the compiler adds bounds checks to the code to prevent an attacker from exploiting a buffer overflow or underflow to execute arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in libwebp (CVE-2023-4863) was used by a threat actor as part of a zero-click iOS exploit. With &lt;strong&gt;-fbounds-safety&lt;/strong&gt; annotations, this vulnerability, along with most other buffer overflows in the project where we've applied annotations, would’ve been rendered unexploitable forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video carousel below we show examples of the agent’s decision-making process, including the validation steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
                
              
                
                
                  
                  &lt;div class="gdm-rich-text rich-text flex-font"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #1: Agent’s reasoning steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example, the CodeMender agent is asked to address the following &lt;strong&gt;-fbounds-safety&lt;/strong&gt; error on &lt;strong&gt;bit_depths&lt;/strong&gt; pointer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
                
              
                
                
                  
                  





&lt;figure class="single-media single-media--inline"&gt;
  

  
&lt;/figure&gt;
                
              
                
                
                  
                  &lt;div class="gdm-rich-text rich-text flex-font"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #2: Agent automatically corrects errors and test failures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another of CodeMender’s key features is its ability to automatically correct new errors and any test failures that arise from its own annotations. Here is an example of the agent recovering from a compilation error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #3: Agent validates the changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example, the CodeMender agent modifies a function and then uses the LLM judge tool configured for functional equivalence to verify that the functionality remains intact. When the tool detects a failure, the agent self-corrects based on the LLM judge's feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Making software secure for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While our early results with CodeMender are promising, we’re taking a cautious approach, focusing on reliability. Currently, all patches generated by CodeMender are reviewed by human researchers before they’re submitted upstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using CodeMender, we've already begun submitting patches to various critical open-source libraries, many of which have already been accepted and upstreamed. We’re gradually ramping up this process to ensure quality and systematically address feedback from the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll also be gradually reaching out to interested maintainers of critical open source projects with CodeMender-generated patches. By iterating on feedback from this process, we hope to release CodeMender as a tool that can be used by all software developers to keep their codebases secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will have a number of techniques and results to share, which we intend to publish as technical papers and reports in the coming months. With CodeMender, we've only just begun to explore AI’s incredible potential to enhance software security for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="gdm-rich-text__subtitle"&gt;Using advanced AI to fix critical software vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re sharing early results from our research on CodeMender, a new AI-powered agent that improves code security automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software vulnerabilities are notoriously difficult and time-consuming for developers to find and fix, even with traditional, automated methods like fuzzing. Our AI-based efforts like Big Sleep and OSS-Fuzz have demonstrated AI’s ability to find new zero-day vulnerabilities in well-tested software. As we achieve more breakthroughs in AI-powered vulnerability discovery, it will become increasingly difficult for humans alone to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CodeMender helps solve this problem by taking a comprehensive approach to code security that’s both reactive, instantly patching new vulnerabilities, and proactive, rewriting and securing existing code and eliminating entire classes of vulnerabilities in the process. Over the past six months that we’ve been building CodeMender, we have already upstreamed 72 security fixes to open source projects, including some as large as 4.5 million lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By automatically creating and applying high-quality security patches, CodeMender’s AI-powered agent helps developers and maintainers focus on what they do best — building good software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;CodeMender in action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CodeMender operates by leveraging the thinking capabilities of recent Gemini Deep Think models to produce an autonomous agent capable of debugging and fixing complex vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the CodeMender agent is equipped with robust tools that let it reason about code before making changes, and automatically validate those changes to make sure they’re correct and don’t cause regressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Animation showing CodeMender’s process for fixing vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
                
              
                
                
                  
                  &lt;div class="gdm-rich-text rich-text flex-font"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While large language models are rapidly improving, mistakes in code security could be costly. CodeMender’s automatic validation process ensures that code changes are correct across many dimensions by only surfacing for human review high-quality patches that, for example, fix the root cause of the issue, are functionally correct, cause no regressions and follow style guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of our research, we also developed new techniques and tools that let CodeMender reason about code and validate changes more effectively. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced program analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; We developed tools based on advanced program analysis that include static analysis, dynamic analysis, differential testing, fuzzing and SMT solvers. Using these tools to systematically scrutinize code patterns, control flow and data flow, CodeMender can better identify the root causes of security flaws and architectural weaknesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-agent systems:&lt;/strong&gt; We developed special-purpose agents that enable CodeMender to tackle specific aspects of an underlying problem. For example, CodeMender uses a large language model-based critique tool that highlights the differences between the original and modified code in order to verify that the proposed changes do not introduce regressions, and self-correct as needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fixing vulnerabilities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To effectively patch a vulnerability, and prevent it from re-emerging, Code Mender uses a debugger, source code browser, and other tools to pinpoint root causes and devise patches. We have added two examples of CodeMender patching vulnerabilities in the video carousel below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #1: Identifying the root cause of a vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a snippet of the agent's reasoning about the root cause for a CodeMender-generated patch, after analyzing the results of debugger output and a code search tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the final patch in this example only changed a few lines of code, the root cause of the vulnerability was not immediately clear. In this case, the crash report showed a heap buffer overflow, but the actual problem was elsewhere — an incorrect stack management of Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements during parsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #2: Agent is able to create non-trivial patches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example, the CodeMender agent was able to come up with a non-trivial patch that deals with a complex object lifetime issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agent was not only able to figure out the root cause of the vulnerability, but was also able to modify a completely custom system for generating C code within the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  

                
              
                
                
                  
                  &lt;div class="gdm-rich-text rich-text flex-font"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Proactively rewriting existing code for better security&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also designed CodeMender to proactively rewrite existing code to use more secure data structures and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, we deployed CodeMender to apply -fbounds-safety annotations to parts of a widely used image compression library called libwebp. When &lt;strong&gt;-fbounds-safety&lt;/strong&gt; annotations are applied, the compiler adds bounds checks to the code to prevent an attacker from exploiting a buffer overflow or underflow to execute arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in libwebp (CVE-2023-4863) was used by a threat actor as part of a zero-click iOS exploit. With &lt;strong&gt;-fbounds-safety&lt;/strong&gt; annotations, this vulnerability, along with most other buffer overflows in the project where we've applied annotations, would’ve been rendered unexploitable forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video carousel below we show examples of the agent’s decision-making process, including the validation steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
                
              
                
                
                  
                  &lt;div class="gdm-rich-text rich-text flex-font"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #1: Agent’s reasoning steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example, the CodeMender agent is asked to address the following &lt;strong&gt;-fbounds-safety&lt;/strong&gt; error on &lt;strong&gt;bit_depths&lt;/strong&gt; pointer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
                
              
                
                
                  
                  





&lt;figure class="single-media single-media--inline"&gt;
  

  
&lt;/figure&gt;
                
              
                
                
                  
                  &lt;div class="gdm-rich-text rich-text flex-font"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #2: Agent automatically corrects errors and test failures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another of CodeMender’s key features is its ability to automatically correct new errors and any test failures that arise from its own annotations. Here is an example of the agent recovering from a compilation error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #3: Agent validates the changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example, the CodeMender agent modifies a function and then uses the LLM judge tool configured for functional equivalence to verify that the functionality remains intact. When the tool detects a failure, the agent self-corrects based on the LLM judge's feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;OpenAI and star designer Jony Ive are grappling with a series of technical issues with their secretive new artificial intelligence device, as they push to launch a blockbuster tech product next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based startup run by Sam Altman acquired the former Apple design chief’s company io for $6.5 billion in May, but the pair have shared few details on the projects they are building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their aim is to create a palm-sized device without a screen that can take audio and visual cues from the physical environment and respond to users’ requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People familiar with their plans said OpenAI and Ive had yet to solve critical problems that could delay the device’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having hardware developed by Ive and his team—whose alluring designs of the iMac, iPod, and iPhone helped turn Apple into one of the most valuable companies in the world—obstacles remain in the device’s software and the infrastructure needed to power it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include deciding on the assistant’s “personality,” privacy issues, and budgeting for the computing power needed to run OpenAI’s models on a mass consumer device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compute is another huge factor for the delay,” said one person close to Ive. “Amazon has the compute for an Alexa, so does Google [for its Home device], but OpenAI is struggling to get enough compute for ChatGPT, let alone an AI device—they need to fix that first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person close to OpenAI said the teething troubles were simply normal parts of the product development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple people familiar with the plans said OpenAI and Ive were working on a device roughly the size of a smartphone that users would communicate with through a camera, microphone and speaker. One person suggested it might have multiple cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gadget is designed to sit on a desk or table but can also be carried around by the user. The Wall Street Journal previously reported some of the specifications around the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person said the device would be “always on” rather than triggered by a word or prompt. The device’s sensors would gather data throughout the day that would help to build its virtual assistant’s “memory.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI overtook Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s most valuable private company this week, after a deal that valued it at $500 billion. One of the ways the ChatGPT maker is seeking to justify the price tag is a push into hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to improve the “smart speakers” of the past decade, such as Amazon’s Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant, which are generally used for a limited set of functions such as listening to music and setting kitchen timers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Ive are seeking to build a more powerful and useful machine. But two people familiar with the project said that settling on the device’s “voice” and its mannerisms were a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue is ensuring the device only chimes in when useful, preventing it from talking too much or not knowing when to finish the conversation—an ongoing issue with ChatGPT.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;“The concept is that you should have a friend who’s a computer who isn’t your weird AI girlfriend... like [Apple’s digital voice assistant] Siri but better,” said one person who was briefed on the plans. OpenAI was looking for “ways for it to be accessible but not intrusive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Model personality is a hard thing to balance,” said another person close to the project. “It can’t be too sycophantic, not too direct, helpful, but doesn’t keep talking in a feedback loop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s device will be entering a difficult market. Friend, an AI companion worn as a pendant around your neck, has been criticized for being “creepy” and having a “snarky” personality. An AI pin made by Humane, a company that Altman personally invested in, has been scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, OpenAI has been on a hiring spree to build its hardware business. Its acquisition of io brought in more than 20 former Apple hardware employees poached by Ive from his alma mater. It has also recruited at least a dozen other Apple device experts this year, according to LinkedIn accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has similarly poached members of Meta’s staff working on the Big Tech group’s Quest headset and smart glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is also working with Chinese contract manufacturers, including Luxshare, to create its first device, according to two people familiar with the development that was first reported by The Information. The people added that the device might be assembled outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AMD&amp;nbsp;has agreed to&amp;nbsp;supply 6 gigawatts of&amp;nbsp;compute capacity&amp;nbsp;to OpenAI&amp;nbsp;— enough to power up to 4.5 million homes —&amp;nbsp;across multiple generations of its Instinct GPUs,&amp;nbsp;starting with the Instinct MI450 GPU. OpenAI will receive the first&amp;nbsp;gigawatt of capacity&amp;nbsp;in the second half of 2026, when the new chip is scheduled for deployment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AMD claims the MI450 series will outperform Nvidia’s comparable offerings&amp;nbsp;(Nvidia Rubin CPX) through hardware and software improvements, many of which will be made with OpenAI’s&amp;nbsp;input.&amp;nbsp;Its current MI355X and MI300X&amp;nbsp;series GPUs, currently used in some workloads for OpenAI,&amp;nbsp;are already strong for AI inference in large language models due to their large memory capacity and bandwidth.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the agreement, AMD has given OpenAI the option to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD stock, which amounts to a 10% stake. The first tranche will vest with the&amp;nbsp;initial&amp;nbsp;1 gigawatt&amp;nbsp;deployment, and additional tranches will vest as OpenAI buys up to the total 6 gigawatts, AMD said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s stake will also be directly tied to increasing AMD’s stock price milestones, with the final tranche vesting when the stock reaches $600 per share.&amp;nbsp;For context, AMD shares closed at $164.67 on Friday, but started off Monday at $222.24, up nearly 35% following news of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal comes as OpenAI works to secure as many chip partnerships as possible&amp;nbsp;in its race to build out AI infrastructure, including&amp;nbsp;five new&amp;nbsp;Stargate data centers&amp;nbsp;with a planned capacity of 7 gigawatts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are thrilled to partner with OpenAI to deliver AI&amp;nbsp;compute&amp;nbsp;at massive scale,” said Dr. Lisa Su,&amp;nbsp;chair&amp;nbsp;and CEO&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;AMD, in a statement.&amp;nbsp;“This partnership brings the best of AMD and OpenAI together to create a true win-win enabling the world’s most ambitious AI buildout and advancing the entire AI ecosystem.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The system, aptly-named CodeMender, has already contributed 72 security fixes to established open-source projects in the last six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying and patching vulnerabilities is a notoriously difficult and time-consuming process, even with the aid of traditional automated methods like fuzzing. Google DeepMind’s own research, including AI-based projects such as Big Sleep and OSS-Fuzz, has proven effective at discovering new zero-day vulnerabilities in well-audited code. This success, however, creates a new bottleneck: as AI accelerates the discovery of flaws, the burden on human developers to fix them intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CodeMender is engineered to address this imbalance. It functions as an autonomous AI agent that takes a comprehensive approach to fix code security. Its capabilities are both reactive, allowing it to patch newly discovered vulnerabilities instantly, and proactive, enabling it to rewrite existing code to eliminate entire classes of security flaws before they can be exploited. This allows human developers and project maintainers to dedicate more of their time to building features and improving software functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system operates by leveraging the advanced reasoning capabilities of Google’s recent Gemini Deep Think models. This foundation allows the agent to debug and resolve complex security issues with a high degree of autonomy. To achieve this, the system is equipped with a set of tools that permit it to analyse and reason about code before implementing any changes. CodeMender also includes a validation process to ensure any modifications are correct and do not introduce new problems, known as regressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While large language models are advancing rapidly, a mistake when it comes to code security can have costly consequences. CodeMender’s automatic validation framework is therefore essential. It systematically checks that any proposed changes fix the root cause of an issue, are functionally correct, do not break existing tests, and adhere to the project’s coding style guidelines. Only high-quality patches that satisfy these stringent criteria are surfaced for human review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance its code fixing effectiveness, the DeepMind team developed new techniques for the AI agent. CodeMender employs advanced program analysis, utilising a suite of tools including static and dynamic analysis, differential testing, fuzzing, and SMT solvers. These instruments allow it to systematically scrutinise code patterns, control flow, and data flow to identify the fundamental causes of security flaws and architectural weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system also uses a multi-agent architecture, where specialised agents are deployed to tackle specific aspects of a problem. For example, a dedicated large language model-based critique tool reveals the differences between original and modified code. This allows the primary agent to verify that its proposed changes do not introduce unintended side effects and to self-correct its approach when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one practical example, CodeMender addressed a vulnerability where a crash report indicated a heap buffer overflow. Although the final patch only required changing a few lines of code, the root cause was not immediately obvious. By using a debugger and code search tools, the agent determined the true problem was an incorrect stack management issue with Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements during parsing, located elsewhere in the codebase. In another case, the agent devised a non-trivial patch for a complex object lifetime issue, modifying a custom system for generating C code within the target project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond simply reacting to existing bugs, CodeMender is designed to proactively harden software against future threats. The team deployed the agent to apply &lt;em&gt;-fbounds-safety&lt;/em&gt; annotations to parts of libwebp, a widely used image compression library. These annotations instruct the compiler to add bounds checks to the code, which can prevent an attacker from exploiting a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is particularly relevant given that a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in libwebp, tracked as CVE-2023-4863, was used by a threat actor in a zero-click iOS exploit several years ago. DeepMind notes that with these annotations in place, that specific vulnerability, along with most other buffer overflows in the annotated sections, would have been rendered unexploitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI agent’s proactive code fixing involves a sophisticated decision-making process. When applying annotations, it can automatically correct new compilation errors and test failures that arise from its own changes. If its validation tools detect that a modification has broken functionality, the agent self-corrects based on the feedback and attempts a different solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these promising early results, Google DeepMind is taking a cautious and deliberate approach to deployment, with a strong focus on reliability. At present, every patch generated by CodeMender is reviewed by human researchers before being submitted to an open-source project. The team is gradually increasing its submissions to ensure high quality and to systematically incorporate feedback from the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers plan to reach out to maintainers of critical open-source projects with CodeMender-generated patches. By iterating on community feedback, they hope to eventually release CodeMender as a publicly available tool for all software developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DeepMind team also intends to publish technical papers and reports in the coming months to share their techniques and results. This work represents the first steps in exploring the potential of AI agents to proactively fix code and fundamentally enhance software security for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAMIA privacy attack reveals what AI models memorise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-109669" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-18.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p&gt;Advances in AI are opening extraordinary frontiers in biology. AI-assisted protein engineering holds the promise of new medicines, materials, and breakthroughs in scientific understandings. Yet these same technologies also introduce biosecurity risks and may lower barriers to designing harmful toxins or pathogens. This “dual-use” potential, where the same knowledge can be harnessed for good or misuse to cause harm, poses a critical dilemma for modern science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="great-promise-and-potential-threat"&gt;Great Promise—and Potential Threat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m excited about the potential for AI-assisted protein design to drive breakthroughs in biology and medicine. At the same time, I’ve also studied how these tools could be misused. In computer-based studies, we found that AI protein design (AIPD) tools could generate modified versions of proteins of concern, such as ricin. Alarmingly, these reformulated proteins were able to evade the biosecurity screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies, which scientists rely on to synthesize AI-generated sequences for experimental use. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our paper published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; on October 2, “Strengthening nucleic acid biosecurity screening against generative protein design tools&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;,” we describe a two-year confidential project we began in late 2023 while preparing a case study for a workshop on AI and biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;We worked confidentially with partners across organizations and sectors for 10 months to develop AI biosecurity “red-teaming” methods that allowed us to better understand vulnerabilities and craft practical solutions—”patches” that have now been adopted globally, making screening systems significantly more AI-resilient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="An illustration of the AI Protein Design red-teaming workflow. [starting at the left] an icon of a database with the heading above that reads: Database of Wild-Type Proteins of Concern.

&lt;p&gt;For structuring, methods, and process in our study, we took inspiration from the cybersecurity community, where “zero-day” vulnerabilities are kept confidential until a protective patch is developed and deployed. Following the acknowledgment by a small group of workshop attendees of a zero-day for AI in biology, we worked closely with stakeholders—including synthesis companies, biosecurity organizations, and policymakers—to rapidly create and distribute patches that improved detection of AI-redesigned protein sequences. We delayed public disclosure until protective measures were in place and widely adopted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dilemma-of-disclosure"&gt;Dilemma of Disclosure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dual use dilemma also complicates how we share information about vulnerabilities and safeguards. Across AI and other fields, researchers face a core question: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-spectrum is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can scientists share potentially risk-revealing methods and results in ways that enable progress without offering a roadmap for misuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We recognized that our work itself—detailing methods and failure modes—could be exploited by malicious actors if published openly. To guide decisions about what to share, we held a multi-stakeholder deliberation involving government agencies, international biosecurity organizations, and policy experts. Opinions varied: some urged full transparency to maximize reproducibility—and to help others to build on our work; others stressed restraint to minimize risk. It was clear that a &lt;em&gt;new model of scientific communication&lt;/em&gt; was needed, one that could balance openness and security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-novel-framework"&gt;The Novel Framework&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The risk of sharing dangerous information through biological research has become a growing concern. We have participated in community-wide discussion on the challenges, including a recent National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine workshop and study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In preparing our manuscript for publication, we worked on designing a process to limit the spread of dangerous information while still enabling scientific progress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address the dual challenges, we devised a tiered access system for data and methods, implemented in partnership with the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science (IBBIS)&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing science while reducing catastrophic risks. The system works as follows:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlled access&lt;/strong&gt;: Researchers can request access through IBBIS, providing their identity, affiliation, and intended use. Requests are reviewed by an expert biosecurity committee, ensuring that only legitimate scientists conducting relevant research gain access.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stratified tiers of information&lt;/strong&gt;: Data and code are classified into several tiers according to their potential hazard, from low-risk summaries through sensitive technical data to critical software pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safeguards and agreements&lt;/strong&gt;: Approved users sign tailored usage agreements, including non-disclosure terms, before receiving data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilience and longevity&lt;/strong&gt;: Provisions are built in for declassification when risks subside, and for succession of stewardship to trusted organizations should IBBIS be unable to continue its operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This framework allows replication and extension of our work while guarding against misuse. Rather than relying on secrecy, it provides a durable system of responsible access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To ensure continued funding for the storage and responsible distribution of sensitive data and software, and for the operation of the sharing program, we provided an endowment to IBBIS to support the program &lt;em&gt;in perpetuity&lt;/em&gt;. This approach was modeled after the One Hundred Year Study on AI at Stanford, which is endowed to continue for the life of the university.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="an-important-step-in-scientific-publishing"&gt;An Important Step in Scientific Publishing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are pleased that the leadership at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; accepted our approach to handling information hazards. To our knowledge, this is the first time a leading scientific journal has formally endorsed a tiered-access approach to manage an information hazard. This recognition validates the idea that rigorous science and responsible risk management can coexist—and that journals, too, can play a role in shaping how sensitive knowledge is shared. We acknowledge the visionary leadership at &lt;em&gt;Science,&lt;/em&gt; including editors, Michael Funk and Valda Vinson, and Editor-in-Chief, Holden Thorp.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="beyond-biology-a-model-for-sensitive-research"&gt;Beyond Biology: A Model for Sensitive Research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While developed for AI-powered protein design, our approach offers a generalizable model for dual-use research of concern (DURC) across disciplines. Whether in biology, chemistry, or emerging technologies, scientists will increasingly confront situations where openness and security pull in opposite directions. Our experience shows that these values can be balanced: with creativity, coordination, and new institutional mechanisms, science can uphold both reproducibility and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We hope this framework becomes a template for future projects, offering a way forward for researchers who wish to share their insights without amplifying risks. By embedding resilience into &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; knowledge is communicated—not just &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is communicated—we can ensure that scientific progress continues to serve humanity safely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The responsible management of information hazards is no longer a peripheral concern: it is central to how science will advance in the age of powerful technologies like AI. This approach to managing information hazards demonstrates a path forward, where novel frameworks for access and stewardship allow sensitive but vital research to be shared, scrutinized, and extended responsibly. Approaches like this will be critical to ensuring that scientific openness and societal safety advance hand-in-hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind every emerging technology is a great idea propelling it forward. In the Microsoft Research Podcast series &lt;em&gt;Ideas&lt;/em&gt;, members of the research community at Microsoft discuss the beliefs that animate their research, the experiences and thinkers that inform it, and the positive human impact it targets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI has been described as a “dual use” technology: the capabilities that can be leveraged for good can also potentially be used to cause harm. In this episode, Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz and his guests—Bruce Wittmann, a senior applied scientist at Microsoft; Tessa Alexanian&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;, a technical lead at the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science (IBBIS);&amp;nbsp;and James Diggans&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;, a vice president at Twist Bioscience—explore this idea in the context of AI-powered protein design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Horvitz at the lead, Alexanian, Diggans, and Wittmann were part of a cross-sector team that demonstrated toxic protein candidates could be designed with help from AI—and that they could bypass the systems in place to defend against their creation. The project, known as the &lt;em&gt;Paraphrase Project&lt;/em&gt;, culminated in a cybersecurity-style response, a more robust protein screening system, and a modified approach to peer review with implications for how we think about and tackle AI risk more broadly. The work was recently published in &lt;em&gt;Science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[MUSIC]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ERIC HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;You’re&amp;nbsp;listening to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ideas&lt;/em&gt;, a Microsoft Research Podcast that dives deep into the world of technology research and the profound questions behind the code.&amp;nbsp;I’m&amp;nbsp;Eric Horvitz, Microsoft’s chief scientific officer, and in this series, we explore the technologies shaping our future and the&amp;nbsp;big ideas&amp;nbsp;that propel them forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[MUSIC FADES]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today,&amp;nbsp;I’m&amp;nbsp;excited to talk about the Paraphrase Project, an effort I co-led exploring how&amp;nbsp;advances in&amp;nbsp;AI tools&amp;nbsp;for protein design&amp;nbsp;might&amp;nbsp;impact&amp;nbsp;biosecurity. The results were reported in our recent paper,&amp;nbsp;“Strengthening nucleic acid biosecurity screening against generative protein design tools,”&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;published in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;on Oct. 2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joining me are&amp;nbsp;three&amp;nbsp;of the larger set of&amp;nbsp;coauthors on that paper:&amp;nbsp;Bruce Wittmann, senior applied scientist at Microsoft;&amp;nbsp;James&amp;nbsp;Diggans, vice president at Twist Bioscience and chair of the board for the International Gene Synthesis Consortium;&amp;nbsp;and Tessa Alexanian, technical lead at the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science, also known as &lt;em&gt;IBBIS&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



				&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class="show-more-show-less-toggleable-content" id="show-more-show-less-toggle-1"&gt;
					



&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s&amp;nbsp;rewind two years.&amp;nbsp;Almost to&amp;nbsp;the day, Bruce and I uncovered a vulnerability. While preparing a case study for a workshop on AI and biosecurity, we discovered that open-source AI protein design tools could be used to redesign toxic proteins in ways that could bypass biosecurity screening systems, systems set up to&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp;incoming orders of concern.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now in that work, we&amp;nbsp;created an AI pipeline from open-source tools that could&amp;nbsp;essentially “paraphrase” the amino acid sequences—reformulating&amp;nbsp;them while&amp;nbsp;working to&amp;nbsp;preserve&amp;nbsp;their structure and potentially their function.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These paraphrased sequences could evade the screening systems used by major DNA&amp;nbsp;synthesis companies, and these are the systems that scientists rely on to safely produce AI-designed proteins.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, experts in the field described this finding as the first “zero day” for AI and biosecurity.&amp;nbsp;And this&amp;nbsp;marked the beginning of a deep, two-year collaborative effort to investigate and address this challenge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the help of a&amp;nbsp;strong&amp;nbsp;cross-sector team—including James, Tessa, Bruce, and many others—we worked behind the scenes to build AI biosecurity&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;red-teaming approaches&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;probe for vulnerabilities, and to design practical fixes. These “patches,” akin to those in cybersecurity,&amp;nbsp;have now been shared with&amp;nbsp;organizations&amp;nbsp;globally to strengthen biosecurity screening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has been one of the most fascinating projects&amp;nbsp;I’ve&amp;nbsp;had the privilege to work on, for its technical complexity, its ethical and policy dimensions, and the remarkable collaboration across industry, government, and nonprofit sectors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project highlights that the&amp;nbsp;same AI tools capable of&amp;nbsp;incredible&amp;nbsp;good can also be misused, requiring us to be vigilant, thoughtful, and creative so we continue to get the most benefit out of AI tools while working to ensure&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;we avoid costly misuses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With that, let me officially welcome our guests.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bruce, James, Tessa, welcome to the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRUCE WITTMANN: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks, Eric.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMES DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks for having us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s been such a pleasure working closely with each of you, not only for your expertise but also for your deep commitment and passion about public health and global safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the technical side of things, I’d like to ask each of you, how did you get into this field? What inspired you to become biologists and then pursue the implications of advances in AI for biosecurity? Bruce?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Well, I’ve always liked building things. That’s where I would say I come from. You know, my hobbies when I’m not working on biology or AI things—as you know, Eric—is, like, building things around the house, right. Doing construction. That kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But my broader interests have always been biology, chemistry. So I originally got into organic chemistry. I found that was fascinating. From there, went to synthetic biology, particularly metabolic engineering, because that’s kind of like organic chemistry, but you’re wiring together different parts of an organism’s metabolism rather than different chemical reactions. And while I was working in that space, I, kind of, had the thought of there’s got to be an easier way to do this [LAUGHS] because it is really difficult to do any type of metabolic engineering. And that’s how I got into the AI space, trying to solve these very complicated biological problems, trying to build things that we don’t necessarily even understand using our understanding from data or &lt;em&gt;deriving&lt;/em&gt; understanding from data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, you know, that’s the roundabout way of how I got to where I am—the abstract way of how I got to where I am.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;And, Tessa, what motivated you to jump into this area and zoom into biology and biosciences and helping us to avoid &lt;em&gt;catastrophic&lt;/em&gt; outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I mean, probably the origin of me being really excited about biology is actually a book called &lt;em&gt;[The] Lives of [a] Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; by Lewis Thomas, which is an extremely beautiful book of essays that made me be like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, wow, life is just incredible&lt;/em&gt;. I think I read it when I was, you know, 12 or 13, and I was like, &lt;em&gt;Life is incredible. I want to work on this. This is the most beautiful science&lt;/em&gt;, right. And then I, in university, I was studying engineering, and I heard there was this engineering team for engineering biology—this iGEM&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; team—and I joined it, and I thought, &lt;em&gt;Oh, this is so cool. I really got to go work in this field of synthetic biology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then I also tried doing the wet lab biology, and I was like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, but I don’t like this part&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;I don’t actually, like, like babysitting microbes.&lt;/em&gt; [LAUGHTER] I think there’s a way … some people who are great wet lab biologists are made of really stern stuff. And they really enjoy figuring out how to redesign their negative controls so they can figure out whether it was contamination or whether it was, you know, temperature fluctuation. I’m not that, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so I ended up becoming a lab automation engineer because I could help the science happen, but I … but my responsibilities were the robots and the computers rather than the microbes, which I find a little bit intransigent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Right. I was thinking of those tough souls; they also used their mouths to do pipetting and so on of these contaminated fluids …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN: &lt;/strong&gt;Not anymore. &lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s true. [LAUGHTER]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;Not anymore. [LAUGHS]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN:&lt;/strong&gt; They used to be tougher. They used to be tougher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;James.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS:&lt;/strong&gt; So I did my undergrad in computer science and microbiology, mostly because at the time, I couldn’t pick which of the two I liked more. I liked them both. And by the time I graduated, I was lucky enough that I realized that the intersection of the two could be a thing. And so I did a PhD in computational biology, and then I worked for five years at the MITRE Corporation. It’s a nonprofit. I got the chance to work with the US biodefense community and just found an incredible group of people working to protect forces and the population at large from biological threats and just learned a ton about both biology and also dual-use risk. And then so when Twist called me and asked if I wanted to join Twist and set up their biosecurity program, I leapt at the chance and have done that for the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, thanks everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I believe that AI-powered protein design in particular is one of the most exciting frontiers of modern science. It holds promise for breakthroughs in medicine, public health, even material science. We’re already seeing it lead to new vaccines, novel therapeutics, and—on the scientific front—powerful insights into the machinery of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So there’s much more ahead, especially in how AI can help us promote wellness, longevity, and the prevention of disease. But before we get too far ahead, while some of our listeners work in bioscience, many may not have a good understanding of some of the foundations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, Bruce, can you just give us a high-level overview of proteins? What are they? Why are they important? How do they figure into human-designed applications?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure. Yeah. Fortunately, I used to TA a class on AI for protein design, so it’s right in my wheelhouse. [LAUGHS]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Perfect, perfect background. [LAUGHS]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;It’s perfect. Yeah. I got to go back to all of that. Yeah, so from the very basic level, proteins are the workhorses of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every chemical reaction that happens in our body—well, nearly every chemical reaction that happens in our body—most of the structure of our cells, you name it. Any life process, proteins are central to it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now proteins are encoded by what are known as … well, I shouldn’t say encoded. They are &lt;em&gt;constructed&lt;/em&gt; from what are called amino acids—there are 20 of them—and depending on the combination and order in which you string these amino acids together, you get a different protein sequence. So that’s what we mean when we say protein sequence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sequence of a protein then determines what shape that protein folds into in a cell, and that shape determines what the protein does. So we will often say sequence determines structure, which determines function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the challenge that we face in engineering proteins is just how many possibilities there are. For all practical purposes, it’s infinite. So we have 20 building blocks. There are on average around 300 amino acids in a protein. So that’s 20 to the power of 300 possible combinations. And a common reference point is that it’s estimated there are around 10 to the 80 particles in the observable universe. So beyond astronomical numbers of possible combinations that we could have, and the job of a protein engineer is to find that one or a few of the proteins within that space that do what we want it to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So when a human has an idea of, OK, here’s what I want a protein to do, we have various techniques of finding that desired protein, one of which is using artificial intelligence and trying to either sift through that milieu of potential proteins or, as we’ll talk about more in this podcast, physically generating them. So creating them in a way, sampling them out of some distribution of reasonable proteins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Great. So I wanted to throw it to James now to talk about how protein design goes from computer to reality—from in silico to test tubes. What role does Twist Bioscience&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; play in transforming digital protein designs into synthesized proteins? And maybe we can talk also about what safeguards are in place at your company and why do we need them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;So all of these proteins that Bruce has described are encoded in DNA. So the language that our cells use to kind of store the information about how to make these proteins is all encoded in DNA. And so if you as an engineer have designed a protein and you want to test it to see if it does what you think it does, the first step is to have the DNA that encodes that protein manufactured, and companies like Twist carry out that role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we are cognizant also, however, that these are what are called &lt;em&gt;dual-use technologies&lt;/em&gt;. So you can use DNA and proteins for an incredible variety of amazing applications. So drug development, agricultural improvements, bioindustrial manufacturing, all manner of incredible applications. But you could also potentially use those to cause harm so toxins or other, you know, sort of biological misuse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so the industry has since at least 2010 recognized that they have a responsibility to make sure that when we’re asked to make some sequence of DNA that we understand what that thing is encoding and who we’re giving it for. So we’re screening both the customer that’s coming to us and we’re screening the sequence that they’re requesting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so Twist has long invested in a very, sort of, complicated system for essentially reverse engineering the constructs that we’re asked to make so that we understand what they are. And then a system where we engage with our customers and make sure that they’re going to use those for legitimate purpose and responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;And how do the emergence of these new generative AI tools influence how you think about risk?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;A lot of the power of these AI tools is they allow us to make proteins or design proteins that have never existed before in nature to carry out functions that don’t exist in the natural world. That’s an extremely powerful capability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the existing defensive tools that we use at DNA synthesis companies generally rely on what’s called homology, similarity to known naturally occurring sequences, to determine whether something might pose risk. And so AI tools kind of break the link between those two things.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Now you also serve as chair of the International Gene Synthesis Consortium&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;. Can you tell us a little bit more about the IGSC, its mission, how it supports global biosecurity?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;Certainly. So the IGSC was founded in 2010[1] and right now has grown to more than 40 companies and organizations across 10 countries. And the IGSC is essentially a place where companies who might be diehard competitors in the market around nucleic acid synthesis come together and design and develop best practices around biosecurity screening to, kind of, support the shared interest we all have in making sure that these technologies are not subject to misuse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks, James. Now, Tessa, your organization, IBBIS&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; is focused—it’s a beautiful mission—on advancing science while minimizing &lt;em&gt;catastrophic&lt;/em&gt; risk, likelihood of &lt;em&gt;catastrophic&lt;/em&gt; risk. When we say catastrophic risk, what do we really mean, Tessa, in the context of biology and AI? And how is that … do you view that risk landscape as evolving as AI capabilities are growing?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the … to be honest, as a person who’s been in biosecurity for a while, I’ve been surprised by how much of the conversation about the risks from advances in artificial intelligence has centered on the risk of engineered biological weapons and engineered pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even recently, there was a new discussion on introducing redlines for AI that came up at the UN General Assembly. And the very first item they list in their list of risks, if I’m not mistaken, was engineered pandemics, which is exactly the sort of thing that people fear could be done, could be done with these biological AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, I think that when we talk about catastrophic risk, we talk about, you know, something that has an impact on a large percentage of humanity. And I think the reason that we think that biotechnologies pose a catastrophic risk is that we believe there, as we’ve seen with many historical pandemics, there’s a possibility for something to emerge or be created that is beyond our society’s ability to control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, there were a few countries in COVID that managed to more or less successfully do a zero-COVID policy, but that was not, that was not most countries. That was not any of the countries that I lived in. And, you know, we saw millions of people die. And I think we believe that with something like the 1918 influenza, which had a much higher case fatality rate, you could have far more people die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, why we think about this in the context of AI and where this connects to DNA synthesis is that, you know, there is a … these risks of both, sort of, public health risks, pandemic risks, and misuse risks—people deliberately trying to do harm with biology, as we’ve seen from the long history of biological weapons programs—you know, we think that those might be accelerated in a few different ways by AI technology, both the potential … and I say potential here because as everyone who has worked in a wet lab—which I think is everyone on this call—knows, engineering biology is really difficult. So there’s maybe a potential for it to become easier to develop biological technology for the purposes of doing harm, and there’s maybe also the potential to create novel threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so I think people talk about both of those, and people have been looking hard for possible safeguards. And I think one safeguard that exists in this biosecurity world that, for example, doesn’t exist as cleanly in the cybersecurity world is that none of these biological threats can do harm until they are realized in physical reality, until you actually produce the protein or produce the virus or the microorganism that could do harm. And so I think at this point of production, both in DNA synthesis and elsewhere, we have a chance to introduce safeguards that can have a really large impact on the amount of risk that we’re facing—as long as we develop those safeguards in a way that keeps pace with AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, thanks, Tessa. So, Bruce, our project began when I posed a challenge to you of the form: could current open-source AI tools be tasked with rewriting toxic protein sequences in a way that preserves their native structure, and might they evade today’s screening systems?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I was preparing for a global workshop on AI and biosecurity that I’d been organizing with Frances Arnold, David Baker, and Lynda Stuart, and I wanted a concrete case study to challenge attendees. And what we found was interesting and deeply concerning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to dive in with you, Bruce, on the technical side. Can you describe some about the generative pipeline and how it works and what you did to build what we might call an AI and biosecurity red-teaming pipeline for testing and securing biosecurity screening tools?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure. Yeah. I think the best place to start with this is really by analogy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An analogy I often use in this case is the type of image generation AI tools we’re all familiar with now where I can tell the AI model, “Hey, give me a cartoonish picture of a dog playing fetch.” And it’ll do that, and it’ll give us back something that is likely never been seen before, right. That exact image is new, but the theme is still there. The theme is this dog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s kind of the same technology that we’re using in this red-teaming pipeline. Only rather than using plain language, English, we’re passing in what we would call conditioning information that is relevant to a protein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So our AI models aren’t at the point yet where I can say, “Give me a protein that does &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.” That would be the dream. We’re a long way from that. But what instead we do is we pass in things that match that theme that we’re interested in. So rather than saying, “Hey, give me back the theme on a dog,” we pass in information that we know will cause or at least push this generative model to create a protein that has the characteristics that we want.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So in the case of that example you just mentioned, Eric, it would be the protein structure. Like I mentioned earlier, we usually say structure determines function. There’s obviously a lot of nuance to that, but we can, at a first approximation, say structure determines function. So if I ask an AI model, ”Hey, here’s this structure; give me a protein sequence that folds to this structure,” just like with that analogy with the dog, it’s going to give me something that matches that structure but that is likely still never been seen before. It’s going to be a new sequence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So you can imagine taking this one step further. In the red-teaming pipeline, what we would do is take a protein that should normally be captured by DNA synthesis screening—that &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be captured by DNA synthesis screening—find its structure, pass it through one of these models, and get variants on the theme of that structure so these new sequences, these synthetic homologs that you mentioned, &lt;em&gt;paraphrased&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;reformulated&lt;/em&gt;, whatever phrase we want to use to describe them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And they have a chance or a greater chance than &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; of maintaining the structure and so maintaining the function while being sufficiently different that they’re not detected by these tools anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So that’s the nuts and bolts of how the red-teaming pipeline comes together. We use more tools than just structure. I think structure is the easiest one to understand. But we have a suite of tools in there, each pass different conditioning information that causes the model to generate sequences that are paraphrased versions of potential proteins of concern.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;But to get down to brass tacks, what Bruce did for the framing study was … we took the toxic, well-known toxic protein ricin, as we described in a framing paper that’s actually part of the appendix now to the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; publication, and we generated through this pipeline, composed of open-source tools, thousands of AI-rewritten versions of ricin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And this brings us to the next step of our project, way back when, at the early … in the early days of this effort, where Twist Bioscience was one of the companies we approached with what must have seemed like an unusual question to your CEO, in fact, James: would you be open to testing whether current screening systems could detect thousands of AI-rewritten versions of ricin, a well-known toxic protein?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And your CEO quickly connected me with you, James. So, James, what were your first thoughts on hearing about this project, and how did you respond to our initial framing study?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;I think my first response was gratitude and excitement. So it was fantastic that Microsoft had really leaned forward on this set of ideas and had produced this dataset. But to have it, you know, show up on our doorstep in a very concrete way with a partner that was ready to, sort of, help us try and address that, I think was a really … a valuable opportunity. And so we really leapt at that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ:&lt;/strong&gt; And the results were that both for you and another company, major producer IDT [Integrated DNA Technologies], those thousands of variants flew through … flew under the radar of the biosecurity screening software as we covered in that framing paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, after our initial findings on this, we quietly shared the paper with a few trusted contacts, including some in government. Through my work with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, or OSTP, we connected up with biosecurity leads there, and it was an OSTP biosecurity lead who described our results as the first &lt;em&gt;zero day&lt;/em&gt; in AI and biosecurity. And now in cybersecurity, a zero day is a vulnerability unknown to defenders generally, meaning there’s no time to respond before it could be exploited should it be known.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that vein, we took a cybersecurity approach. We stood up a CERT—C-E-R-T—a &lt;em&gt;cybersecurity [computer] emergency response team&lt;/em&gt; approach used in responding to cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and we implemented this process to address what we saw as a vulnerability with AI-enabled challenges to biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one point down the line, it was so rewarding to hear you say, James, “I’m really glad Microsoft got here first.” I’m curious how you think about this kind of AI-enabled vulnerability compared to other ones, biosecurity threats, you’ve encountered, and I’d love to hear your perspective on how we handled the situation from the early discovery to the coordination and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I think in terms of comparison known threats, the challenge here is really there is no good basis on which we can just, sort of, say, &lt;em&gt;Oh, I’ll build a new tool to detect this concrete universe of things&lt;/em&gt;, right. This was more a pattern of I’m going to use tools—and I love the name “Paraphrase”; it’s a fantastic name—I can paraphrase anything that I would normally think of as biological … as &lt;em&gt;posing&lt;/em&gt; biological risk, and now that thing is harder to detect for existing tools. And so that really was a very eye-opening experience, and I think the practice of forming this CERT response, putting together a group of people who were well versed not just in the threat landscape but also in the defensive technologies, and then figuring out how to mitigate that risk and broaden that study, I think, was a really incredibly valuable response to the entire synthesis industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and, Bruce, can you describe a little bit about the process by which we expanded the effort beyond our initial framing study to more toxins and then to a larger challenge set and then the results that we pursued and achieved?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yeah, of course. So, you know, using machine learning lingo, you don’t want to &lt;em&gt;overfit&lt;/em&gt; to a single example. So early on with this, as part of the framing study, we were able to show or I should say James and coworkers across the screening field were able to show that this could be patched, right. We needed to just make some changes to the tools,&amp;nbsp;and we could at the very least detect ricin or reformulated versions of ricin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the next step of course was then, OK, how generalizable are these patches? Can they detect other reformulated sequences, as well? So we had to expand the set of proteins that we had reformulated. We couldn’t just do 10s of thousands of ricins. We had to do 10s of thousands of name your other potentially hazardous …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;I think we had 72, was it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;It was 72 in the end that we ended up at. I believe, James, it was you and maybe Jake, another one of the authors on the list … on the paper, who primarily put that list together …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;This is Jacob Beal … Jacob Beal at Raytheon BBN.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN: &lt;/strong&gt;I think James actually might be the better one to answer how this list was expanded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Initially the focus [was] on ricin as a toxin so that list expanded to 62 sort of commonly controlled toxins that are subject to an export control restriction or other concern. And then on top of that, we added 10 viral proteins. So we didn’t really just want to look at toxins. We also wanted to look at viral proteins, largely because those proteins tend to have multiple functions. They have highly constrained structures. And so if we could work in a toxin context, could Paraphrase also do the same for viral proteins, as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;And, Bruce, can you describe some about how we characterize the updates and the, we’ll say, the boost in capabilities of the patched screening tools?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt; So we had, like you said, Eric, 72 base proteins or template proteins. And for each of those, we had generated a few 100 to a couple thousand reformulated variants of them. The only way to really get any sense of validity of those sequences was to predict their structures. So we predicted protein structures for I think it was 70ish thousand protein structures in the end that we had to predict and score them using in silico metrics. So things like, how similar is this to that template, wild-type protein structure that we used as our conditioning information?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We put them on a big grid. So we have two axes. We have on the x-axis—and this is a figure in our paper—the quality of the prediction. It’s essentially a confidence metric: how realistic is this protein sequence? And on the other axis is, how similar is the predicted structure of this variant to the original? And ultimately, what we were wanting to see was the proteins that scored well in both of those metrics, so that showed up in the top right of that diagram, were caught primarily, because these are again the ones that are &lt;em&gt;most likely&lt;/em&gt;, having to say &lt;em&gt;most likely&lt;/em&gt;, to retain function of the original.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So when you compare the original tools—Tool Series A, right, the unpatched tools—what you’ll find is varying degrees of success in the top right. It varied by tool. But in some cases, barely anything being flagged as potentially hazardous. And so improvement is then in the next series—Series B, the patched version of tools—we have more flagged in that upper-right corner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;And we felt confident that we had a more AI-resilient screening solution across the companies, and, James, at this point, the whole team decided it was time to disclose the vulnerability as well as the patch details and pointers to where to go for the updated screening software and to communicate this to synthesis companies worldwide via the IGSC. This was probably July, I think, of 2024. What was that process like, and how did members respond?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;I think members were really grateful and excited. To present to that group, to say, hey, this activity (a) has gone on, (b) was successful, and (c) was kept close hold until we knew how to mitigate this, I think everyone was really gratified by that and comforted by the fact that now they had kind of off-the-shelf solutions that they could use to improve their resilience against any incoming heavily engineered protein designs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks, James.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that we all understand this particular effort to be important but a &lt;em&gt;piece&lt;/em&gt; of the biosecurity and AI problem. I’m just curious to … I’ll ask all three of you to just share some brief reflections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know, Bruce, you’ve been on … you’ve stayed on this, and we’ve—all of us on the original team—have other projects going on that are pushing on the frontiers ahead of where we were with this paper when we published it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let me start with Tessa in terms of, like, what new risks do you see emerging as AI accelerates and maybe couple that with thoughts about how do we proactively get ahead of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I think with the Paraphrase’s work, as Bruce explained so well, you know, I sometimes use the metaphor of the previous response that the IGSC had to do, the synthesis screening community, where it used to be you could look for similarities to DNA sequences, and then everyone started doing synthetic biology where they were doing codon optimization so that proteins could express more efficiently in different host organisms, and now all of a sudden, well, you’ve scrambled your DNA sequence and it doesn’t look very similar even though your protein sequence actually still looks, you know, very similar or often the same once it’s been translated from DNA to protein, and so that was a, you know, many, many in the industry were already screening both DNA and protein, but they had to start screening … &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; had to start screening protein sequences even just to do the similarity testing as these codon optimization tools became universal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I feel like we’re, kind of, in a similar transition phase with protein-design, protein-rephrasing, tools where, you know, these tools are still in many cases drawing from the natural distribution of proteins. You know, I think some of the work we saw in, you know, designing novel CRISPR enzymes, you go, OK, yeah, it is novel; it’s very unlike any &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; CRISPR enzyme. But if you do a massive multiple sequence alignment of every CRISPR enzyme that we know about, you’re like, OK, this fits in the distribution of those enzymes. And so, you know, I think we’re not … we’re having to do a more flexible form of screening, where we look for things that are kind of within distribution of natural proteins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I feel like broadly, all of the screening tools were able to respond by doing something like that. And I think … I still feel like the clock is ticking down on that and that as the AI tools get better at predicting function and designing, sort of, novel sequences to pursue a particular function, you know—you have tools now that can go from Gene Ontology terms to a potential structure or potential sequence that may again be much farther out of the distribution of natural protein—I think all of us on the screening side are going to have to be responding to that, as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I think I see this as a necessary ongoing engagement between people at the frontier of designing novel biology and people at the frontier of producing all of the materials that allow that novel biology to be tested in the lab. You know, I think this feels like the first, you know, detailed, comprehensive zero day disclosure and response. But I think that’s … I think we’re going to see more of those. And I think what I’m excited about doing at IBBIS is trying to encourage and set up more infrastructure so that you can, as an AI developer, disclose these new discoveries to the people who need to respond before the publication comes out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Thank you, Tessa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The, the … Bruce, I mean, you and I are working on all sorts of dimensions. You’re leading up some efforts at Microsoft, for example, on the foundation model front and so on, among other directions. We’ve talked about new kinds of embedding models that might go beyond sequence and structure. Can you talk a little bit about just a few of the directions that just paint the larger constellation of the kinds of things that we talk about when we put our worry hats on?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;I feel like that could have its own dedicated podcast, as well. There’s a lot … [LAUGHTER] there’s a lot to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. We want to make sure that we don’t tell the world that the whole problem is solved here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Right, right, right. I think Tessa said it really, really well in that most of what we’re doing right now, it’s a variant on a known theme. I have to know the structure that does something bad to be able to pass it in as context. I have to know some existing sequence that does something bad to pass it in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And obviously the goal is to move away from that in benign applications, where when I’m designing something, I often want to design it because nothing exists [LAUGHS] that already does it. So we are going to be heading to this space where we don’t know what this protein does. It’s kind of a circular problem, right, where we’re going to need to be able to predict what some obscure protein sequence does in order to be able to still do our screening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, the way that I think about this, I often think about it beyond just DNA synthesis screening. It’s one line of defense, and there needs to be many lines of defense that come into play here that go beyond just relying on this one roadblock. It’s a very powerful roadblock. It’s a very powerful barrier. But we need to be proactively thinking about how we broaden the scope of defenses. And there are lots of conversations that are ongoing. I won’t go into the details of them. Again, that would be its own podcast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But primarily my big push—and I think this is emerging consensus in the field, though I don’t want to speak for everybody—is it needs to … any interventions we have need to come more at the systems level and less at the model level, primarily because this is such dual-use technology. If it can be used for good biological design, it can be used for bad biological design. Biology has no sense of morality. There is no bad protein. It’s just &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; protein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we need to think about this differently than how we would maybe think about looking at the outputs of that image generator model that I spoke about earlier, where I can physically look at an image and say, don’t want my model producing that, do want my model producing that. I don’t have that luxury in this space. So it’s a totally different problem. It’s an evolving problem. Conversations are happening about it, but the work is very much not done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;And, James, I want to give you the same open question, but I’d like to apply what Bruce just said on system level and so on and in the spirit of the kind of things that you’re very much involved with internationally to also add to it, just get some comments on programs and policies that move beyond technical solutions for governance mechanisms—logging, auditing nucleic acid orders, transparency, various kinds—that might complement technical approaches like Paraphrase and their status today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I’m very gratified that Bruce said that we, the synthesis industry, should not be the sole bulwark against misuse. That is very comforting and correct.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so the US government published a guidance document in 2023 that essentially said you, the entire biotech supply chain, have a responsibility to make sure that you’re evaluating your customers. You should know your customer; you know that they’re legitimate. I think that’s an important practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Export controls are designed to minimize the movement of equipment and materials that can be used in support of these kinds of misuse activities. And then governments have really been quite active in trying to incentivize, you know, sort of what we would think of as positive behavior, so screening, for example, in DNA synthesis companies. The US government created a framework in 2024, and it’s under a rewrite now to basically say US research dollars will only go to companies who make nucleic acid who do these good things. And so that is using, kind of, the government-funding carrot to, kind of, continue to build these layers of defense against potential misuse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks. Now, discussing risk, especially when it involves AI and biosecurity, isn’t always easy. As we’ve all been suggesting, some worry about alarming the public or arming bad actors. Others advocate for openness as a principle of doing science with integrity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A phase of our work as we prepared our paper was giving serious thought to both the benefits and the risks of transparency about what it was that we were doing. Some experts encouraged full disclosure as important for enhancing the science of biosecurity. Other experts, &lt;em&gt;all experts&lt;/em&gt;, cautioned against what are called &lt;em&gt;information hazards&lt;/em&gt;, the risk of sharing the details to enable malevolent actions with our findings or our approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we faced a real question: how can we support open science while minimizing the risk of misuse? And we took all the input we got, even if it was contradictory, very seriously. We carefully deliberated about a good balance, and even &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;, once we chose our balance and submitted our manuscript to &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the peer reviewers came back and said they wanted some of the more sensitive details that we withheld with explanations as to why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So this provoked some thinking out of the box about a novel approach, and we came up with a perpetual gatekeeping strategy where requests for access to sensitive methods and data and even the software across different risk categories would be carefully reviewed by a committee and a process for access that would continue in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, we brought the proposal to Tessa and her team at IBBIS—this is a great nonprofit group; look at their mission—and we worked with Tessa and her colleagues to refine a workable solution that was accepted by &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine as a new approach to handling information hazards as first demonstrated by our paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, Tessa, thank you again for helping us to navigate such a complex challenge. Can you share your perspective on information hazards? And then walk us through how our proposed system ensures responsible data and software sharing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. And thanks, Eric.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s all of the long discussions we had among the group of people on this podcast and the other authors on the paper and many people we engaged, you know, technical experts, people in various governments, you know, we heard a lot of contradictory advice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I think it showed us that there isn’t a consensus right now on how to handle information hazards in biotechnology. You know, I think … I don’t want to overstate how much of a consensus there is in cybersecurity either. If you go to DEF CON, you’ll hear people about how they’ve been mistreated in their attempts to do responsible disclosure for pacemakers and whatnot. But I think we’re … we have even less of a consensus when it comes to handling biological information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, you have some people who say, oh, because the size of the consequences could be so catastrophic if someone, you know, releases an engineered flu or something, you know, we should just never share information about this. And then you have other people who say there’s no possibility of building defenses unless we share information about this. And we heard very strong voices with both of those perspectives in the process of conducting this study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I think what we landed on that I’m really excited about and really excited to get feedback on now that the paper is out, you know, if you go and compare our preprint, which came out in December of 2024, and this paper in October 2025, you’ll see a lot of information got added back in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I’m excited to see people’s reaction to that because even back in January 2025, talking with people who were signatories to the responsible biodesign commitments, they were really excited that this was such an empirically concrete paper because they’d maybe read a number of papers talking about biosecurity risks from AI that didn’t include a whole lot of data, you know, often, I think, because of concerns about information hazards. And they found the arguments in this paper are much more convincing because we are able to share data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the process we underwent that I felt good about was trying to really clearly articulate, when we talk about an information hazard, what are we worried about being done with this data? And if we put this data in public, completely open source, does it shift the risk at all? You know, I think doing that kind of marginal contribution comparison is really important because it also let us make more things available publicly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there were a few tiers of data that after a lot of discussion amongst the authors of the paper, we thought, OK, potentially someone who wanted to do harm, if they got access to this data, it might make it easier for them. Again, not necessarily saying it, you know, it opens the floodgates, but it might make it easier for them. And when we thought about that, we thought, OK, you know, giving all of those paraphrased protein sequences, maybe, maybe that, you know, compared to having to set up the whole pipeline with the open-source tools yourself, just giving you those protein sequences, maybe that makes your life a bit easier if you’re trying to do harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then we thought, OK, giving you those protein sequences plus whether or not they were successfully flagged, maybe that makes your life, you know, quite a bit easier. And then finally, we thought, OK, the code that we want to share with some people who might try to reproduce these results or might try to build new screening systems that are more robust, we want to share the code with them. But again, if you have that whole code pipeline just prepared for you, it might really help make your life easier if you’re trying to do harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so we, sort of, sorted the data into these three tiers and then went through a process actually very inspired by the existing customer screening processes in nucleic acid synthesis about how to determine, you know, we tried to take an approach not of what gets you in but what gets you out. You know, for the most part, we think it should be possible to access this data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, if you have an affiliation with a recognizable institution or some good explanation of why you don’t have one right now, you know, if you have a reason for accessing this data, it shouldn’t be too hard to meet those requirements, but we wanted to have some in place. And we wanted it to be possible to rule out some people from getting access to this data. And so we’ve tried to be extremely transparent about what those are. If you go through our data access process and for some reason you get rejected, you’ll get a list of, “Here’s the reasons we rejected you. If you don’t think that’s right, get back to us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I’m really excited to pilot this in part because I think, you know, we’re already in conversations with some other people handling potential bio-AI information hazard about doing a similar process for their data of, you know, tiering it, determining which gates to put in which tiers, but I really hope a number of people do get access through the process or if they try and they fail, they tell us why. Because I think as we move toward this world of potentially, you know, biology that is much easier to engineer, partly due to dual-use tools, you know, my dream is it’s, like, still hard to engineer harm with biology, even if it’s really easy to engineer biology. And I think these, kind of, new processes for managing access to things, this sort of like, you know, open but not completely public, I think those can be a big part of that layered defense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks, Tessa. So we’re getting close to closing, and I just thought I would ask each of you to just share some reflections on what we’ve learned, the process we’ve demonstrated, the tools, the policy work that we did, this idea of facing the dual-use dilemma with … even at the information hazard level, with sharing information versus withholding it. What do you think about how our whole end to end of the study, now reaching the two-year point, can help other fields facing dual-use dilemmas?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tessa, Bruce, James … James, have you ever thought about that? And we’ll go to Bruce and then Tessa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yeah, I think it was an excellent model. I would like to see a study like this repeated on a schedule, you know, every six months because from where I sit, you know, the tools that we used for this project are now two years old. And so capabilities have moved on. Is the picture the same in terms of defensive capability? And so using that model over time, I think, would be incredibly valuable. And then using the findings to chart, you know, how much should we be investing in alternative strategies for this kind of risk mitigation for AI tool … the &lt;em&gt;products&lt;/em&gt; of AI tools?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Bruce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yeah, I think I would extend on what James said. The anecdote I like to point out about this project is, kind of, our schedule. We found the vulnerability and it was patched within a week, two weeks, on all major synthesis screening platforms. We wrote the paper within a month. We expanded on the paper within two months, and then we spent a year and a half to nearly two years [LAUGHS] trying to figure out what goes into the paper; how do we release this information; you know, how do we do this responsibly?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And my hope is similar to what James said. We’ve made it easier for others to do this type of work. Not this exact work; it doesn’t have to necessarily do with proteins. But to do this type of work where you are dealing with potential hazards but there is also value in sharing and that hopefully that year and a half we spent figuring out how to appropriately share and what to share will not be a year and a half for other teams because these systems are in place or at least there is an example to follow up from. So that’s my takeaway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ:&lt;/strong&gt; Tessa, bring us home—&lt;em&gt;bring us home!&lt;/em&gt; [LAUGHS]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bring us home!&lt;/em&gt; Let’s do it faster next time. [LAUGHTER] Come talk to any of us if you’re dealing with this kind of stuff. You know, I think IBBIS, especially, we want to be a partner for building those layers of defense and, you know, having ripped out our hair as a collective over the past year and a half about the right process to follow here, I think we all really hope it’ll be faster next time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I think, you know, the other thing I would encourage is if you’re an AI developer, I would encourage you to think about how your tool can strengthen screening and strengthen recognition of threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know James and I have talked before about how, you know, our Google search alerts each week send us dozens of cool AI bio papers, and it’s more like once a year or maybe once every six months, if we’re lucky, that we get something that’s like applying AI bio to biosecurity. So, you know, if you’re interested in these threats, I think we’d love to see more work that’s directly applied to facing these threats using the most modern technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Well said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, Bruce, James, Tessa, thank you so much for joining me today and for representing the many collaborators, both coauthors and beyond, who made this project possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s been a true pleasure to work with you. I’m so excited about what we’ve accomplished, the processes and the models that we’re now sharing with the world. And I’m deeply grateful for the collective intelligence and dedication that really powered the effort from the very beginning. So thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind every emerging technology is a great idea propelling it forward. In the Microsoft Research Podcast series &lt;em&gt;Ideas&lt;/em&gt;, members of the research community at Microsoft discuss the beliefs that animate their research, the experiences and thinkers that inform it, and the positive human impact it targets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI has been described as a “dual use” technology: the capabilities that can be leveraged for good can also potentially be used to cause harm. In this episode, Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz and his guests—Bruce Wittmann, a senior applied scientist at Microsoft; Tessa Alexanian&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;, a technical lead at the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science (IBBIS);&amp;nbsp;and James Diggans&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;, a vice president at Twist Bioscience—explore this idea in the context of AI-powered protein design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Horvitz at the lead, Alexanian, Diggans, and Wittmann were part of a cross-sector team that demonstrated toxic protein candidates could be designed with help from AI—and that they could bypass the systems in place to defend against their creation. The project, known as the &lt;em&gt;Paraphrase Project&lt;/em&gt;, culminated in a cybersecurity-style response, a more robust protein screening system, and a modified approach to peer review with implications for how we think about and tackle AI risk more broadly. The work was recently published in &lt;em&gt;Science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[MUSIC]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ERIC HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;You’re&amp;nbsp;listening to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ideas&lt;/em&gt;, a Microsoft Research Podcast that dives deep into the world of technology research and the profound questions behind the code.&amp;nbsp;I’m&amp;nbsp;Eric Horvitz, Microsoft’s chief scientific officer, and in this series, we explore the technologies shaping our future and the&amp;nbsp;big ideas&amp;nbsp;that propel them forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[MUSIC FADES]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today,&amp;nbsp;I’m&amp;nbsp;excited to talk about the Paraphrase Project, an effort I co-led exploring how&amp;nbsp;advances in&amp;nbsp;AI tools&amp;nbsp;for protein design&amp;nbsp;might&amp;nbsp;impact&amp;nbsp;biosecurity. The results were reported in our recent paper,&amp;nbsp;“Strengthening nucleic acid biosecurity screening against generative protein design tools,”&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;published in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;on Oct. 2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joining me are&amp;nbsp;three&amp;nbsp;of the larger set of&amp;nbsp;coauthors on that paper:&amp;nbsp;Bruce Wittmann, senior applied scientist at Microsoft;&amp;nbsp;James&amp;nbsp;Diggans, vice president at Twist Bioscience and chair of the board for the International Gene Synthesis Consortium;&amp;nbsp;and Tessa Alexanian, technical lead at the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science, also known as &lt;em&gt;IBBIS&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



				&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class="show-more-show-less-toggleable-content" id="show-more-show-less-toggle-1"&gt;
					



&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s&amp;nbsp;rewind two years.&amp;nbsp;Almost to&amp;nbsp;the day, Bruce and I uncovered a vulnerability. While preparing a case study for a workshop on AI and biosecurity, we discovered that open-source AI protein design tools could be used to redesign toxic proteins in ways that could bypass biosecurity screening systems, systems set up to&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp;incoming orders of concern.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now in that work, we&amp;nbsp;created an AI pipeline from open-source tools that could&amp;nbsp;essentially “paraphrase” the amino acid sequences—reformulating&amp;nbsp;them while&amp;nbsp;working to&amp;nbsp;preserve&amp;nbsp;their structure and potentially their function.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These paraphrased sequences could evade the screening systems used by major DNA&amp;nbsp;synthesis companies, and these are the systems that scientists rely on to safely produce AI-designed proteins.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, experts in the field described this finding as the first “zero day” for AI and biosecurity.&amp;nbsp;And this&amp;nbsp;marked the beginning of a deep, two-year collaborative effort to investigate and address this challenge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the help of a&amp;nbsp;strong&amp;nbsp;cross-sector team—including James, Tessa, Bruce, and many others—we worked behind the scenes to build AI biosecurity&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;red-teaming approaches&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;probe for vulnerabilities, and to design practical fixes. These “patches,” akin to those in cybersecurity,&amp;nbsp;have now been shared with&amp;nbsp;organizations&amp;nbsp;globally to strengthen biosecurity screening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has been one of the most fascinating projects&amp;nbsp;I’ve&amp;nbsp;had the privilege to work on, for its technical complexity, its ethical and policy dimensions, and the remarkable collaboration across industry, government, and nonprofit sectors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project highlights that the&amp;nbsp;same AI tools capable of&amp;nbsp;incredible&amp;nbsp;good can also be misused, requiring us to be vigilant, thoughtful, and creative so we continue to get the most benefit out of AI tools while working to ensure&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;we avoid costly misuses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With that, let me officially welcome our guests.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bruce, James, Tessa, welcome to the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRUCE WITTMANN: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks, Eric.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMES DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks for having us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s been such a pleasure working closely with each of you, not only for your expertise but also for your deep commitment and passion about public health and global safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the technical side of things, I’d like to ask each of you, how did you get into this field? What inspired you to become biologists and then pursue the implications of advances in AI for biosecurity? Bruce?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Well, I’ve always liked building things. That’s where I would say I come from. You know, my hobbies when I’m not working on biology or AI things—as you know, Eric—is, like, building things around the house, right. Doing construction. That kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But my broader interests have always been biology, chemistry. So I originally got into organic chemistry. I found that was fascinating. From there, went to synthetic biology, particularly metabolic engineering, because that’s kind of like organic chemistry, but you’re wiring together different parts of an organism’s metabolism rather than different chemical reactions. And while I was working in that space, I, kind of, had the thought of there’s got to be an easier way to do this [LAUGHS] because it is really difficult to do any type of metabolic engineering. And that’s how I got into the AI space, trying to solve these very complicated biological problems, trying to build things that we don’t necessarily even understand using our understanding from data or &lt;em&gt;deriving&lt;/em&gt; understanding from data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, you know, that’s the roundabout way of how I got to where I am—the abstract way of how I got to where I am.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;And, Tessa, what motivated you to jump into this area and zoom into biology and biosciences and helping us to avoid &lt;em&gt;catastrophic&lt;/em&gt; outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I mean, probably the origin of me being really excited about biology is actually a book called &lt;em&gt;[The] Lives of [a] Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; by Lewis Thomas, which is an extremely beautiful book of essays that made me be like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, wow, life is just incredible&lt;/em&gt;. I think I read it when I was, you know, 12 or 13, and I was like, &lt;em&gt;Life is incredible. I want to work on this. This is the most beautiful science&lt;/em&gt;, right. And then I, in university, I was studying engineering, and I heard there was this engineering team for engineering biology—this iGEM&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; team—and I joined it, and I thought, &lt;em&gt;Oh, this is so cool. I really got to go work in this field of synthetic biology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then I also tried doing the wet lab biology, and I was like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, but I don’t like this part&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;I don’t actually, like, like babysitting microbes.&lt;/em&gt; [LAUGHTER] I think there’s a way … some people who are great wet lab biologists are made of really stern stuff. And they really enjoy figuring out how to redesign their negative controls so they can figure out whether it was contamination or whether it was, you know, temperature fluctuation. I’m not that, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so I ended up becoming a lab automation engineer because I could help the science happen, but I … but my responsibilities were the robots and the computers rather than the microbes, which I find a little bit intransigent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Right. I was thinking of those tough souls; they also used their mouths to do pipetting and so on of these contaminated fluids …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN: &lt;/strong&gt;Not anymore. &lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s true. [LAUGHTER]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;Not anymore. [LAUGHS]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN:&lt;/strong&gt; They used to be tougher. They used to be tougher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;James.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS:&lt;/strong&gt; So I did my undergrad in computer science and microbiology, mostly because at the time, I couldn’t pick which of the two I liked more. I liked them both. And by the time I graduated, I was lucky enough that I realized that the intersection of the two could be a thing. And so I did a PhD in computational biology, and then I worked for five years at the MITRE Corporation. It’s a nonprofit. I got the chance to work with the US biodefense community and just found an incredible group of people working to protect forces and the population at large from biological threats and just learned a ton about both biology and also dual-use risk. And then so when Twist called me and asked if I wanted to join Twist and set up their biosecurity program, I leapt at the chance and have done that for the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, thanks everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I believe that AI-powered protein design in particular is one of the most exciting frontiers of modern science. It holds promise for breakthroughs in medicine, public health, even material science. We’re already seeing it lead to new vaccines, novel therapeutics, and—on the scientific front—powerful insights into the machinery of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So there’s much more ahead, especially in how AI can help us promote wellness, longevity, and the prevention of disease. But before we get too far ahead, while some of our listeners work in bioscience, many may not have a good understanding of some of the foundations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, Bruce, can you just give us a high-level overview of proteins? What are they? Why are they important? How do they figure into human-designed applications?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure. Yeah. Fortunately, I used to TA a class on AI for protein design, so it’s right in my wheelhouse. [LAUGHS]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Perfect, perfect background. [LAUGHS]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;It’s perfect. Yeah. I got to go back to all of that. Yeah, so from the very basic level, proteins are the workhorses of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every chemical reaction that happens in our body—well, nearly every chemical reaction that happens in our body—most of the structure of our cells, you name it. Any life process, proteins are central to it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now proteins are encoded by what are known as … well, I shouldn’t say encoded. They are &lt;em&gt;constructed&lt;/em&gt; from what are called amino acids—there are 20 of them—and depending on the combination and order in which you string these amino acids together, you get a different protein sequence. So that’s what we mean when we say protein sequence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sequence of a protein then determines what shape that protein folds into in a cell, and that shape determines what the protein does. So we will often say sequence determines structure, which determines function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the challenge that we face in engineering proteins is just how many possibilities there are. For all practical purposes, it’s infinite. So we have 20 building blocks. There are on average around 300 amino acids in a protein. So that’s 20 to the power of 300 possible combinations. And a common reference point is that it’s estimated there are around 10 to the 80 particles in the observable universe. So beyond astronomical numbers of possible combinations that we could have, and the job of a protein engineer is to find that one or a few of the proteins within that space that do what we want it to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So when a human has an idea of, OK, here’s what I want a protein to do, we have various techniques of finding that desired protein, one of which is using artificial intelligence and trying to either sift through that milieu of potential proteins or, as we’ll talk about more in this podcast, physically generating them. So creating them in a way, sampling them out of some distribution of reasonable proteins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Great. So I wanted to throw it to James now to talk about how protein design goes from computer to reality—from in silico to test tubes. What role does Twist Bioscience&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; play in transforming digital protein designs into synthesized proteins? And maybe we can talk also about what safeguards are in place at your company and why do we need them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;So all of these proteins that Bruce has described are encoded in DNA. So the language that our cells use to kind of store the information about how to make these proteins is all encoded in DNA. And so if you as an engineer have designed a protein and you want to test it to see if it does what you think it does, the first step is to have the DNA that encodes that protein manufactured, and companies like Twist carry out that role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we are cognizant also, however, that these are what are called &lt;em&gt;dual-use technologies&lt;/em&gt;. So you can use DNA and proteins for an incredible variety of amazing applications. So drug development, agricultural improvements, bioindustrial manufacturing, all manner of incredible applications. But you could also potentially use those to cause harm so toxins or other, you know, sort of biological misuse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so the industry has since at least 2010 recognized that they have a responsibility to make sure that when we’re asked to make some sequence of DNA that we understand what that thing is encoding and who we’re giving it for. So we’re screening both the customer that’s coming to us and we’re screening the sequence that they’re requesting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so Twist has long invested in a very, sort of, complicated system for essentially reverse engineering the constructs that we’re asked to make so that we understand what they are. And then a system where we engage with our customers and make sure that they’re going to use those for legitimate purpose and responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;And how do the emergence of these new generative AI tools influence how you think about risk?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;A lot of the power of these AI tools is they allow us to make proteins or design proteins that have never existed before in nature to carry out functions that don’t exist in the natural world. That’s an extremely powerful capability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the existing defensive tools that we use at DNA synthesis companies generally rely on what’s called homology, similarity to known naturally occurring sequences, to determine whether something might pose risk. And so AI tools kind of break the link between those two things.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Now you also serve as chair of the International Gene Synthesis Consortium&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;. Can you tell us a little bit more about the IGSC, its mission, how it supports global biosecurity?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;Certainly. So the IGSC was founded in 2010[1] and right now has grown to more than 40 companies and organizations across 10 countries. And the IGSC is essentially a place where companies who might be diehard competitors in the market around nucleic acid synthesis come together and design and develop best practices around biosecurity screening to, kind of, support the shared interest we all have in making sure that these technologies are not subject to misuse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks, James. Now, Tessa, your organization, IBBIS&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; is focused—it’s a beautiful mission—on advancing science while minimizing &lt;em&gt;catastrophic&lt;/em&gt; risk, likelihood of &lt;em&gt;catastrophic&lt;/em&gt; risk. When we say catastrophic risk, what do we really mean, Tessa, in the context of biology and AI? And how is that … do you view that risk landscape as evolving as AI capabilities are growing?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the … to be honest, as a person who’s been in biosecurity for a while, I’ve been surprised by how much of the conversation about the risks from advances in artificial intelligence has centered on the risk of engineered biological weapons and engineered pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even recently, there was a new discussion on introducing redlines for AI that came up at the UN General Assembly. And the very first item they list in their list of risks, if I’m not mistaken, was engineered pandemics, which is exactly the sort of thing that people fear could be done, could be done with these biological AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, I think that when we talk about catastrophic risk, we talk about, you know, something that has an impact on a large percentage of humanity. And I think the reason that we think that biotechnologies pose a catastrophic risk is that we believe there, as we’ve seen with many historical pandemics, there’s a possibility for something to emerge or be created that is beyond our society’s ability to control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, there were a few countries in COVID that managed to more or less successfully do a zero-COVID policy, but that was not, that was not most countries. That was not any of the countries that I lived in. And, you know, we saw millions of people die. And I think we believe that with something like the 1918 influenza, which had a much higher case fatality rate, you could have far more people die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, why we think about this in the context of AI and where this connects to DNA synthesis is that, you know, there is a … these risks of both, sort of, public health risks, pandemic risks, and misuse risks—people deliberately trying to do harm with biology, as we’ve seen from the long history of biological weapons programs—you know, we think that those might be accelerated in a few different ways by AI technology, both the potential … and I say potential here because as everyone who has worked in a wet lab—which I think is everyone on this call—knows, engineering biology is really difficult. So there’s maybe a potential for it to become easier to develop biological technology for the purposes of doing harm, and there’s maybe also the potential to create novel threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so I think people talk about both of those, and people have been looking hard for possible safeguards. And I think one safeguard that exists in this biosecurity world that, for example, doesn’t exist as cleanly in the cybersecurity world is that none of these biological threats can do harm until they are realized in physical reality, until you actually produce the protein or produce the virus or the microorganism that could do harm. And so I think at this point of production, both in DNA synthesis and elsewhere, we have a chance to introduce safeguards that can have a really large impact on the amount of risk that we’re facing—as long as we develop those safeguards in a way that keeps pace with AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, thanks, Tessa. So, Bruce, our project began when I posed a challenge to you of the form: could current open-source AI tools be tasked with rewriting toxic protein sequences in a way that preserves their native structure, and might they evade today’s screening systems?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I was preparing for a global workshop on AI and biosecurity that I’d been organizing with Frances Arnold, David Baker, and Lynda Stuart, and I wanted a concrete case study to challenge attendees. And what we found was interesting and deeply concerning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to dive in with you, Bruce, on the technical side. Can you describe some about the generative pipeline and how it works and what you did to build what we might call an AI and biosecurity red-teaming pipeline for testing and securing biosecurity screening tools?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure. Yeah. I think the best place to start with this is really by analogy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An analogy I often use in this case is the type of image generation AI tools we’re all familiar with now where I can tell the AI model, “Hey, give me a cartoonish picture of a dog playing fetch.” And it’ll do that, and it’ll give us back something that is likely never been seen before, right. That exact image is new, but the theme is still there. The theme is this dog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s kind of the same technology that we’re using in this red-teaming pipeline. Only rather than using plain language, English, we’re passing in what we would call conditioning information that is relevant to a protein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So our AI models aren’t at the point yet where I can say, “Give me a protein that does &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.” That would be the dream. We’re a long way from that. But what instead we do is we pass in things that match that theme that we’re interested in. So rather than saying, “Hey, give me back the theme on a dog,” we pass in information that we know will cause or at least push this generative model to create a protein that has the characteristics that we want.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So in the case of that example you just mentioned, Eric, it would be the protein structure. Like I mentioned earlier, we usually say structure determines function. There’s obviously a lot of nuance to that, but we can, at a first approximation, say structure determines function. So if I ask an AI model, ”Hey, here’s this structure; give me a protein sequence that folds to this structure,” just like with that analogy with the dog, it’s going to give me something that matches that structure but that is likely still never been seen before. It’s going to be a new sequence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So you can imagine taking this one step further. In the red-teaming pipeline, what we would do is take a protein that should normally be captured by DNA synthesis screening—that &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be captured by DNA synthesis screening—find its structure, pass it through one of these models, and get variants on the theme of that structure so these new sequences, these synthetic homologs that you mentioned, &lt;em&gt;paraphrased&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;reformulated&lt;/em&gt;, whatever phrase we want to use to describe them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And they have a chance or a greater chance than &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; of maintaining the structure and so maintaining the function while being sufficiently different that they’re not detected by these tools anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So that’s the nuts and bolts of how the red-teaming pipeline comes together. We use more tools than just structure. I think structure is the easiest one to understand. But we have a suite of tools in there, each pass different conditioning information that causes the model to generate sequences that are paraphrased versions of potential proteins of concern.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;But to get down to brass tacks, what Bruce did for the framing study was … we took the toxic, well-known toxic protein ricin, as we described in a framing paper that’s actually part of the appendix now to the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; publication, and we generated through this pipeline, composed of open-source tools, thousands of AI-rewritten versions of ricin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And this brings us to the next step of our project, way back when, at the early … in the early days of this effort, where Twist Bioscience was one of the companies we approached with what must have seemed like an unusual question to your CEO, in fact, James: would you be open to testing whether current screening systems could detect thousands of AI-rewritten versions of ricin, a well-known toxic protein?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And your CEO quickly connected me with you, James. So, James, what were your first thoughts on hearing about this project, and how did you respond to our initial framing study?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;I think my first response was gratitude and excitement. So it was fantastic that Microsoft had really leaned forward on this set of ideas and had produced this dataset. But to have it, you know, show up on our doorstep in a very concrete way with a partner that was ready to, sort of, help us try and address that, I think was a really … a valuable opportunity. And so we really leapt at that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ:&lt;/strong&gt; And the results were that both for you and another company, major producer IDT [Integrated DNA Technologies], those thousands of variants flew through … flew under the radar of the biosecurity screening software as we covered in that framing paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, after our initial findings on this, we quietly shared the paper with a few trusted contacts, including some in government. Through my work with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, or OSTP, we connected up with biosecurity leads there, and it was an OSTP biosecurity lead who described our results as the first &lt;em&gt;zero day&lt;/em&gt; in AI and biosecurity. And now in cybersecurity, a zero day is a vulnerability unknown to defenders generally, meaning there’s no time to respond before it could be exploited should it be known.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that vein, we took a cybersecurity approach. We stood up a CERT—C-E-R-T—a &lt;em&gt;cybersecurity [computer] emergency response team&lt;/em&gt; approach used in responding to cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and we implemented this process to address what we saw as a vulnerability with AI-enabled challenges to biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one point down the line, it was so rewarding to hear you say, James, “I’m really glad Microsoft got here first.” I’m curious how you think about this kind of AI-enabled vulnerability compared to other ones, biosecurity threats, you’ve encountered, and I’d love to hear your perspective on how we handled the situation from the early discovery to the coordination and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I think in terms of comparison known threats, the challenge here is really there is no good basis on which we can just, sort of, say, &lt;em&gt;Oh, I’ll build a new tool to detect this concrete universe of things&lt;/em&gt;, right. This was more a pattern of I’m going to use tools—and I love the name “Paraphrase”; it’s a fantastic name—I can paraphrase anything that I would normally think of as biological … as &lt;em&gt;posing&lt;/em&gt; biological risk, and now that thing is harder to detect for existing tools. And so that really was a very eye-opening experience, and I think the practice of forming this CERT response, putting together a group of people who were well versed not just in the threat landscape but also in the defensive technologies, and then figuring out how to mitigate that risk and broaden that study, I think, was a really incredibly valuable response to the entire synthesis industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and, Bruce, can you describe a little bit about the process by which we expanded the effort beyond our initial framing study to more toxins and then to a larger challenge set and then the results that we pursued and achieved?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yeah, of course. So, you know, using machine learning lingo, you don’t want to &lt;em&gt;overfit&lt;/em&gt; to a single example. So early on with this, as part of the framing study, we were able to show or I should say James and coworkers across the screening field were able to show that this could be patched, right. We needed to just make some changes to the tools,&amp;nbsp;and we could at the very least detect ricin or reformulated versions of ricin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the next step of course was then, OK, how generalizable are these patches? Can they detect other reformulated sequences, as well? So we had to expand the set of proteins that we had reformulated. We couldn’t just do 10s of thousands of ricins. We had to do 10s of thousands of name your other potentially hazardous …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;I think we had 72, was it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;It was 72 in the end that we ended up at. I believe, James, it was you and maybe Jake, another one of the authors on the list … on the paper, who primarily put that list together …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;This is Jacob Beal … Jacob Beal at Raytheon BBN.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN: &lt;/strong&gt;I think James actually might be the better one to answer how this list was expanded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Initially the focus [was] on ricin as a toxin so that list expanded to 62 sort of commonly controlled toxins that are subject to an export control restriction or other concern. And then on top of that, we added 10 viral proteins. So we didn’t really just want to look at toxins. We also wanted to look at viral proteins, largely because those proteins tend to have multiple functions. They have highly constrained structures. And so if we could work in a toxin context, could Paraphrase also do the same for viral proteins, as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;And, Bruce, can you describe some about how we characterize the updates and the, we’ll say, the boost in capabilities of the patched screening tools?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt; So we had, like you said, Eric, 72 base proteins or template proteins. And for each of those, we had generated a few 100 to a couple thousand reformulated variants of them. The only way to really get any sense of validity of those sequences was to predict their structures. So we predicted protein structures for I think it was 70ish thousand protein structures in the end that we had to predict and score them using in silico metrics. So things like, how similar is this to that template, wild-type protein structure that we used as our conditioning information?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We put them on a big grid. So we have two axes. We have on the x-axis—and this is a figure in our paper—the quality of the prediction. It’s essentially a confidence metric: how realistic is this protein sequence? And on the other axis is, how similar is the predicted structure of this variant to the original? And ultimately, what we were wanting to see was the proteins that scored well in both of those metrics, so that showed up in the top right of that diagram, were caught primarily, because these are again the ones that are &lt;em&gt;most likely&lt;/em&gt;, having to say &lt;em&gt;most likely&lt;/em&gt;, to retain function of the original.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So when you compare the original tools—Tool Series A, right, the unpatched tools—what you’ll find is varying degrees of success in the top right. It varied by tool. But in some cases, barely anything being flagged as potentially hazardous. And so improvement is then in the next series—Series B, the patched version of tools—we have more flagged in that upper-right corner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;And we felt confident that we had a more AI-resilient screening solution across the companies, and, James, at this point, the whole team decided it was time to disclose the vulnerability as well as the patch details and pointers to where to go for the updated screening software and to communicate this to synthesis companies worldwide via the IGSC. This was probably July, I think, of 2024. What was that process like, and how did members respond?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;I think members were really grateful and excited. To present to that group, to say, hey, this activity (a) has gone on, (b) was successful, and (c) was kept close hold until we knew how to mitigate this, I think everyone was really gratified by that and comforted by the fact that now they had kind of off-the-shelf solutions that they could use to improve their resilience against any incoming heavily engineered protein designs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks, James.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that we all understand this particular effort to be important but a &lt;em&gt;piece&lt;/em&gt; of the biosecurity and AI problem. I’m just curious to … I’ll ask all three of you to just share some brief reflections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know, Bruce, you’ve been on … you’ve stayed on this, and we’ve—all of us on the original team—have other projects going on that are pushing on the frontiers ahead of where we were with this paper when we published it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let me start with Tessa in terms of, like, what new risks do you see emerging as AI accelerates and maybe couple that with thoughts about how do we proactively get ahead of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I think with the Paraphrase’s work, as Bruce explained so well, you know, I sometimes use the metaphor of the previous response that the IGSC had to do, the synthesis screening community, where it used to be you could look for similarities to DNA sequences, and then everyone started doing synthetic biology where they were doing codon optimization so that proteins could express more efficiently in different host organisms, and now all of a sudden, well, you’ve scrambled your DNA sequence and it doesn’t look very similar even though your protein sequence actually still looks, you know, very similar or often the same once it’s been translated from DNA to protein, and so that was a, you know, many, many in the industry were already screening both DNA and protein, but they had to start screening … &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; had to start screening protein sequences even just to do the similarity testing as these codon optimization tools became universal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I feel like we’re, kind of, in a similar transition phase with protein-design, protein-rephrasing, tools where, you know, these tools are still in many cases drawing from the natural distribution of proteins. You know, I think some of the work we saw in, you know, designing novel CRISPR enzymes, you go, OK, yeah, it is novel; it’s very unlike any &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; CRISPR enzyme. But if you do a massive multiple sequence alignment of every CRISPR enzyme that we know about, you’re like, OK, this fits in the distribution of those enzymes. And so, you know, I think we’re not … we’re having to do a more flexible form of screening, where we look for things that are kind of within distribution of natural proteins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I feel like broadly, all of the screening tools were able to respond by doing something like that. And I think … I still feel like the clock is ticking down on that and that as the AI tools get better at predicting function and designing, sort of, novel sequences to pursue a particular function, you know—you have tools now that can go from Gene Ontology terms to a potential structure or potential sequence that may again be much farther out of the distribution of natural protein—I think all of us on the screening side are going to have to be responding to that, as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I think I see this as a necessary ongoing engagement between people at the frontier of designing novel biology and people at the frontier of producing all of the materials that allow that novel biology to be tested in the lab. You know, I think this feels like the first, you know, detailed, comprehensive zero day disclosure and response. But I think that’s … I think we’re going to see more of those. And I think what I’m excited about doing at IBBIS is trying to encourage and set up more infrastructure so that you can, as an AI developer, disclose these new discoveries to the people who need to respond before the publication comes out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Thank you, Tessa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The, the … Bruce, I mean, you and I are working on all sorts of dimensions. You’re leading up some efforts at Microsoft, for example, on the foundation model front and so on, among other directions. We’ve talked about new kinds of embedding models that might go beyond sequence and structure. Can you talk a little bit about just a few of the directions that just paint the larger constellation of the kinds of things that we talk about when we put our worry hats on?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;I feel like that could have its own dedicated podcast, as well. There’s a lot … [LAUGHTER] there’s a lot to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. We want to make sure that we don’t tell the world that the whole problem is solved here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Right, right, right. I think Tessa said it really, really well in that most of what we’re doing right now, it’s a variant on a known theme. I have to know the structure that does something bad to be able to pass it in as context. I have to know some existing sequence that does something bad to pass it in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And obviously the goal is to move away from that in benign applications, where when I’m designing something, I often want to design it because nothing exists [LAUGHS] that already does it. So we are going to be heading to this space where we don’t know what this protein does. It’s kind of a circular problem, right, where we’re going to need to be able to predict what some obscure protein sequence does in order to be able to still do our screening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, the way that I think about this, I often think about it beyond just DNA synthesis screening. It’s one line of defense, and there needs to be many lines of defense that come into play here that go beyond just relying on this one roadblock. It’s a very powerful roadblock. It’s a very powerful barrier. But we need to be proactively thinking about how we broaden the scope of defenses. And there are lots of conversations that are ongoing. I won’t go into the details of them. Again, that would be its own podcast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But primarily my big push—and I think this is emerging consensus in the field, though I don’t want to speak for everybody—is it needs to … any interventions we have need to come more at the systems level and less at the model level, primarily because this is such dual-use technology. If it can be used for good biological design, it can be used for bad biological design. Biology has no sense of morality. There is no bad protein. It’s just &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; protein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we need to think about this differently than how we would maybe think about looking at the outputs of that image generator model that I spoke about earlier, where I can physically look at an image and say, don’t want my model producing that, do want my model producing that. I don’t have that luxury in this space. So it’s a totally different problem. It’s an evolving problem. Conversations are happening about it, but the work is very much not done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;And, James, I want to give you the same open question, but I’d like to apply what Bruce just said on system level and so on and in the spirit of the kind of things that you’re very much involved with internationally to also add to it, just get some comments on programs and policies that move beyond technical solutions for governance mechanisms—logging, auditing nucleic acid orders, transparency, various kinds—that might complement technical approaches like Paraphrase and their status today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I’m very gratified that Bruce said that we, the synthesis industry, should not be the sole bulwark against misuse. That is very comforting and correct.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so the US government published a guidance document in 2023 that essentially said you, the entire biotech supply chain, have a responsibility to make sure that you’re evaluating your customers. You should know your customer; you know that they’re legitimate. I think that’s an important practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Export controls are designed to minimize the movement of equipment and materials that can be used in support of these kinds of misuse activities. And then governments have really been quite active in trying to incentivize, you know, sort of what we would think of as positive behavior, so screening, for example, in DNA synthesis companies. The US government created a framework in 2024, and it’s under a rewrite now to basically say US research dollars will only go to companies who make nucleic acid who do these good things. And so that is using, kind of, the government-funding carrot to, kind of, continue to build these layers of defense against potential misuse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks. Now, discussing risk, especially when it involves AI and biosecurity, isn’t always easy. As we’ve all been suggesting, some worry about alarming the public or arming bad actors. Others advocate for openness as a principle of doing science with integrity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A phase of our work as we prepared our paper was giving serious thought to both the benefits and the risks of transparency about what it was that we were doing. Some experts encouraged full disclosure as important for enhancing the science of biosecurity. Other experts, &lt;em&gt;all experts&lt;/em&gt;, cautioned against what are called &lt;em&gt;information hazards&lt;/em&gt;, the risk of sharing the details to enable malevolent actions with our findings or our approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we faced a real question: how can we support open science while minimizing the risk of misuse? And we took all the input we got, even if it was contradictory, very seriously. We carefully deliberated about a good balance, and even &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;, once we chose our balance and submitted our manuscript to &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the peer reviewers came back and said they wanted some of the more sensitive details that we withheld with explanations as to why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So this provoked some thinking out of the box about a novel approach, and we came up with a perpetual gatekeeping strategy where requests for access to sensitive methods and data and even the software across different risk categories would be carefully reviewed by a committee and a process for access that would continue in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, we brought the proposal to Tessa and her team at IBBIS—this is a great nonprofit group; look at their mission—and we worked with Tessa and her colleagues to refine a workable solution that was accepted by &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine as a new approach to handling information hazards as first demonstrated by our paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, Tessa, thank you again for helping us to navigate such a complex challenge. Can you share your perspective on information hazards? And then walk us through how our proposed system ensures responsible data and software sharing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. And thanks, Eric.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s all of the long discussions we had among the group of people on this podcast and the other authors on the paper and many people we engaged, you know, technical experts, people in various governments, you know, we heard a lot of contradictory advice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I think it showed us that there isn’t a consensus right now on how to handle information hazards in biotechnology. You know, I think … I don’t want to overstate how much of a consensus there is in cybersecurity either. If you go to DEF CON, you’ll hear people about how they’ve been mistreated in their attempts to do responsible disclosure for pacemakers and whatnot. But I think we’re … we have even less of a consensus when it comes to handling biological information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, you have some people who say, oh, because the size of the consequences could be so catastrophic if someone, you know, releases an engineered flu or something, you know, we should just never share information about this. And then you have other people who say there’s no possibility of building defenses unless we share information about this. And we heard very strong voices with both of those perspectives in the process of conducting this study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I think what we landed on that I’m really excited about and really excited to get feedback on now that the paper is out, you know, if you go and compare our preprint, which came out in December of 2024, and this paper in October 2025, you’ll see a lot of information got added back in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I’m excited to see people’s reaction to that because even back in January 2025, talking with people who were signatories to the responsible biodesign commitments, they were really excited that this was such an empirically concrete paper because they’d maybe read a number of papers talking about biosecurity risks from AI that didn’t include a whole lot of data, you know, often, I think, because of concerns about information hazards. And they found the arguments in this paper are much more convincing because we are able to share data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the process we underwent that I felt good about was trying to really clearly articulate, when we talk about an information hazard, what are we worried about being done with this data? And if we put this data in public, completely open source, does it shift the risk at all? You know, I think doing that kind of marginal contribution comparison is really important because it also let us make more things available publicly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there were a few tiers of data that after a lot of discussion amongst the authors of the paper, we thought, OK, potentially someone who wanted to do harm, if they got access to this data, it might make it easier for them. Again, not necessarily saying it, you know, it opens the floodgates, but it might make it easier for them. And when we thought about that, we thought, OK, you know, giving all of those paraphrased protein sequences, maybe, maybe that, you know, compared to having to set up the whole pipeline with the open-source tools yourself, just giving you those protein sequences, maybe that makes your life a bit easier if you’re trying to do harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then we thought, OK, giving you those protein sequences plus whether or not they were successfully flagged, maybe that makes your life, you know, quite a bit easier. And then finally, we thought, OK, the code that we want to share with some people who might try to reproduce these results or might try to build new screening systems that are more robust, we want to share the code with them. But again, if you have that whole code pipeline just prepared for you, it might really help make your life easier if you’re trying to do harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so we, sort of, sorted the data into these three tiers and then went through a process actually very inspired by the existing customer screening processes in nucleic acid synthesis about how to determine, you know, we tried to take an approach not of what gets you in but what gets you out. You know, for the most part, we think it should be possible to access this data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, if you have an affiliation with a recognizable institution or some good explanation of why you don’t have one right now, you know, if you have a reason for accessing this data, it shouldn’t be too hard to meet those requirements, but we wanted to have some in place. And we wanted it to be possible to rule out some people from getting access to this data. And so we’ve tried to be extremely transparent about what those are. If you go through our data access process and for some reason you get rejected, you’ll get a list of, “Here’s the reasons we rejected you. If you don’t think that’s right, get back to us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I’m really excited to pilot this in part because I think, you know, we’re already in conversations with some other people handling potential bio-AI information hazard about doing a similar process for their data of, you know, tiering it, determining which gates to put in which tiers, but I really hope a number of people do get access through the process or if they try and they fail, they tell us why. Because I think as we move toward this world of potentially, you know, biology that is much easier to engineer, partly due to dual-use tools, you know, my dream is it’s, like, still hard to engineer harm with biology, even if it’s really easy to engineer biology. And I think these, kind of, new processes for managing access to things, this sort of like, you know, open but not completely public, I think those can be a big part of that layered defense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks, Tessa. So we’re getting close to closing, and I just thought I would ask each of you to just share some reflections on what we’ve learned, the process we’ve demonstrated, the tools, the policy work that we did, this idea of facing the dual-use dilemma with … even at the information hazard level, with sharing information versus withholding it. What do you think about how our whole end to end of the study, now reaching the two-year point, can help other fields facing dual-use dilemmas?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tessa, Bruce, James … James, have you ever thought about that? And we’ll go to Bruce and then Tessa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGGANS:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yeah, I think it was an excellent model. I would like to see a study like this repeated on a schedule, you know, every six months because from where I sit, you know, the tools that we used for this project are now two years old. And so capabilities have moved on. Is the picture the same in terms of defensive capability? And so using that model over time, I think, would be incredibly valuable. And then using the findings to chart, you know, how much should we be investing in alternative strategies for this kind of risk mitigation for AI tool … the &lt;em&gt;products&lt;/em&gt; of AI tools?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Bruce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITTMANN:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yeah, I think I would extend on what James said. The anecdote I like to point out about this project is, kind of, our schedule. We found the vulnerability and it was patched within a week, two weeks, on all major synthesis screening platforms. We wrote the paper within a month. We expanded on the paper within two months, and then we spent a year and a half to nearly two years [LAUGHS] trying to figure out what goes into the paper; how do we release this information; you know, how do we do this responsibly?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And my hope is similar to what James said. We’ve made it easier for others to do this type of work. Not this exact work; it doesn’t have to necessarily do with proteins. But to do this type of work where you are dealing with potential hazards but there is also value in sharing and that hopefully that year and a half we spent figuring out how to appropriately share and what to share will not be a year and a half for other teams because these systems are in place or at least there is an example to follow up from. So that’s my takeaway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ:&lt;/strong&gt; Tessa, bring us home—&lt;em&gt;bring us home!&lt;/em&gt; [LAUGHS]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXANIAN: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bring us home!&lt;/em&gt; Let’s do it faster next time. [LAUGHTER] Come talk to any of us if you’re dealing with this kind of stuff. You know, I think IBBIS, especially, we want to be a partner for building those layers of defense and, you know, having ripped out our hair as a collective over the past year and a half about the right process to follow here, I think we all really hope it’ll be faster next time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I think, you know, the other thing I would encourage is if you’re an AI developer, I would encourage you to think about how your tool can strengthen screening and strengthen recognition of threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know James and I have talked before about how, you know, our Google search alerts each week send us dozens of cool AI bio papers, and it’s more like once a year or maybe once every six months, if we’re lucky, that we get something that’s like applying AI bio to biosecurity. So, you know, if you’re interested in these threats, I think we’d love to see more work that’s directly applied to facing these threats using the most modern technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORVITZ: &lt;/strong&gt;Well said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, Bruce, James, Tessa, thank you so much for joining me today and for representing the many collaborators, both coauthors and beyond, who made this project possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s been a true pleasure to work with you. I’m so excited about what we’ve accomplished, the processes and the models that we’re now sharing with the world. And I’m deeply grateful for the collective intelligence and dedication that really powered the effort from the very beginning. So thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Monday, AMD announced it will supply AI chips to OpenAI in a multi-year deal worth tens of billions of dollars annually that gives the ChatGPT creator an option to acquire up to 10 percent of the chipmaker's stock for 1 cent per share, Reuters reports. The agreement covers hundreds of thousands of AMD's AI graphics processing units over several years starting in the second half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal marks a major endorsement of AMD's AI hardware and software capabilities as the company competes with Nvidia for dominance in the AI chip market. AMD executives project the agreement will generate more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers who follow OpenAI's lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry," AMD Executive Vice President Forrest Norrod told Reuters on Sunday. The chipmaker will start booking income from the deal next year when OpenAI starts building a 1 gigawatt facility based on AMD's forthcoming MI450 series chips.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;As part of the arrangement, AMD will allow OpenAI to purchase up to 160 million AMD shares at 1 cent each throughout the chips deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI diversifies its chip supply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With demand for AI compute growing rapidly, companies like OpenAI have been looking for secondary supply lines and sources of additional computing capacity, and the AMD partnership is part the company's wider effort to secure sufficient computing power for its AI operations. In September, Nvidia announced an investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI that included supplying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems. OpenAI plans to deploy a gigawatt of Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin chips in late 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has worked with AMD for years, according to Reuters, providing input on the design of older generations of AI chips such as the MI300X. The new agreement calls for deploying the equivalent of 6 gigawatts of computing power using AMD chips over multiple years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond working with chip suppliers, OpenAI is widely reported to be developing its own silicon for AI applications and has partnered with Broadcom, as we reported in February. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters the AMD deal does not change OpenAI's ongoing compute plans, including its chip development effort or its partnership with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adobe Analytics develops its predictions by analyzing over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, encompassing 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories. Its analytics software is used by a majority of the U.S.’s top 100 online retailers, giving it deep insights into online shopping and consumer behavior.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company forecasts that Cyber Monday will again be the biggest shopping day of the year, up 6.3% year-over-year to reach $14.2 billion. Black Friday will also see higher growth, up 8.3% year-over-year to hit $11.7 billion. U.S. consumers on Thanksgiving Day are also expected to spend $6.4 billion online, up 4.9% year-over-year, as online sales start early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Driving the sales this holiday season will be consumer demand for discounts, where products are expected to be 28% off listed prices. Other trends like shopping from mobile devices, the use of AI services to shop, buy now, pay later services, are other factors behind the rise in online sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, Adobe predicts that generative AI-powered shopping will boom this year, with AI traffic set to rise by 520% year-over-year and peaking in the 10 days leading up to Thanksgiving. This follows the 1,300% increase in AI traffic to U.S. retail sites seen in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company expects consumers to largely use AI for research ahead of purchases, based on a survey of 5,000 U.S. consumers — 53% of whom said they may use AI services for this purpose. The survey also found that 40% said they would use AI for recommendations, 36% for deal finding, and 30% for gift inspiration. Adobe expects AI to be used most across categories like toys, electronics, jewelry, and personal care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another trend expected this year involves mobile devices once again driving more online spend compared with desktop shopping, reaching a record 56.1% share. Last year, mobile accounted for 54.5% of the online transactions during this period, up from 51.1% in 2023. It’s unclear when the mobile growth will taper off and stabilize, especially given the larger-screened smartphone devices available on the market, which make it easier to shop online.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 2025 holiday shopping will also see further growth of buy now, pay later (BNPL) services, which are expected to drive $20.2 billion in online spend, up 11% year-over-year, and around $2 billion more than the 2024 holiday season. Cyber Monday is also expected to see a new BNPL milestone, when online spend in this category is expected to reach $1.04 billion, up 5% year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Social media will also drive more online sales this year. Social media advertising expected to drive a 51% year-over-year increase in online revenue, up from 5% year-over-year growth in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Top categories for spending overall include electronics ($57.5 billion, up 4% YoY), apparel ($47.6 billion, up 4.4% YoY), and furniture ($31.1 billion, up 6.5% YoY). &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JPM-hero-GettyImages-1492413753.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The U.S. holiday shopping season is expected to bring in $253.4 billion in online sales this year, up 5.3% year-over-year, according to a new report from Adobe’s e-commerce connected division, Adobe Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adobe Analytics develops its predictions by analyzing over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, encompassing 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories. Its analytics software is used by a majority of the U.S.’s top 100 online retailers, giving it deep insights into online shopping and consumer behavior.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company forecasts that Cyber Monday will again be the biggest shopping day of the year, up 6.3% year-over-year to reach $14.2 billion. Black Friday will also see higher growth, up 8.3% year-over-year to hit $11.7 billion. U.S. consumers on Thanksgiving Day are also expected to spend $6.4 billion online, up 4.9% year-over-year, as online sales start early.&lt;/p&gt;

However, researchers have suggested new ways to increase long-term memory of AI models, as they often can’t hold context over several sessions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;19-year-old founder Dhravya Shah is attempting to solve problems in this area by building a memory solution, called Supermemory, for AI apps. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Originally from Mumbai in India, Shah started building consumer-facing bots and apps a few years ago. He even sold his bot that formatted tweets into good-looking screenshots to the social media tool Hypefury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The founder, who was preparing for an entrance exam to get into IIT(Indian Institute of Technology), earned good money from this sale and decided to move to the U.S to attend Arizona State University instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After relocating, he challenged himself to build something new each week for 40 weeks. During one of those weeks, he built Supermemory (which was initially called Any Context) and put it on GitHub. At that time, the tool allowed you to chat with your Twitter bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The current version of the tool extracts “memories” or insights from unstructured data and helps the applications understand the context better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3054464" height="395" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Memory-map-Supermemory.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A memory map extracted by Supermemory Image Credits: Supermemory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shah secured an internship at Cloudflare in 2024, where he worked on AI and infrastructure. He later worked as a developer relations lead at the company. During this time, advisors, including Cloudflare CTO Dane Knecht, asked him to turn Supermemory into a product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This year, he decided to build Supermemory full-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Supermemory, now described as a universal memory API for AI apps, builds a knowledge graph based on the data it processes and personalizes the context for the users. For instance, it can support querying across month-old entries for a writing or a journaling app, or searching for an email app. As the solution allows for multimodal inputs, it could also allow a video editor to fetch relevant assets from a library for a particular prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup can ingest any type of data, the company says, including files, docs, chats, projects, emails, PDFs, and app data streams. Its chatbot and notetaker feature lets users add memories in text, add files or links, and connect to apps like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Notion. There’s also a Chrome extension that lets you easily add notes from a website.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our core strength is to extract insights from any kind of unstructured data and give the apps more context about users. As we work across multimodal data, our solution is suitable for all kinds of AI apps ranging from email clients to video editors,” Shah said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Supermemory has secured seed funding of $2.6 million led by Susa Ventures, Browder Capital, and SF1.vc. The round also includes individual investors like Cloudflare’s Knecht, Google AI chief Jeff Dean, Deepmind product manager Logan Kilpatrick, Sentry founder David Cramer, and executives from OpenAI, Meta, and Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shah said at one point, Y-Combinator also approached him to join one of its batches, but he already had investors on board, so the timing didn’t work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3054468" height="410" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/50a44eb1-cf53-4256-a05f-e6d3b6919644-spark-clipboard.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Supermemory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Joshua Browder, founder and CEO of “Robot lawyer” startup DoNotPay, who runs Browder Capital as a solo GP, was impressed by Shah’s tenacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I connected with Dhravya over X, and what struck me was how quickly he moves and builds things, and that prompted me to invest in him,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has multiple existing customers, including a16z-backed desktop assistant Cluely, AI video editor Montra, AI search Scira, Composio’s multi-MCP tool Rube, and Real estate startup Rets. Plus, it’s working with a robotics company to retain visual memories captured by a robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While this is a slant towards consumers, the app feels more like a playground for developers to understand more about the tool and potentially use it in their workflows or their own apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Supermemory has substantial competitors in the memory space. Startups like Felicis Ventures-backed Letta and Mem0 (where Shah worked for a short while) are building a memory layer for agents. Supermemory’s own backer, Susa Ventures, has invested in Memories.ai along with Samsung, which can tap into thousands of hours of footage to get insights. Shah says that while these startups might serve different industries and use cases, Supermemory will stand out because it offers lower latency.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“More and more AI companies will need a memory layer. Supermemory’s solution provides high performance while allowing you to surface relevant context quickly.” Browder said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Context windows of AI models, which indicate the ability of a model to “remember” information, have increased over time.

The company says more than 1,500 people are scheduled to convene at Fort Mason in San Francisco for OpenAI’s “biggest event yet,” which features announcements, keynotes from OpenAI executives, and a fireside chat between CEO Sam Altman and longtime Apple designer Jony Ive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;From the sound of it, DevDay 2025 is shaping up to be a grand display of OpenAI’s rising dominance in Silicon Valley against giants like Apple, Google, and Meta. OpenAI is currently building an AI device, a social media app, and an AI-powered browser to take on Chrome. In other words, OpenAI has a lot more going on than it did during its first DevDay in 2023, when it mostly just had ChatGPT and an API business for developers to access its models.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, OpenAI faces more competition than ever in the bid to win over developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the last year, Anthropic’s and Google’s AI models have become increasingly capable for coding tasks and web design. OpenAI has been forced to release better AI models at lower prices to remain in the race. In the background, Meta has built up an impressive roster of AI talent in its new group, Meta Superintelligence Labs, which could become another threat to OpenAI in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled at its first DevDay in 2023 a new AI model, GPT-4 Turbo, and Altman shared his vision for a marketplace of AI agents called the GPT Store. Altman was ousted as CEO days later — only to return after a dramatic weekend of negotiations. In 2024, OpenAI responded with a more subdued conference, announcing some meaningful developer upgrades, such as an API for AI voice applications, but not much else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nothing is confirmed to launch at DevDay 2025, stoking plenty of rumors. Perhaps OpenAI will finally unveil the AI-powered browser it’s been working on, or maybe give an update on the AI device it’s building with Ive and former Apple executives. It’s also possible there could be some updates related to the GPT Store, or a new offering that lets developers build agentic workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch will be on the ground in San Francisco covering the event live, so you can check back here for all the news. Here’s what you need to know about OpenAI’s DevDay, and how to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DevDay 2025 kicks off at 10 a.m. PT October 6 with an opening keynote from Altman, in which he’s scheduled to unveil “announcements, live demos, and a vision of how developers are reshaping the future with AI.” The keynote will last roughly one hour and will be livestreamed on OpenAI’s YouTube page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s the only event that will be livestreamed for remote attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For in-person attendees, there will be onstage presentations and talks from Cursor CEO Michael Truell, San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, and Andreessen Horowitz investing partner Kimberly Tan, among others. Several OpenAI employees will also give speeches about their work, including model behavior researcher Laurentia Romaniuk and Codex lead Alexander Embiricos.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s also supposed to be a series of AI-powered sideshows at DevDay 2025. One of them is “Sora Cinema,” which is described as a “cozy mini-theater with popcorn” featuring short films generated by OpenAI’s video model, Sora. There’s also supposed to be a phone booth with a “living portrait” of the famed computer scientist Alan Turing “that speaks back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Later in the afternoon, there will be two big events to cap off DevDay. These last two events won’t be livestreamed, but they will be posted on YouTube later that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At 3:15 p.m. PT, there will be a “Developer State of the Union” with OpenAI president Greg Brockman and Olivier Godement, who heads up product for the OpenAI Platform. The two OpenAI executives are slated to “demo new capabilities” and share what’s ahead for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, at 4:15 p.m. PT, Altman and Ive will give a “Closing Fireside Chat” to discuss the “craft of building in the age of AI.” That conversation will last about 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the last year, Anthropic’s and Google’s AI models have become increasingly capable for coding tasks and web design. OpenAI has been forced to release better AI models at lower prices to remain in the race. In the background, Meta has built up an impressive roster of AI talent in its new group, Meta Superintelligence Labs, which could become another threat to OpenAI in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled at its first DevDay in 2023 a new AI model, GPT-4 Turbo, and Altman shared his vision for a marketplace of AI agents called the GPT Store. Altman was ousted as CEO days later — only to return after a dramatic weekend of negotiations. In 2024, OpenAI responded with a more subdued conference, announcing some meaningful developer upgrades, such as an API for AI voice applications, but not much else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nothing is confirmed to launch at DevDay 2025, stoking plenty of rumors. Perhaps OpenAI will finally unveil the AI-powered browser it’s been working on, or maybe give an update on the AI device it’s building with Ive and former Apple executives. It’s also possible there could be some updates related to the GPT Store, or a new offering that lets developers build agentic workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch will be on the ground in San Francisco covering the event live, so you can check back here for all the news. Here’s what you need to know about OpenAI’s DevDay, and how to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DevDay 2025 kicks off at 10 a.m. PT October 6 with an opening keynote from Altman, in which he’s scheduled to unveil “announcements, live demos, and a vision of how developers are reshaping the future with AI.” The keynote will last roughly one hour and will be livestreamed on OpenAI’s YouTube page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s the only event that will be livestreamed for remote attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For in-person attendees, there will be onstage presentations and talks from Cursor CEO Michael Truell, San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, and Andreessen Horowitz investing partner Kimberly Tan, among others. Several OpenAI employees will also give speeches about their work, including model behavior researcher Laurentia Romaniuk and Codex lead Alexander Embiricos.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s also supposed to be a series of AI-powered sideshows at DevDay 2025. One of them is “Sora Cinema,” which is described as a “cozy mini-theater with popcorn” featuring short films generated by OpenAI’s video model, Sora. There’s also supposed to be a phone booth with a “living portrait” of the famed computer scientist Alan Turing “that speaks back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Later in the afternoon, there will be two big events to cap off DevDay. These last two events won’t be livestreamed, but they will be posted on YouTube later that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At 3:15 p.m. PT, there will be a “Developer State of the Union” with OpenAI president Greg Brockman and Olivier Godement, who heads up product for the OpenAI Platform. The two OpenAI executives are slated to “demo new capabilities” and share what’s ahead for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, at 4:15 p.m. PT, Altman and Ive will give a “Closing Fireside Chat” to discuss the “craft of building in the age of AI.” That conversation will last about 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The Australian Financial Review reports that Deloitte Australia will offer the Australian government a partial refund for a report that was littered with AI-hallucinated quotes and references to nonexistent research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte's "Targeted Compliance Framework Assurance Review" was finalized in July and published by Australia's Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) in August (Internet Archive version of the original). The report, which cost Australian taxpayers nearly $440,000 AUD (about $290,000 USD), focuses on the technical framework the government uses to automate penalties under the country's welfare system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the report was published, though, Sydney University Deputy Director of Health Law Chris Rudge noticed citations to multiple papers and publications that did not exist. That included multiple references to nonexistent reports by Lisa Burton Crawford, a real professor at the University of Sydney law school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is concerning to see research attributed to me in this way," Crawford told the AFR in August. "I would like to see an explanation from Deloitte as to how the citations were generated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“A small number of corrections”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte and the DEWR buried that explanation in an updated version of the original report published Friday "to address a small number of corrections to references and footnotes," according to the DEWR website. On page 58 of that 273-page updated report, Deloitte added a reference to "a generative AI large language model (Azure OpenAI GPT-4o) based tool chain" that was used as part of the technical workstream to help "[assess] whether system code state can be mapped to business requirements and compliance needs."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;

    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Of the 141 sources cited in an extensive "Reference List" in the original report, only 127 appear in the updated report. In addition to the now-deleted references to fake publications from Crawford and other academics, the updated report also removed a fabricated quote attributed to an actual ruling from federal justice Jennifer Davies (spelled as "Davis" in the original report).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte Australia said it will repay the final installment of its contract with the government, though it's unclear which portion of the total contract that represents. A spokesperson for DEWR told the AFR that "the substance of the independent review is retained, and there are no changes to the recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Sydney University's Rudge told AFR that "you cannot trust the recommendations when the very foundation of the report is built on a flawed, originally undisclosed, and non-expert methodology... Deloitte has admitted to using generative AI for a core analytical task; but it failed to disclose this in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;

            Earlier this year, Deloitte declared it would start using generative AI for its reports as a way of enhancing the value provided to its clients. I don't remember if they said it in a specific report or not, but I recall seeing it. &lt;p&gt;The citation issue continues to trip people up across the spectrum, from lawyers to business analysts. It's striking how many supposedly smart people do not understand the limits of the tools they insist will deliver such amazing value.

            Earlier this year, Deloitte declared it would start using generative AI for its reports as a way of enhancing the value provided to its clients. I don't remember if they said it in a specific report or not, but I recall seeing it. &lt;p&gt;The citation issue continues to trip people up across the spectrum, from lawyers to business analysts. It's striking how many supposedly smart people do not understand the limits of the tools they insist will deliver such amazing value.
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Llama is&amp;nbsp;somewhat unique&amp;nbsp;among major models in that&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;“open,” meaning developers can download and use it however they please (with certain limitations).&amp;nbsp;That’s&amp;nbsp;in contrast to models like&amp;nbsp;Anthropic’s&amp;nbsp;Claude,&amp;nbsp;Google’s Gemini,&amp;nbsp;xAI’s&amp;nbsp;Grok, and most of OpenAI’s ChatGPT models,&amp;nbsp;which can only be accessed via APIs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the interest of giving developers choice, however, Meta has also partnered with vendors, including AWS, Google Cloud,&amp;nbsp;and Microsoft Azure, to make cloud-hosted versions of Llama available. In addition, the company&amp;nbsp;publishes tools, libraries, and recipes in its Llama cookbook to help developers fine-tune, evaluate, and adapt the models to their domain. With newer generations like&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Llama 3&amp;nbsp;and Llama 4, these capabilities have expanded to include native multimodal support and broader cloud rollouts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s&amp;nbsp;everything you need to know about&amp;nbsp;Meta’s&amp;nbsp;Llama, from its capabilities and editions to where you can use it.&amp;nbsp;We’ll&amp;nbsp;keep this post updated as Meta releases upgrades and introduces new dev tools to support the model’s use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-llama"&gt;What is Llama? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Llama is a family of models — not just one. The latest version is&amp;nbsp;Llama 4;&amp;nbsp;it was&amp;nbsp;released in April 2025&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;includes three models:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scout:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;17 billion active parameters, 109 billion total parameters, and a context window of 10 million tokens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maverick:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;17 billion active parameters, 400 billion total parameters, and a context window of 1 million tokens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behemoth&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Not yet released&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;have 288 billion active&amp;nbsp;parameters&amp;nbsp;and 2 trillion total parameters.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(In data science, tokens are subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables “fan,” “tas” and “tic” in the word “fantastic.”)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A model’s context, or context window, refers to input data (e.g., text) that the model considers before generating output (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;additional&amp;nbsp;text). Long context can prevent models from “forgetting” the content of recent docs and data, and from veering off topic and extrapolating wrongly. However, longer context windows can also&amp;nbsp;result in the model “forgetting” certain safety guardrails&amp;nbsp;and being more prone to produce content that is in line with the conversation, which has led&amp;nbsp;some users toward&amp;nbsp;delusional thinking.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For reference,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;10 million context window&amp;nbsp;that Llama 4 Scout promises&amp;nbsp;roughly equals&amp;nbsp;the text of about 80 average novels.&amp;nbsp;Llama 4&amp;nbsp;Maverick’s&amp;nbsp;1 million context window equals about eight novels.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the Llama 4 models&amp;nbsp;were trained on “large amounts of unlabeled text, image, and video data” to give them “broad visual understanding,”&amp;nbsp;as well as on 200 languages,&amp;nbsp;according to Meta.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Llama 4 Scout and Maverick are Meta’s first open-weight natively multimodal models.&amp;nbsp;They’re&amp;nbsp;built using a “mixture-of-experts” (MoE) architecture, which reduces computational load&amp;nbsp;and improves efficiency in training and inference. Scout, for example, has 16 experts, and Maverick has 128 experts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Llama 4 Behemoth includes 16 experts, and Meta is referring to it as a teacher for the smaller models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Llama 4 builds on the Llama 3 series, which included 3.1 and 3.2 models widely used for instruction-tuned applications and cloud deployment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-can-llama-do"&gt;What can Llama do? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other generative AI models, Llama can perform a range of different assistive tasks, like coding and answering basic math questions, as well as summarizing documents in&amp;nbsp;at least 12&amp;nbsp;languages (Arabic,&amp;nbsp;English, German, French,&amp;nbsp;Hindi, Indonesian,&amp;nbsp;Italian, Portuguese, Hindi,&amp;nbsp;Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese). Most text-based workloads — think analyzing&amp;nbsp;large&amp;nbsp;files like PDFs and spreadsheets — are within its purview, and all Llama 4&amp;nbsp;models&amp;nbsp;support text, image, and video input.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Llama 4 Scout is designed for longer workflows and massive data analysis. Maverick is a generalist model that is better at balancing reasoning power and response speed, and is suitable for coding, chatbots, and technical assistants. And Behemoth is designed for advanced research, model distillation, and STEM tasks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Llama models, including Llama 3.1, can be configured to&amp;nbsp;leverage&amp;nbsp;third-party applications, tools, and APIs to perform tasks. They are trained to use Brave Search for answering questions about recent events;&amp;nbsp;the Wolfram Alpha API for math- and science-related queries;&amp;nbsp;and a Python interpreter for validating code. However, these tools require&amp;nbsp;proper configuration and are not automatically enabled out of the box.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-can-i-use-llama"&gt;Where can I use Llama?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If&amp;nbsp;you’re&amp;nbsp;looking to simply chat with Llama,&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;powering the Meta AI chatbot experience&amp;nbsp;on Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus,&amp;nbsp;and Meta.ai&amp;nbsp;in 40 countries. Fine-tuned versions of Llama are used in Meta AI experiences in over 200 countries and territories.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Llama 4 models Scout and Maverick are available on Llama.com and Meta’s partners, including the AI developer platform Hugging Face. Behemoth is still in training.&amp;nbsp;Developers&amp;nbsp;building with&amp;nbsp;Llama can download,&amp;nbsp;use,&amp;nbsp;or fine-tune the model across most of the popular cloud platforms.&amp;nbsp;Meta claims it has&amp;nbsp;more than&amp;nbsp;25 partners hosting Llama, including Nvidia, Databricks,&amp;nbsp;Groq, Dell,&amp;nbsp;and Snowflake.&amp;nbsp;And while “selling access” to Meta’s openly available models&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;Meta’s business model, the company makes some money&amp;nbsp;through&amp;nbsp;revenue-sharing agreements&amp;nbsp;with model hosts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some of these partners have built&amp;nbsp;additional&amp;nbsp;tools and services on top of Llama, including tools that let the models reference proprietary data and enable them to run at lower latencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Importantly, the Llama license&amp;nbsp;constrains how developers can deploy the model: App developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta that the company will grant on its discretion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May 2025, Meta launched a&amp;nbsp;new program&amp;nbsp;to incentivize startups to adopt its Llama models. Llama for Startups gives companies support from Meta’s Llama team and access to potential funding.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside Llama, Meta provides tools intended to make the model “safer” to use:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Llama Guard&lt;/strong&gt;, a moderation framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CyberSecEval&lt;/strong&gt;, a cybersecurity risk assessment suite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Llama Firewall&lt;/strong&gt;, a security guardrail designed to enable building secure AI systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Shield&lt;/strong&gt;, which provides support for inference-time filtering of insecure code produced by LLMs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Llama&amp;nbsp;Guard tries to detect potentially problematic content either fed into — or generated — by a Llama model, including content relating to criminal activity, child exploitation, copyright violations, hate, self-harm and sexual abuse.&amp;nbsp;That said,&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;clearly not a silver bullet since&amp;nbsp;Meta’s own previous guidelines&amp;nbsp;allowed the chatbot to engage in sensual and romantic chats with minors, and some reports show those&amp;nbsp;turned&amp;nbsp;into&amp;nbsp;sexual conversations.&amp;nbsp;Developers can&amp;nbsp;customize&amp;nbsp;the categories of blocked content and apply the blocks to all the languages Llama supports.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like Llama Guard, Prompt Guard can block text intended for Llama, but only text meant to “attack” the model and get it to behave in undesirable ways. Meta claims that&amp;nbsp;Llama&amp;nbsp;Guard can defend against explicitly malicious prompts (i.e., jailbreaks that&amp;nbsp;attempt&amp;nbsp;to get around Llama’s built-in safety filters) in addition to prompts that&amp;nbsp;contain&amp;nbsp;“injected inputs.”&amp;nbsp;The Llama Firewall works to detect and prevent risks like prompt injection, insecure code, and risky tool interactions. And Code Shield helps mitigate insecure code suggestions and offers secure command execution for seven programming languages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for&amp;nbsp;CyberSecEval,&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;less a tool than a collection of benchmarks to measure model security.&amp;nbsp;CyberSecEval&amp;nbsp;can assess the risk a Llama model poses (at least according to Meta’s criteria) to app developers and end users in areas like “automated social engineering” and “scaling offensive cyber operations.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-llama-s-limitations"&gt;Llama’s limitations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3054573" height="328" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Llama-4-coding-benchmark.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Artificial Analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Llama comes with certain risks and limitations, like all generative AI models.&amp;nbsp;For example, while its most recent model has multimodal features, those are&amp;nbsp;mainly limited&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;the English&amp;nbsp;language&amp;nbsp;for now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zooming out,&amp;nbsp;Meta used a dataset of pirated e-books&amp;nbsp;and articles to train its Llama models. A federal judge recently sided with Meta in a copyright lawsuit brought against the company by 13 book authors, ruling that&amp;nbsp;the use of copyrighted works for training fell under “fair use.” However, if Llama&amp;nbsp;regurgitates&amp;nbsp;a copyrighted snippet&amp;nbsp;and someone uses it in a product, they could potentially be infringing on copyright and be liable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta also&amp;nbsp;controversially trains its AI on Instagram and Facebook posts,&amp;nbsp;photos&amp;nbsp;and captions, and&amp;nbsp;makes it difficult for users to opt out.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Programming is another area where&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;wise to tread lightly when using Llama.&amp;nbsp;That’s&amp;nbsp;because Llama might —&amp;nbsp;perhaps&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;so than&amp;nbsp;its generative AI counterparts —&amp;nbsp;produce buggy or insecure code.&amp;nbsp;On&amp;nbsp;LiveCodeBench, a&amp;nbsp;benchmark&amp;nbsp;that tests AI models on competitive coding problems, Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick model achieved a score of 40%.&amp;nbsp;That’s&amp;nbsp;compared to&amp;nbsp;85% for OpenAI’s GPT-5 high&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;83% for&amp;nbsp;xAI’s&amp;nbsp;Grok 4 Fast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As always,&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;best to have a human expert review any AI-generated code before incorporating it into a service or software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, as with other AI models, Llama models are still guilty of generating&amp;nbsp;plausible-sounding&amp;nbsp;but false or misleading information, whether&amp;nbsp;that’s&amp;nbsp;in coding, legal guidance, or&amp;nbsp;emotional conversations with AI personas.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was originally published on September 8, 2024 and is updated regularly with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Like every Big Tech company these days, Meta has its own flagship generative AI model, called Llama.

&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scout:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;17 billion active parameters, 109 billion total parameters, and a context window of 10 million tokens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maverick:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;17 billion active parameters, 400 billion total parameters, and a context window of 1 million tokens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behemoth&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Not yet released&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;have 288 billion active&amp;nbsp;parameters&amp;nbsp;and 2 trillion total parameters.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(In data science, tokens are subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables “fan,” “tas” and “tic” in the word “fantastic.”)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A model’s context, or context window, refers to input data (e.g., text) that the model considers before generating output (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;additional&amp;nbsp;text).

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Importantly, the Llama license&amp;nbsp;constrains how developers can deploy the model: App developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta that the company will grant on its discretion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May 2025, Meta launched a&amp;nbsp;new program&amp;nbsp;to incentivize startups to adopt its Llama models. Llama for Startups gives companies support from Meta’s Llama team and access to potential funding.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside Llama, Meta provides tools intended to make the model “safer” to use:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Llama Guard&lt;/strong&gt;, a moderation framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CyberSecEval&lt;/strong&gt;, a cybersecurity risk assessment suite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Llama Firewall&lt;/strong&gt;, a security guardrail designed to enable building secure AI systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Shield&lt;/strong&gt;, which provides support for inference-time filtering of insecure code produced by LLMs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Llama&amp;nbsp;Guard tries to detect potentially problematic content either fed into — or generated — by a Llama model, including content relating to criminal activity, child exploitation, copyright violations, hate, self-harm and sexual abuse.&amp;nbsp;That said,&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;clearly not a silver bullet since&amp;nbsp;Meta’s own previous guidelines&amp;nbsp;allowed the chatbot to engage in sensual and romantic chats with minors, and some reports show those&amp;nbsp;turned&amp;nbsp;into&amp;nbsp;sexual conversations.&amp;nbsp;Developers can&amp;nbsp;customize&amp;nbsp;the categories of blocked content and apply the blocks to all the languages Llama supports.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like Llama Guard, Prompt Guard can block text intended for Llama, but only text meant to “attack” the model and get it to behave in undesirable ways. Meta claims that&amp;nbsp;Llama&amp;nbsp;Guard can defend against explicitly malicious prompts (i.e., jailbreaks that&amp;nbsp;attempt&amp;nbsp;to get around Llama’s built-in safety filters) in addition to prompts that&amp;nbsp;contain&amp;nbsp;“injected inputs.”&amp;nbsp;The Llama Firewall works to detect and prevent risks like prompt injection, insecure code, and risky tool interactions. And Code Shield helps mitigate insecure code suggestions and offers secure command execution for seven programming languages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for&amp;nbsp;CyberSecEval,&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;less a tool than a collection of benchmarks to measure model security.&amp;nbsp;CyberSecEval&amp;nbsp;can assess the risk a Llama model poses (at least according to Meta’s criteria) to app developers and end users in areas like “automated social engineering” and “scaling offensive cyber operations.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-llama-s-limitations"&gt;Llama’s limitations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3054573" height="328" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Llama-4-coding-benchmark.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Artificial Analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Llama comes with certain risks and limitations, like all generative AI models.&amp;nbsp;For example, while its most recent model has multimodal features, those are&amp;nbsp;mainly limited&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;the English&amp;nbsp;language&amp;nbsp;for now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zooming out,&amp;nbsp;Meta used a dataset of pirated e-books&amp;nbsp;and articles to train its Llama models. A federal judge recently sided with Meta in a copyright lawsuit brought against the company by 13 book authors, ruling that&amp;nbsp;the use of copyrighted works for training fell under “fair use.” However, if Llama&amp;nbsp;regurgitates&amp;nbsp;a copyrighted snippet&amp;nbsp;and someone uses it in a product, they could potentially be infringing on copyright and be liable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta also&amp;nbsp;controversially trains its AI on Instagram and Facebook posts,&amp;nbsp;photos&amp;nbsp;and captions, and&amp;nbsp;makes it difficult for users to opt out.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Programming is another area where&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;wise to tread lightly when using Llama.&amp;nbsp;That’s&amp;nbsp;because Llama might —&amp;nbsp;perhaps&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;so than&amp;nbsp;its generative AI counterparts —&amp;nbsp;produce buggy or insecure code.&amp;nbsp;On&amp;nbsp;LiveCodeBench, a&amp;nbsp;benchmark&amp;nbsp;that tests AI models on competitive coding problems, Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick model achieved a score of 40%.&amp;nbsp;That’s&amp;nbsp;compared to&amp;nbsp;85% for OpenAI’s GPT-5 high&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;83% for&amp;nbsp;xAI’s&amp;nbsp;Grok 4 Fast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As always,&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;best to have a human expert review any AI-generated code before incorporating it into a service or software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, as with other AI models, Llama models are still guilty of generating&amp;nbsp;plausible-sounding&amp;nbsp;but false or misleading information, whether&amp;nbsp;that’s&amp;nbsp;in coding, legal guidance, or&amp;nbsp;emotional conversations with AI personas.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s impressive growth comes as OpenAI is on a race to&amp;nbsp;secure as many AI chips&amp;nbsp;and build as much&amp;nbsp;AI infrastructure&amp;nbsp;as possible. In August, OpenAI said it was on the cusp of reaching&amp;nbsp;700 million weekly active users, already an increase from 500 million weekly active users at the end of March.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Today, 4 million developers have built with&amp;nbsp;OpenAI,” Altman said. “More than 800 people use&amp;nbsp;ChatGPT every week, and we process over 6 billion tokens per minute on the API.&amp;nbsp;Thanks to all of you,&amp;nbsp;AI has gone from something people build play with to something people build with every day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman made the announcement during the keynote presentation for OpenAI’s Dev Day, which also included announcement for new tools for building apps inside of ChatGPT, as well as constructing more complex agentic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized, that you can chat with,” Altman said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT saw unprecedented user growth almost immediately, becoming both the preeminent consumer AI product and one of fastest-growing online services ever. More recently the tool expanded into proactive services with OpenAI Pulse, sending customized morning briefs to participating users. The service has also been dogged by concerns about sycophancy andAI-induced delusions, particularly in the recent case of Allan Brooks, who was misled into believing he’d made a novel mathematical discovery with ChatGPT’s help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still legally designated as a non-profit, OpenAI became the most valuable privately held company in the world on Thursday, after a private stock sale of $6.6 billion in shares valued the company at $500 billion. The company has also been launching new products at a blistering pace, releasing a new version of its video-generation tool Sora last week, paired with an accompanying social media network. That same week, the company partnered with Stripe to launch a platform for agentic commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

Starting Monday, users in ChatGPT will be able to access interactive applications from companies like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva. OpenAI is also launching a preview of the Apps SDK on Monday, the developer-facing toolkit to build these apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made the announcement at its annual developer conference, DevDay 2025. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We want ChatGPT to be a great way for people to make progress, to be more productive, more inventive, to learn faster, to do whatever they’re trying to do in their lives better,” said CEO Sam Altman. “[Apps inside of ChatGPT] will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized, that you can chat with.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new system is OpenAI’s latest attempt to build an ecosystem of apps around its flagship AI product, ChatGPT. The launch follows OpenAI’s previous attempts to let developers build interactive applications, such as through its GPT Store. Unlike that product, which asked ChatGPT users to access a separate app store, Monday’s launch puts apps directly in ChatGPT’s responses, and lets users call up different applications in their everyday conversations. This gives developers better distribution for the apps they build, and aims to make a richer experience for users in ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By calling out the names of different apps, users can draw in content from a variety of services. For example, ChatGPT users can say “Figma, turn this sketch into a workable diagram” to call up the Figma app. Users can also call up the Coursera app by asking, “Coursera, can you teach me something about machine learning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a demo of Zillow’s application, users could prompt ChatGPT in natural language to search for apartments in their area within a specific price range. ChatGPT then pulled up an interactive map showing options, and users could talk with ChatGPT to learn more about each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3054625" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;(Credit: Zillow)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT will also surface relevant apps when they could be helpful to a user. If someone asks for a playlist for a party this weekend, ChatGPT may call up the Spotify app in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says the new system is built using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows developers to connect their data sources to an AI systems. ChatGPT apps can also trigger actions, and render a fully interactive UI in the chatbot’s responses. Certain apps are able to display videos in ChatGPT, which will be pinned to the top of the web-page and can be altered based on user requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If users are already subscribed to a product, they’ll be able to login to their account directly in ChatGPT to access certain features. Altman also says OpenAI will support ways to monetize apps inside of ChatGPT in the future, including through the company’s recently launched Instant Checkout feature in ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the future, OpenAI says apps like DoorDash, Instacart, Uber, and AllTrails will be available in ChatGPT as well.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A key questions around apps in ChatGPT will be privacy, and how much data third party developers will have access to. OpenAI says developers must “collect only the minimum data they need, and be transparent about permissions.” However, it’s unclear whether developers would have access to a user’s entire conversation with ChatGPT, the past few messages, or just the prompt that summoned up the app.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI is launching a new way for developers to build applications inside of ChatGPT.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AgentKit&amp;nbsp;is a complete set of building blocks available in the open AI platform designed to help you take agents from prototype to production. It is everything you need to build, deploy, and optimize agent workflows with way less friction,” Altman said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch highlights OpenAI’s push to increase developer adoption by making agent building faster and easier. It also signals a competitive move against other AI platforms racing to offer integrated tools for building autonomous agents for enterprises that can perform complex tasks, not just respond to prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AgentKit&amp;nbsp;was one of several announcements at OpenAI’s Dev Day,&amp;nbsp;including the launch of the ability to build apps directly inside ChatGPT, which has hit 800 million weekly active users.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AgentKit&amp;nbsp;includes a few core capabilities. The first is Agent Builder, which Altman&amp;nbsp;described&amp;nbsp;as like Canva for building agents.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a fast, visual way to design the logic, steps, ideas,” Altman said. “It’s&amp;nbsp;built on top of the responses API that hundreds of thousands of developers already use.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The second capability of&amp;nbsp;AgentKit&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;ChatKit, which provides a simple embeddable chat interface that developers can use to bring chat experiences into their own apps.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You can bring your own brand, your own workflows, whatever makes your own product unique,” Altman said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Evals for Agents&amp;nbsp;introduces tools to measure AI agent performance, including step-by-step trace grading, datasets for assessing individual agent components, automated prompt optimization, and the ability to run evaluations on external models directly from the OpenAI platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally,&amp;nbsp;AgentKit&amp;nbsp;includes access to OpenAI’s connector registry, so developers can securely connect agents to internal tools and third-party systems through an “admin control panel” while&amp;nbsp;maintaining&amp;nbsp;security and control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To prove how easy it is to use&amp;nbsp;AgentKit, Christina Huang, an OpenAI engineer, built an entire AI workflow and two AI agents live onstage in under eight minutes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is all the stuff that we wished we had when we were trying to build our first agents,” Altman said, noting that OpenAI has already signed on several launch partners that have already scaled agents using&amp;nbsp;AgentKit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-06-at-1.38.49PM.png?resize=1200,670" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Monday announced the launch of&amp;nbsp;AgentKit, a toolkit for building and deploying&amp;nbsp;AI agents,&amp;nbsp;at the firm’s Dev Day event.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AgentKit&amp;nbsp;is a complete set of building blocks available in the open AI platform designed to help you take agents from prototype to production. It is everything you need to build, deploy, and optimize agent workflows with way less friction,” Altman said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch highlights OpenAI’s push to increase developer adoption by making agent building faster and easier. It also signals a competitive move against other AI platforms racing to offer integrated tools for building autonomous agents for enterprises that can perform complex tasks, not just respond to prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AgentKit&amp;nbsp;was one of several announcements at OpenAI’s Dev Day,&amp;nbsp;including the launch of the ability to build apps directly inside ChatGPT, which has hit 800 million weekly active users.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AgentKit&amp;nbsp;includes a few core capabilities. The first is Agent Builder, which Altman&amp;nbsp;described&amp;nbsp;as like Canva for building agents.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a fast, visual way to design the logic, steps, ideas,” Altman said. “It’s&amp;nbsp;built on top of the responses API that hundreds of thousands of developers already use.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The second capability of&amp;nbsp;AgentKit&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;ChatKit, which provides a simple embeddable chat interface that developers can use to bring chat experiences into their own apps.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You can bring your own brand, your own workflows, whatever makes your own product unique,” Altman said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Evals for Agents&amp;nbsp;introduces tools to measure AI agent performance, including step-by-step trace grading, datasets for assessing individual agent components, automated prompt optimization, and the ability to run evaluations on external models directly from the OpenAI platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
