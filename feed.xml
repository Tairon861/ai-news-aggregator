Yet only 16% of digital transformations succeed, and that’s only 4–11% in traditional industries. The main barriers? Weak leadership commitment, a rigid culture, and a lack of digital talent. LayerX offers an AI SaaS platform to help enterprises scale back-office automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LayerX, a Japanese AI SaaS startup that enables businesses to cut back-office workload, has raised $100 million in a Series B round led by Technology Cross Ventures (TCV), marking the U.S. fund’s first investment in a Japanese startup.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company declined to disclose its valuation, but said both the valuation and the size of the round are among the largest ever raised by a seven-year-old Japanese startup at the Series B stage. Other investors, including MUFG Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Innovation Partners, JAFCO Group, Keyrock Capital, Coreline Venture, and JP Investment, also joined the Series B round, bringing the total raised to $192.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup’s key offerings include Bakuraku, a platform that automates corporate spending workflows, covering expense management, invoice processing, and corporate card operations — for more than 15,000 companies; Alterna, a retail digital securities investment platform developed in partnership with Mitsui &amp;amp; Co.; and Ai Workforce, a generative AI solution designed to streamline workflows and harness enterprise data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2018 by serial entrepreneur Yoshinori Fukushima, who studied machine learning at the University of Tokyo and previously launched the news app Gunosy, which was later listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, LayerX grew out of one of his digital transformation (DX) and blockchain projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The founder launched LayerX after identifying a significant bottleneck in Japan’s enterprise workflows: paper-based invoice processing. This insight prompted the team to pivot into SaaS with their AI-driven platform, Bakuraku, Fukushima told TechCrunch, adding that the platform’s AI-native user experience quickly gained traction, helping LayerX secure major strategic partnerships, including with MUFG, or&amp;nbsp;Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and paving the way for its latest funding round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite a wave of digitalization, many Japanese companies still rely on paper and Excel for expense reimbursements and invoice processing, the CEO continued. Domestically, the startup competes with Money Forward Cloud Keihi, freee, and Rakuraku Seisan. Globally, its rivals include SAP Concur, Rippling, Brex, Ramp, Spendesk, and Airbase. In the AI Workforce space, it faces competition from Harvey, Fukushima noted.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bakuraku differentiates itself with an AI-driven user experience. The company continuously upgrades automation features like “auto-entry and document splitting”, while also investing in AI agents and AI-enabled business processing outsourcing (BPO). Its team includes “more than 12 former CTOs and a Kaggle Grandmaster.” Bakuraku offers a comprehensive, integrated platform covering “expense management, invoice processing, corporate cards, workflows, e-ledger compliance, attendance, and receivables—all in one solution,” Fukushima added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3041362" height="423" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LayerX-CEO-CTO-1.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;CEO of Layerx (Yoshinori Fukushima) and CTO of layerx (Yuki Matsumoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has closed its Series B funding less than two years after securing its Series A in November 2023. Its signature platform, the Bakuraku Suite, has seen significant growth, the seven-year-old company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We passed 10,000 customers in February 2024 and reached 15,000 by April 2025, with more enterprise clients coming on board,” the CEO said. “Headcount has also grown from about 220 employees in October 2023 to around 430 as of the end of July 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LayerX is on track to reach $68 million, equivalent to ¥10 billion, faster than any SaaS company in Japan’s history, according to the company. “The growth benchmark known as T2D3 was achieved ahead of schedule, and we expect to surpass the previous domestic record, which took eight years from product launch, in under five years,” Fukushima said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ai Workforce counts Mitsui &amp;amp; Co. and MUFG Bank among its clients, while Bakuraku serves customers such as Ippudo, IRIS Ohyama, the Imperial Hotel, and Sekisui Chemical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Looking forward, the company targets approximately $680 million (¥100 billion) in annual recurring revenue by fiscal year 2030, with roughly half expected to come from its AI agent business. It also plans to grow its workforce to around 1,000 employees by 2028.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Aging demographics, labor shortages, the adoption of GenAI, and the 2023 implementation of e-invoicing are driving companies to automate finance, tax, procurement, and HR in Japan.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The alliance addresses longstanding funding concerns. In April, Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal drew criticism after slamming domestic startups for focusing on food delivery instead of innovation, contrasting them with Chinese firms in a presentation titled “India vs. China: The Startup Reality Check.” Several investors and founders countered that India lacks capital for deep tech ventures and said Goyal’s comments overlooked the determination of founders building for the local market. The new alliance appears to address these concerns, aiming to channel long-term private capital into deep tech ventures that many founders say have struggled to secure funding in India.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move stands out because investors typically compete for deals rather than formally band together under a named alliance with binding pledges. While VCs often co-invest on a deal-by-deal basis, most cross-border collaboration occurs informally through individual fund strategies, rather than through coordinated capital blocs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Called the India Deep Tech Investment Alliance, the group brings together Celesta Capital, Accel, Blume Ventures, Gaja Capital, Ideaspring Capital, Premji Invest, Tenacity Ventures, and Venture Catalysts, the firms said in a joint statement on Tuesday. The launch follows the Indian government’s approval of a ₹1 trillion (approximately $11 billion) Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) scheme, announced in the national budget earlier this year to boost deep tech R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under the alliance, each member will commit private capital over a 5- to 10-year period to Indian-domiciled deep tech startups, the firms said. For now, there are relatively few such companies, as many of India’s best-known deep tech ventures with Indian founders are incorporated in the U.S. But New Delhi has made local incorporation a requirement for incentives under its new RDI scheme, which the alliance members aim to leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to funding, the members will offer mentorship and network access. The firms also plan to utilize the alliance to help their portfolio companies expand into the Indian market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is in line with the strategic interests of both India and the U.S. at the governmental level, focusing on critical and emerging technologies,” said Celesta Capital managing partner Arun Kumar, who will be the inaugural chair of the alliance, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the geopolitical backdrop is complicated. In February, President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the TRUST (Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology) initiative to deepen U.S.–India tech ties. But relations soon showed strain, as Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods last month over New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil, a move analysts say has put the two leaders on opposite sides of a widening trade and geopolitical rift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite those tensions, the alliance — notwithstanding the geopolitical rift between the two leaders — is betting on India as a hub for startups developing foundational technologies such as AI, semiconductors, space, quantum, robotics, biotech, energy, and climate tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We find India as a particularly interesting market, not just for the opportunities that exist for new companies that get started in India, but also for companies in the U.S. that are seeking to expand into the Indian market,” Sriram Vishwanathan, founding managing partner at Celesta Capital, told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Celesta Capital — an early backer of Indian startups such as space-tech venture Agnikul, drone maker IdeaForge, and AI-driven cancer diagnostics firm OneCell Diagnostics — spearheaded the effort after discussions with industry stakeholders and the Indian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have put this thing together to actually energize the ecosystem and bring like-minded investors together,” Vishwanathan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The alliance will focus on early-stage startups — from seed to Series B — while steering clear of late-stage investments, Vishwanathan noted. He also stated that the billion-dollar-plus commitment is just the beginning, as “any long journey starts with the first step.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You could expect more firms to join this alliance, both financial VC firms and private equity firms,” he said. “You should also expect corporates to join who have pretty significant investment programs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the alliance does not set its own eligibility criteria for new members, Vishwanathan said participants must meet the Indian government’s conditions under the RDI scheme — including investing in “sunrise” sectors, backing India-domiciled startups, and securing local regulatory approvals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The alliance is just a platform for engaging with the government,” he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As a group, the investors in the alliance plan to engage with the Indian government on policy and incentives to advance private industry’s interests and act as a unified voice, Vishwanathan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the past, regulatory changes rolled out without industry input have led to turmoil in India. Some such moves have drawn intense criticism from U.S. investors and were subsequently withdrawn following widespread outrage.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The alliance’s members will share information voluntarily and coordinate on pipeline development, due diligence and co-investment opportunities, the firms said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An advisory committee, comprising representatives from Accel, Premji Invest, and Venture Catalysts, among the early participants, will help establish shared objectives and ensure coordination while preserving the independence of each fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kumar stated that while he is the inaugural chair, the alliance’s leadership will rotate as it moves forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The alliance could prove a double-edged sword for Indian deep tech startups. While pooling long-term capital and giving a unified voice to the government appears to be a boon, there is risk if coordination falters, leaving promising companies caught in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Over the next decade, startups will build in India and export breakthrough solutions to the world. The tailwinds are in place: ambition, talent, policy intent, and patient capital,” said Accel partner Anand Daniel in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/india-flag.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Eight U.S. and Indian venture capital and private equity firms — including storied investors Accel, Blume Ventures, Celesta Capital, and Premji Invest — have formed an unusual coalition to back India’s deep tech startups, pledging more than $1 billion over the next decade to strengthen U.S.-India tech ties.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the geopolitical backdrop is complicated. In February, President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the TRUST (Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology) initiative to deepen U.S.–India tech ties. But relations soon showed strain, as Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods last month over New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil, a move analysts say has put the two leaders on opposite sides of a widening trade and geopolitical rift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite those tensions, the alliance — notwithstanding the geopolitical rift between the two leaders — is betting on India as a hub for startups developing foundational technologies such as AI, semiconductors, space, quantum, robotics, biotech, energy, and climate tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We find India as a particularly interesting market, not just for the opportunities that exist for new companies that get started in India, but also for companies in the U.S. that are seeking to expand into the Indian market,” Sriram Vishwanathan, founding managing partner at Celesta Capital, told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Celesta Capital — an early backer of Indian startups such as space-tech venture Agnikul, drone maker IdeaForge, and AI-driven cancer diagnostics firm OneCell Diagnostics — spearheaded the effort after discussions with industry stakeholders and the Indian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have put this thing together to actually energize the ecosystem and bring like-minded investors together,” Vishwanathan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The alliance will focus on early-stage startups — from seed to Series B — while steering clear of late-stage investments, Vishwanathan noted. He also stated that the billion-dollar-plus commitment is just the beginning, as “any long journey starts with the first step.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You could expect more firms to join this alliance, both financial VC firms and private equity firms,” he said. “You should also expect corporates to join who have pretty significant investment programs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the alliance does not set its own eligibility criteria for new members, Vishwanathan said participants must meet the Indian government’s conditions under the RDI scheme — including investing in “sunrise” sectors, backing India-domiciled startups, and securing local regulatory approvals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The alliance is just a platform for engaging with the government,” he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As a group, the investors in the alliance plan to engage with the Indian government on policy and incentives to advance private industry’s interests and act as a unified voice, Vishwanathan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the past, regulatory changes rolled out without industry input have led to turmoil in India. Some such moves have drawn intense criticism from U.S. investors and were subsequently withdrawn following widespread outrage.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The alliance’s members will share information voluntarily and coordinate on pipeline development, due diligence and co-investment opportunities, the firms said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An advisory committee, comprising representatives from Accel, Premji Invest, and Venture Catalysts, among the early participants, will help establish shared objectives and ensure coordination while preserving the independence of each fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kumar stated that while he is the inaugural chair, the alliance’s leadership will rotate as it moves forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The alliance could prove a double-edged sword for Indian deep tech startups. While pooling long-term capital and giving a unified voice to the government appears to be a boon, there is risk if coordination falters, leaving promising companies caught in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Over the next decade, startups will build in India and export breakthrough solutions to the world. The tailwinds are in place: ambition, talent, policy intent, and patient capital,” said Accel partner Anand Daniel in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/u-s-and-indian-vcs-just-formed-a-1b-alliance-to-fund-indias-deep-tech-startups/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
