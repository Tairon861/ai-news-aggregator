            &lt;p&gt;Computer-aided design (CAD) systems are tried-and-true tools used to design many of the physical objects we use each day. But CAD software requires extensive expertise to master, and many tools incorporate such a high level of detail they don’t lend themselves to brainstorming or rapid prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to make design faster and more accessible for non-experts, researchers from MIT and elsewhere developed an AI-driven robotic assembly system that allows people to build physical objects by simply describing them in words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their system uses a generative AI model to build a 3D representation of an object’s geometry based on the user’s prompt. Then, a second generative AI model reasons about the desired object and figures out where different components should go, according to the object’s function and geometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system can automatically build the object from a set of prefabricated parts using robotic assembly. It can also iterate on the design based on feedback from the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used this end-to-end system to fabricate furniture, including chairs and shelves, from two types of premade components. The components can be disassembled and reassembled at will, reducing the amount of waste generated through the fabrication process.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;They evaluated these designs through a user study and found that more than 90 percent of participants preferred the objects made by their AI-driven system, as compared to different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this work is an initial demonstration, the framework could be especially useful for rapid prototyping complex objects like aerospace components and architectural objects. In the longer term, it could be used in homes to fabricate furniture or other objects locally, without the need to have bulky products shipped from a central facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sooner or later, we want to be able to communicate and talk to a robot and AI system the same way we talk to each other to make things together. Our system is a first step toward enabling that future,” says lead author Alex Kyaw, a graduate student in the MIT departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyaw is joined on the paper by Richa Gupta, an MIT architecture graduate student; Faez Ahmed, associate professor of mechanical engineering; Lawrence Sass, professor and chair of the Computation Group in the Department of Architecture; senior author Randall Davis, an EECS professor and member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); as well as others at Google Deepmind and Autodesk Research. The paper was recently presented at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generating a multicomponent design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While generative AI models are good at generating 3D representations, known as meshes,&amp;nbsp; from text prompts, most do not produce uniform representations of an object’s geometry that have the component-level details needed for robotic assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separating these meshes into components is challenging for a model because assigning components depends on the geometry and functionality of the object and its parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tackled these challenges using a vision-language model (VLM), a powerful generative AI model that has been pre-trained to understand images and text. They task the VLM with figuring out how two types of prefabricated parts, structural components and panel components, should fit together to form an object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are many ways we can put panels on a physical object, but the robot needs to see the geometry and reason over that geometry to make a decision about it. By serving as both the eyes and brain of the robot, the VLM enables the robot to do this,” Kyaw says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A user prompts the system with text, perhaps by typing “make me a chair,” and gives it an AI-generated image of a chair to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the VLM reasons about the chair and determines where panel components go on top of structural components, based on the functionality of many example objects it has seen before. For instance, the model can determine that the seat and backrest should have panels to have surfaces for someone sitting and leaning on the chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It outputs this information as text, such as “seat” or “backrest.” Each surface of the chair is then labeled with numbers, and the information is fed back to the VLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the VLM chooses the labels that correspond to the geometric parts of the chair that should receive panels on the 3D mesh to complete the design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human-AI co-design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user remains in the loop throughout this process and can refine the design by giving the model a new prompt, such as “only use panels on the backrest, not the seat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The design space is very big, so we narrow it down through user feedback. We believe this is the best way to do it because people have different preferences, and building an idealized model for everyone would be impossible,” Kyaw says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The human‑in‑the‑loop process allows the users to steer the AI‑generated designs and have a sense of ownership in the final result,” adds Gupta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the 3D mesh is finalized, a robotic assembly system builds the object using prefabricated parts. These reusable parts can be disassembled and reassembled into different configurations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared the results of their method with an algorithm that places panels on all horizontal surfaces that are facing up, and an algorithm that places panels randomly. In a user study, more than 90 percent of individuals preferred the designs made by their system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also asked the VLM to explain why it chose to put panels in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We learned that the vision language model is able to understand some degree of the functional aspects of a chair, like leaning and sitting, to understand why it is placing panels on the seat and backrest. It isn’t just randomly spitting out these assignments,” Kyaw says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to enhance their system to handle more complex and nuanced user prompts, such as a table made out of glass and metal. In addition, they want to incorporate additional prefabricated components, such as gears, hinges, or other moving parts, so objects could have more functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our hope is to drastically lower the barrier of access to design tools. We have shown that we can use generative AI and robotics to turn ideas into physical objects in a fast, accessible, and sustainable manner,” says Davis.&lt;/p&gt;

AI is now changing this, enabling teams to accelerate decision-making, enhance margins, and improve project outcomes. According to new research from Dodge Construction Network (Dodge) and CMiC, the true transformative impact of AI is highlighted by contractors, with 87% believing AI will “meaningfully transform their business,” despite current low adoption rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest research, entitled, ‘AI for Contractors,’ discovered automated proposal generation and progress tracking from site photos both reached a 92% effectiveness rating. Meanwhile, contract risk review achieved 85% effectiveness when compared to previous, more traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report highlights how AI is allowing project managers to focus on strategic decisions rather than time-consuming administrative tasks. Finance teams are also benefiting from AI technology, shifting from historical reporting to predictive insights, while operations leaders are able to apply data-driven intelligence for improved project delivery. Rather than AI fully replacing human expertise, the report found it actually enhances human input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For decades, construction firms have lacked the tools to transform the data they’ve collected into action. AI-enabled solutions are changing that,” says Gord Rawlins, president and CEO of CMiC. “This research highlights the high-impact results contractors are achieving today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI changing contractor roles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveyed contractors see AI as a catalyst in reshaping everyday aspects of their operations, enabling predictive insights rather than reacting to problems once they have occurred. This introduces wider benefits, like tighter cost controls, improved scheduling, and higher quality project delivery. In other words, improved overall outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A substantial 85% of contractors foresee less time spent on repetitive tasks, while 75% have faith that AI can help mine historical data to learn from previous projects. Rather than relying fully on AI, 70% said the technology helps them make better, more informed decisions thanks to insights that may otherwise not be present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI implementation remains low, but companies are preparing for wider adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, AI adoption in the construction industry is low, despite awareness levels of 32% to 34%. This seems to be due to several reasons, including a lack of clear understanding, internal approvals, and software access. However, Dodge’s research discovered more than half of companies surveyed are strategically preparing for AI with pilot programmes and staff training for AI-related positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the report, 40% of companies have a set budget for AI, 38% are developing teams for implementation, 19% are adapting old workflows, and 51% are assessing AI changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early adopters lead the way&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall awareness of AI use in the industry is quite low, with just 20% to 50% of contractors knowing that certain management tasks implement AI, and very few actively use these functions. Nevertheless, early adopters of AI provided positive feedback, as more than 70% revealed that AI tools are hugely effective compared to more traditional methods, suggesting a potential for quick growth in AI use throughout the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Security and accuracy lead concerns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main concerns of adopting AI revolve around security and accuracy. The report reveals that 57% are worried about the accuracy of AI output, while 54% have doubts over the security of company data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal resistance to change (44%) and implementation costs (41%) are also cited as key concerns, but perhaps surprisingly, just 21% expressed concern over job losses. 31% believe current data quality is not yet adequate to support AI analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the report, larger contractors are likely to rely more on AI than smaller firms, thus are more concerned about data quality and reliability. For instance, 69% of larger contractors cited lack of reliability or accuracy of AI outputs as a major concern, compared to 54% of smaller or mid-size contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research data confirms that contractors are generally open to adopting AI, but the accuracy of AI outputs tend to stand in the way, as well as the desire for better tools, more information, and greater internal support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17% of contractors said they do not sufficiently trust AI results, an issue that becomes more pronounced in sensitive areas like payments. Distrust in AI operations rises to 35% and 31% not having faith in AI managing project budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major theme is the need for more understanding before using AI. On average, 21% of respondents said they want a better insight of how AI works before considering using it, climbing to 31% for more complex tasks like safety risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contractors also believe they are limited by their current software capabilities, with an average of 19% reporting their software does not offer the AI functions they require. The increases to 33% for managing resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal approval remains a notable obstacle, with 22% saying their company has not yet approved the use of AI, despite personal interest. Another barrier is a lack of time or resources that effectively evaluate AI tools. 13% stated this as a main reason why AI has not yet been adopted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are obvious challenges to mass AI use in the construction industry – and therefore significant market opportunity – only 5% believe AI would not be beneficial or improve current methods. That indicates a resistance that stems from various concerns rather than a lack of perceived value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Jones, Senior Director, Industry Insights Analytics at Dodge, spoke on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We designed this study to look at the use of AI in the digital tools already deployed by contractors because that may offer the best solution to the challenge of data quality. But it is also heartening to see that many contractors are aware of the key challenges and the need for a rigorous approach to successfully implementing these tools at their organisations,” the Dodge research states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key interest in emerging AI functionalities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI’s potential is clearly recognised, even if the industry’s readiness to adopt it isn’t quite matching the data. Certain areas are attracting the most attention when it comes to AI functions, like automated construction analysis, where 81% see potential benefits. 80% also show interest in intelligent permit submissions, while 79% believe in autonomous schedule and resource optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;92% appreciate automated contract management and 76% recognise potential in AI-powered dynamic pricing. Although AI adoption remains limited, these strong numbers suggest the tide may soon be turning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI and the new age of the construction industry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest data suggests a strong openness, maybe even an eagerness, to AI adoption in the construction sector. However, better tools, clearer guidance, and more trustworthy outputs are just some of the areas that need to be addressed before interest becomes implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With high awareness, strong interest, and powerful validation from early adopters, contractors appear poised for significant expansion in their use of AI-enabled tools in meaningful ways,” said Steve Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry is on a “tipping point for AI adoption” according to Jones. When companies start to provide clearer pathways for adoption, the move towards AI-powered construction workflows will undoubtedly accelerate rapidly, reshaping how projects are delivered forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Tianjin Construction Site.” by @yakobusan Jakob Montrasio is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

On average, 21% of respondents said they want a better insight of how AI works before considering using it, climbing to 31% for more complex tasks like safety risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contractors also believe they are limited by their current software capabilities, with an average of 19% reporting their software does not offer the AI functions they require. The increases to 33% for managing resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal approval remains a notable obstacle, with 22% saying their company has not yet approved the use of AI, despite personal interest. Another barrier is a lack of time or resources that effectively evaluate AI tools. 13% stated this as a main reason why AI has not yet been adopted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are obvious challenges to mass AI use in the construction industry – and therefore significant market opportunity – only 5% believe AI would not be beneficial or improve current methods. That indicates a resistance that stems from various concerns rather than a lack of perceived value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Jones, Senior Director, Industry Insights Analytics at Dodge, spoke on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We designed this study to look at the use of AI in the digital tools already deployed by contractors because that may offer the best solution to the challenge of data quality. But it is also heartening to see that many contractors are aware of the key challenges and the need for a rigorous approach to successfully implementing these tools at their organisations,” the Dodge research states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key interest in emerging AI functionalities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI’s potential is clearly recognised, even if the industry’s readiness to adopt it isn’t quite matching the data. Certain areas are attracting the most attention when it comes to AI functions, like automated construction analysis, where 81% see potential benefits. 80% also show interest in intelligent permit submissions, while 79% believe in autonomous schedule and resource optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;92% appreciate automated contract management and 76% recognise potential in AI-powered dynamic pricing. Although AI adoption remains limited, these strong numbers suggest the tide may soon be turning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI and the new age of the construction industry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest data suggests a strong openness, maybe even an eagerness, to AI adoption in the construction sector. However, better tools, clearer guidance, and more trustworthy outputs are just some of the areas that need to be addressed before interest becomes implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With high awareness, strong interest, and powerful validation from early adopters, contractors appear poised for significant expansion in their use of AI-enabled tools in meaningful ways,” said Steve Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry is on a “tipping point for AI adoption” according to Jones. When companies start to provide clearer pathways for adoption, the move towards AI-powered construction workflows will undoubtedly accelerate rapidly, reshaping how projects are delivered forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Tianjin Construction Site.” by @yakobusan Jakob Montrasio is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This is redefining roles and expectations, while workloads continue to increase and pressure intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the employment landscape transforms, it has become clear that the future of work and talent will be defined by three main areas – continuous education, greater flexibility, and AI literacy. This is according to new research conducted by The Harris Poll, who discovered that employers who invest heavily in educational benefits and AI development gain key advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priya Krishnan, Chief Transformation Officer, Bright Horizons, said, “AI is rewriting job descriptions fast… employers who invest in education benefits and AI training now will build resilient, innovative teams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI skills demand heightens with workloads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the 2025 EdAssist by Bright Horizons Education Index, 42% of US employees are expecting AI to significantly change their role over the next year, despite only 17% actively using AI on a frequent basis. However, the report revealed that the increased adoption of AI is not the key talking point – it’s the urgent skills mandate AI has triggered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers now feel they have to evolve to remain competitive, with 32% feeling increased pressure to learn new skills because of AI, an increase from 26% in 2024. The demand for upskilling comes as workforce stress hits new heights. For instance, 81% of employees report being pushed to take on greater workloads, and 80% stated they are expected to deliver work faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI has the ability to reduce some of this strain, but without proper guidance and training, employees will struggle to use it effectively. The report found that the adoption of AI technology rises to 76% when employers provide AI training, while workers who have access to training (84%) reported feeling more prepared for potential changes than those without (48%). Essentially, effective training turns uncertainty into confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, 34% of those surveyed said they feel unprepared for changes driven by AI, and 42% said their employers expected them to develop their understanding of AI alone, without any formal training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI is rewriting job descriptions faster than most organisations can keep up,” said Priya Krishnan, Chief Transformation Officer at Bright Horizons. “Employers who act now will not only close important skill gaps but also build a culture of resilience and innovation. This is not about chasing trends but creating a workforce that thrives in a world where technology and human capability advance together. Education benefits, flexible learning, and AI literacy are the foundation for long-term competitiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Education benefits drive retention and readiness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EdIndex highlights how investing in employee education can pay off, both for employees and employers. However, challenges are still present, with a key concern being financial barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the report, the skills gap is not simply about technology, it’s about “access and affordability.” 48% of employees surveyed said they avoid further education, citing the “fear of student debt” as the main reason. 34% reported that they cannot afford any more student loan debt, therefore curtailing any career advancement and blocking opportunities. The underscores the need for affordable, employer-sponsored learning programmes that allow employees the chance to progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees highly value education support, with 85% reporting that they would be more loyal to employers that invest in continuing education. 86% said they would choose a job that offers such opportunities over one that doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;82% believe employer support for learning is crucial, while 29% aid it is essential for their job. In addition, 74% said they would be more loyal to an employer if they helped pay off their student loans, further emphasising how the alleviation of financial obstacles drives loyalty and retention, as well as ROI for employers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over half (55%) of respondents are more likely to remain with a company if AI training or certification is available, and 76% actively use AI when training has been provided, compared to only 25% without formal training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2026 predictions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead to 2026, the report highlights five key shifts and how employers can start preparing now. First, the report predicts AI literacy will become essential in the workplace as automation affects almost all jobs. Therefore, companies need to develop AI training programmes and ongoing support that enable employees to feel confident when using new tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, upskilling is set to give employers and employees a significant competitive advantage. Organisations that invest heavily in both technical and soft skills will be better equipped for innovation and adaption going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, flexible education benefits will be key to ensuring employee retention. Workers are increasingly seeking employers who provide financial support and remove financial barriers that limit their learning, so those who offer certain “perks,” like debt-free programmes and tuition support will be more likely to attract and retain talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth major prediction is how continuous learning will become a key component of workplace environments. With roles evolving, the report says employers must set clear career pathways with personalised learning plans that help their employees grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, work-life balance is expected to play a huge role. Companies that blend education benefits with flexibility and well-being support that reduces stress have a higher chance of maintaining a loyal workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pressure remains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although career satisfaction appears high at 87%, workers are under continuing pressure, with 78% feeling pushed to perform tasks outside their main role. As a result, priorities are shifting quickly. While earning a raise remains an important factor with 57% naming it a key priority, work-life balance (43%) and stress reduction (35%) are surging, rising sharply from 2024’s numbers of 35% and 29% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While 90% say they feel somewhat prepared as their job role evolves, this confidence drops when AI is brought into the equation, as just 66% feel ready for AI’s certain impact. AI may be easing some areas of work, but its presence is also rising workplace pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 EdAssist report suggests, “The employers who act now by embedding skill development opportunities, AI training, short-form learning, and debt-conscious benefits into their talent strategy will future-proof their business and avoid being left behind as the competition for skills intensifies.” Only when employers take these steps can they build a workforce capable of sustaining long-term growth and navigating the changes that lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “HMS St Albans’ Ship’s Company conduct a training day in the Plymouth exercise areas” by Royal Navy Media Archive is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;US military contractors are rolling out new GPS satellites that use stronger, cleverer signals, and engineers are working on providing better navigation information based on other sources, like cellular transmissions and visual data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But another approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites. As GPS interference becomes more of a problem, research on quantum navigation is leaping ahead, with many researchers and companies now rushing to test new devices and techniques. In recent months, the US’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its Defense Innovation Unit have announced new grants to test the technology on military vehicles and prepare for operational deployment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most obvious way to navigate is to know where you started and then track where you go by recording the speed, direction, and duration of travel. But while this approach, known in the field as inertial navigation, is conceptually simple, it’s difficult to do well; tiny uncertainties in any of those measurements compound over time and lead to big errors later on. Douglas Paul, the principal investigator of the UK’s Hub for Quantum Enabled Precision, Navigation &amp;amp; Timing (QEPNT), says that existing specialized inertial-navigation devices might be off by 20 kilometers after 100 hours of travel. Meanwhile, the cheap sensors commonly used in smartphones produce more than twice that level of uncertainty after just one hour.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“If you’re guiding a missile that flies for one minute, that might be good enough,” he says. “If you’re in an airliner, that’s definitely not good enough.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A more accurate version of inertial navigation instead uses sensors that rely on the quantum behavior of subatomic particles to more accurately measure acceleration, direction, and time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Several companies, like the US-based Infleqtion, are developing quantum gyroscopes, which track a vehicle’s bearing, and quantum accelerometers, which can reveal how far it’s traveled. Infleqtion's sensors are based on a technique called atom interferometry: A beam of rubidium atoms is zapped with precise laser pulses, which split the atoms into two separate paths. Later, other laser pulses recombine the atoms, and they’re measured with a detector. If the vehicle has turned or accelerated while the atoms are in motion, the two paths will be slightly out of phase in a way the detector can interpret.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year the company trialed these inertial sensors on a customized plane flying at a British military testing site. In October of this year, Infleqtion ran its first real-world test of a new generation of inertial sensors that use a steady stream of atoms instead of pulses, allowing for continuous navigation and avoiding long dead times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Infleqtion's atomic clock named Tiqker." class="wp-image-1129375" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251211_Tiqker-Atomic-Clock-embed.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A view of Infleqtion's atomic clock Tiqker. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY INFLEQTION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infleqtion also has an atomic clock, called Tiqker, that can help determine how far a vehicle has traveled. It is a kind of optical clock that uses infrared lasers tuned to a specific frequency to excite electrons in rubidium, which then release photons at a consistent, known rate. The device “will lose one second every 2 million years or so,” says Max Perez, who oversees the project, and it fits in a standard electronics equipment rack. It has passed tests on flights in the UK, on US Army ground vehicles in New Mexico, and, in late October, on a drone submarine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Tiqker operated happily through these conditions, which is unheard-of for previous generations of optical clocks,” says Perez. Eventually the company hopes to make the unit smaller and more rugged by switching to lasers generated by microchips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnetic fields&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vehicles deprived of satellite-based navigation are not entirely on their own; they can get useful clues from magnetic and gravitational fields that surround the planet. These fields vary slightly depending on the location, and the variations, or anomalies, are recorded in various maps. By precisely measuring the local magnetic or gravitational field and comparing those values with anomaly maps, quantum navigation systems can track the location of a vehicle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Allison Kealy, a navigation researcher at Swinburne University in Australia, is working on the hardware needed for this approach. Her team uses a material called nitrogen-vacancy diamond. In NV diamonds, one carbon atom in the lattice is replaced with a nitrogen atom, and one neighboring carbon atom is removed entirely. The quantum state of the electrons at the NV defect is very sensitive to magnetic fields. Carefully stimulating the electrons and watching the light they emit offers a way to precisely measure the strength of the field at the diamond’s location, making it possible to infer where it’s situated on the globe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kealy says these quantum magnetometers have a few big advantages over traditional ones, including the fact that they measure the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field in addition to its strength. That additional information could make it easier to determine location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The technology is far from commercial deployment, but Kealy and several colleagues successfully tested their magnetometer in a set of flights in Australia late last year, and they plan to run more trials this year and next. “This is where it gets exciting, as we transition from theoretical models and controlled experiments to on-the-ground, operational systems,” she says. “This is a major step forward.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delicate systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other teams, like Q-CTRL, an Australian quantum technology company, are focusing on using software to build robust systems from noisy quantum sensors. Quantum navigation involves taking those delicate sensors, honed in the placid conditions of a laboratory, and putting them in vehicles that make sharp turns, bounce with turbulence, and bob with waves, all of which interferes with the sensors’ functioning. Even the vehicles themselves present problems for magnetometers, especially “the fact that the airplane is made of metal, with all this wiring,” says Michael Biercuk, the CEO of Q-CTRL. “Usually there’s 100 to 1,000 times more noise than signal.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After Q-CTRL engineers ran trials of their magnetic navigation system in a specially outfitted Cessna last year, they used machine learning to go through the data and try to sift out the signal from all the noise. Eventually they found they could track the plane’s location up to 94 times as accurately as a strategic-grade conventional inertial navigation system could, according to Biercuk. They announced their findings in a non-peer-reviewed paper last spring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In August Q-CTRL received two contracts from DARPA to develop its "software-ruggedized" mag-nav product, named Ironstone Opal, for defense applications. The company is also testing the technology with commercial partners, including the defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin and Airbus, an aerospace manufacturer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Infleqtion's atomic clock named Tiqker." class="wp-image-1129376" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251211_q-ctrl_ironstoneopal-embed.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;An illustration showing the placement of Q-CTRL's Ironstone Opal in a drone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY Q-CTRL&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Northrop Grumman is working with Q-CTRL to develop a magnetic navigation system that can withstand the physical demands of the real world,” says Michael S. Larsen, a quantum systems architect at the company. “Technology like magnetic navigation and other quantum sensors will unlock capabilities to provide guidance even in GPS-denied or -degraded environments.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Now Q-CTRL is working on putting Ironstone Opal into a smaller, more rugged container appropriate for deployment; currently, “it looks like a science experiment because it is a science experiment,” says Biercuk. He anticipates delivering the first commercial units next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensor fusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Even as quantum navigation emerges as a legitimate alternative to satellite-based navigation, the satellites themselves are improving. Modern GPS III satellites include new civilian signals called L1C and L5, which should be more accurate and harder to jam and spoof than current signals. Both are scheduled to be fully operational later this decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;US and allied military users are intended to have access to far hardier GPS tools, including M-code, a new form of GPS signal that is rolling out now, and Regional Military Protection, a focused GPS beam that will be restricted to small geographic areas. The latter will start to become available when the GPS IIIF generation of satellites is in orbit, with the first scheduled to go up in 2027. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson says new GPS satellites with M-code are eight times as powerful as previous ones, while the GPS IIIF model will be 60 times as strong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other plans involve using navigation satellites in low Earth orbit—the zone inhabited by SpaceX’s internet-providing Starlink constellation—rather than the medium Earth orbit used by GPS. Since objects in LEO are closer to Earth, their signals are stronger, which makes them harder to jam and spoof. LEO satellites also transit the sky more quickly, which makes them harder still to spoof and helps GPS receivers get a lock on their position faster. “This really helps for signal convergence,”&amp;nbsp;says Lotfi Massarweh, a satellite navigation researcher at Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands. “They can get a good position in just a few minutes. So that is a huge leap.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, says Massarweh, navigation will depend not only on satellites, quantum sensors, or any other single technology, but on the combination of all of them. “You need to think always in terms of sensor fusion,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The navigation resources that a vehicle draws on will change according to its environment—whether it’s an airliner, a submarine, or an autonomous car in an urban canyon. But quantum navigation will be one important resource. He says, “If quantum technology really delivers what we see in the literature—if it’s stable over one week rather than tens of minutes—at that point it is a complete game changer.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In late September, a Spanish military plane carrying the country’s defense minister to a base in Lithuania was reportedly the subject of a kind of attack—not by a rocket or anti-aircraft rounds, but by radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The flight landed safely, but it was one of thousands that have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of GPS interference since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;US military contractors are rolling out new GPS satellites that use stronger, cleverer signals, and engineers are working on providing better navigation information based on other sources, like cellular transmissions and visual data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But another approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites. As GPS interference becomes more of a problem, research on quantum navigation is leaping ahead, with many researchers and companies now rushing to test new devices and techniques. In recent months, the US’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its Defense Innovation Unit have announced new grants to test the technology on military vehicles and prepare for operational deployment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most obvious way to navigate is to know where you started and then track where you go by recording the speed, direction, and duration of travel. But while this approach, known in the field as inertial navigation, is conceptually simple, it’s difficult to do well; tiny uncertainties in any of those measurements compound over time and lead to big errors later on. Douglas Paul, the principal investigator of the UK’s Hub for Quantum Enabled Precision, Navigation &amp;amp; Timing (QEPNT), says that existing specialized inertial-navigation devices might be off by 20 kilometers after 100 hours of travel. Meanwhile, the cheap sensors commonly used in smartphones produce more than twice that level of uncertainty after just one hour.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“If you’re guiding a missile that flies for one minute, that might be good enough,” he says. “If you’re in an airliner, that’s definitely not good enough.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A more accurate version of inertial navigation instead uses sensors that rely on the quantum behavior of subatomic particles to more accurately measure acceleration, direction, and time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Several companies, like the US-based Infleqtion, are developing quantum gyroscopes, which track a vehicle’s bearing, and quantum accelerometers, which can reveal how far it’s traveled. Infleqtion's sensors are based on a technique called atom interferometry: A beam of rubidium atoms is zapped with precise laser pulses, which split the atoms into two separate paths. Later, other laser pulses recombine the atoms, and they’re measured with a detector. If the vehicle has turned or accelerated while the atoms are in motion, the two paths will be slightly out of phase in a way the detector can interpret.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year the company trialed these inertial sensors on a customized plane flying at a British military testing site. In October of this year, Infleqtion ran its first real-world test of a new generation of inertial sensors that use a steady stream of atoms instead of pulses, allowing for continuous navigation and avoiding long dead times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Infleqtion's atomic clock named Tiqker." class="wp-image-1129375" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251211_Tiqker-Atomic-Clock-embed.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A view of Infleqtion's atomic clock Tiqker. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY INFLEQTION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infleqtion also has an atomic clock, called Tiqker, that can help determine how far a vehicle has traveled. It is a kind of optical clock that uses infrared lasers tuned to a specific frequency to excite electrons in rubidium, which then release photons at a consistent, known rate. The device “will lose one second every 2 million years or so,” says Max Perez, who oversees the project, and it fits in a standard electronics equipment rack. It has passed tests on flights in the UK, on US Army ground vehicles in New Mexico, and, in late October, on a drone submarine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Tiqker operated happily through these conditions, which is unheard-of for previous generations of optical clocks,” says Perez. Eventually the company hopes to make the unit smaller and more rugged by switching to lasers generated by microchips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnetic fields&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vehicles deprived of satellite-based navigation are not entirely on their own; they can get useful clues from magnetic and gravitational fields that surround the planet. These fields vary slightly depending on the location, and the variations, or anomalies, are recorded in various maps. By precisely measuring the local magnetic or gravitational field and comparing those values with anomaly maps, quantum navigation systems can track the location of a vehicle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Allison Kealy, a navigation researcher at Swinburne University in Australia, is working on the hardware needed for this approach. Her team uses a material called nitrogen-vacancy diamond. In NV diamonds, one carbon atom in the lattice is replaced with a nitrogen atom, and one neighboring carbon atom is removed entirely. The quantum state of the electrons at the NV defect is very sensitive to magnetic fields. Carefully stimulating the electrons and watching the light they emit offers a way to precisely measure the strength of the field at the diamond’s location, making it possible to infer where it’s situated on the globe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kealy says these quantum magnetometers have a few big advantages over traditional ones, including the fact that they measure the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field in addition to its strength. That additional information could make it easier to determine location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The technology is far from commercial deployment, but Kealy and several colleagues successfully tested their magnetometer in a set of flights in Australia late last year, and they plan to run more trials this year and next. “This is where it gets exciting, as we transition from theoretical models and controlled experiments to on-the-ground, operational systems,” she says. “This is a major step forward.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delicate systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other teams, like Q-CTRL, an Australian quantum technology company, are focusing on using software to build robust systems from noisy quantum sensors. Quantum navigation involves taking those delicate sensors, honed in the placid conditions of a laboratory, and putting them in vehicles that make sharp turns, bounce with turbulence, and bob with waves, all of which interferes with the sensors’ functioning. Even the vehicles themselves present problems for magnetometers, especially “the fact that the airplane is made of metal, with all this wiring,” says Michael Biercuk, the CEO of Q-CTRL. “Usually there’s 100 to 1,000 times more noise than signal.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After Q-CTRL engineers ran trials of their magnetic navigation system in a specially outfitted Cessna last year, they used machine learning to go through the data and try to sift out the signal from all the noise. Eventually they found they could track the plane’s location up to 94 times as accurately as a strategic-grade conventional inertial navigation system could, according to Biercuk. They announced their findings in a non-peer-reviewed paper last spring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In August Q-CTRL received two contracts from DARPA to develop its "software-ruggedized" mag-nav product, named Ironstone Opal, for defense applications. The company is also testing the technology with commercial partners, including the defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin and Airbus, an aerospace manufacturer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Infleqtion's atomic clock named Tiqker." class="wp-image-1129376" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251211_q-ctrl_ironstoneopal-embed.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;An illustration showing the placement of Q-CTRL's Ironstone Opal in a drone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY Q-CTRL&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Northrop Grumman is working with Q-CTRL to develop a magnetic navigation system that can withstand the physical demands of the real world,” says Michael S. Larsen, a quantum systems architect at the company. “Technology like magnetic navigation and other quantum sensors will unlock capabilities to provide guidance even in GPS-denied or -degraded environments.”&lt;/p&gt;

But much will be “competed away” to customers.

At risk: operations staff handling account setup, fraud detection, and trade settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New job categories are emerging: “context engineers” ensuring AI systems have proper information, knowledge management specialists, and up-skilled software engineers building agentic systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford researchers analysing ADP data found early-career workers (ages 22-25) in AI-exposed occupations saw 6% employment decline from late 2022 to July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shadow IT, trust, and the “value gap” problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan’s transparency extends to acknowledging significant execution risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without enterprise-grade tools, employees might use consumer-grade AI – exposing sensitive data. JPMorgan built an in-house system for security and control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When AI performs correctly 85-95% of the time, human reviewers may stop checking carefully. The error rate compounds at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When an agentic system does a cascading series of analyses independently for a long time, it raises questions about how humans can trust that,” Waldron told McKinsey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many enterprises face “proof-of-concept hell” – numerous pilots that never reach production because they underestimate integration complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a value gap between what the technology is capable of and the ability to fully capture that in an enterprise,” Waldron told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;. Even with US$18 billion, full realisation takes years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The JPMorgan playbook: What enterprises can learn&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan’s approach offers replicable principles despite scale advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratise access but mandate nothing – the opt-in strategy created viral adoption. Build for security first, particularly in regulated industries. Implement model-agnostic architecture to avoid vendor lock-in. Combine top-down transformation with bottom-up innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segment training by audience. Track ROI with discipline at the initiative level. Acknowledge complexity and plan accordingly – JPMorgan took over two years to build the LLM Suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every enterprise has US$18 billion for technology or 200,000 employees. But core principles – democratisation, security-first architecture, avoiding vendor lock-in, and financial discipline – apply in industries and scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Transformation with eyes wide open&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase’s AI strategy represents enterprise AI’s most transparent case study – complete with industry-leading adoption metrics, measurable ROI growth, and unflinching acknowledgement of workforce displacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank’s success factors are clear: massive capital investment, model-agnostic infrastructure, democratised access paired with financial discipline, and realistic timelines. But Waldron’s candour about trust challenges, the “value gap” between capability and execution, and the multi-year journey ahead suggest that even US$18 billion and 200,000 engaged employees don’t guarantee seamless transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises evaluating their AI strategies, JPMorgan’s lesson isn’t that scale solves everything – it’s that honest assessment of both opportunities and execution risks separates genuine transformation from expensive experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether JPMorgan’s AI strategy is working. It’s whether the 10% workforce reduction and years-long complexity represent acceptable trade-offs for 30-40% annual benefit growth – and how many other enterprises can afford to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: The analysis draws from McKinsey’s October 2025 interview with Derek Waldron and Kevin Buehler, CNBC’s September 2025 exclusive demonstration of LLM Suite, American Banker’s June 2025 Innovation of the Year coverage, and Stanford University research on AI employment effects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Walmart and Amazon drive retail transformation with AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

At risk: operations staff handling account setup, fraud detection, and trade settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New job categories are emerging: “context engineers” ensuring AI systems have proper information, knowledge management specialists, and up-skilled software engineers building agentic systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford researchers analysing ADP data found early-career workers (ages 22-25) in AI-exposed occupations saw 6% employment decline from late 2022 to July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shadow IT, trust, and the “value gap” problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan’s transparency extends to acknowledging significant execution risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without enterprise-grade tools, employees might use consumer-grade AI – exposing sensitive data. JPMorgan built an in-house system for security and control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When AI performs correctly 85-95% of the time, human reviewers may stop checking carefully. The error rate compounds at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When an agentic system does a cascading series of analyses independently for a long time, it raises questions about how humans can trust that,” Waldron told McKinsey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many enterprises face “proof-of-concept hell” – numerous pilots that never reach production because they underestimate integration complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a value gap between what the technology is capable of and the ability to fully capture that in an enterprise,” Waldron told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;. Even with US$18 billion, full realisation takes years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The JPMorgan playbook: What enterprises can learn&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan’s approach offers replicable principles despite scale advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratise access but mandate nothing – the opt-in strategy created viral adoption. Build for security first, particularly in regulated industries. Implement model-agnostic architecture to avoid vendor lock-in. Combine top-down transformation with bottom-up innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segment training by audience. Track ROI with discipline at the initiative level. Acknowledge complexity and plan accordingly – JPMorgan took over two years to build the LLM Suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every enterprise has US$18 billion for technology or 200,000 employees. But core principles – democratisation, security-first architecture, avoiding vendor lock-in, and financial discipline – apply in industries and scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Transformation with eyes wide open&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase’s AI strategy represents enterprise AI’s most transparent case study – complete with industry-leading adoption metrics, measurable ROI growth, and unflinching acknowledgement of workforce displacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank’s success factors are clear: massive capital investment, model-agnostic infrastructure, democratised access paired with financial discipline, and realistic timelines. But Waldron’s candour about trust challenges, the “value gap” between capability and execution, and the multi-year journey ahead suggest that even US$18 billion and 200,000 engaged employees don’t guarantee seamless transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises evaluating their AI strategies, JPMorgan’s lesson isn’t that scale solves everything – it’s that honest assessment of both opportunities and execution risks separates genuine transformation from expensive experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether JPMorgan’s AI strategy is working. It’s whether the 10% workforce reduction and years-long complexity represent acceptable trade-offs for 30-40% annual benefit growth – and how many other enterprises can afford to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: The analysis draws from McKinsey’s October 2025 interview with Derek Waldron and Kevin Buehler, CNBC’s September 2025 exclusive demonstration of LLM Suite, American Banker’s June 2025 Innovation of the Year coverage, and Stanford University research on AI employment effects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Walmart and Amazon drive retail transformation with AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The appeal is obvious: if you’ve ever worn cashmere, you know it’s soft, light, and warm — an impressive fiber that’s hard to give up. Unfortunately, those bargain prices usually come with a catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cashmere comes from the fine undercoat of a handful of goat breeds. Typically, one goat will be sheared twice a year, producing just four to six ounces (113 to 170 grams) of cashmere annually. That’s not a lot of supply for a growing market.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The producers of raw materials are actually under a lot of stress,” Sim Gulati, co-founder and CEO of Everbloom, told TechCrunch. “What you’re seeing now, especially with the advent of $50 cashmere sweaters, is that they’re being sheared way more often. The quality of the fiber is not as good, and it’s creating unsustainable herding practices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rather than try to change herding practices or convince consumers to only buy high-quality cashmere, Gulati and his team at Everbloom had a different idea. The startup, which has raised over $8 million from investors including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV, set out to create an upcycled material that’s nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To do this, Everbloom has created a material science AI called Braid.AI. The model can fine tune various parameters to create fibers with different qualities. Cashmere is one target, but so are other materials widely used in the textile industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its core, Everbloom’s process is the same regardless of final product. To make its material, the company currently collects waste from across the fiber supply chain, including cashmere and wool farms and mills, as well as down bedding suppliers. In the future, it plans to expand to other waste sources, including feathers from the poultry industry. These waste streams share one thing in common: they’re all made of keratin, the key protein that underpins Everbloom’s process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company then chops the waste to size and combines it with proprietary compounds. The mix is pressed through a plastic extrusion machine (which shapes material by forcing it through a die), and the pellets that come out the other end are fed through spinning machines that are normally used to produce polyester fiber. “That equipment is used for 80% of the textile market,” Gulati said. “You have to be a drop in replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To transform waste into new fiber, all of the necessary chemical reactions occur within those two machines. Everbloom can create fibers that replicate everything from polyester to cashmere by using its AI to tweak the formulation and how the two machines process it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup said every fiber it produces should be biodegradable, even the polyester replacement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“All the components that we’re using are biodegradable,” Gulati said, adding that his company is&amp;nbsp;currently running its products through accelerated testing to prove the hypothesis. And because Everbloom uses waste products, the environmental impact will be dramatically lower, he said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, it should be cheaper, too. “We want it to be more economically viable for brands and consumers,” Gulati said. “I don’t believe in a ‘sustainable premium’” — the idea that eco-friendly products should cost more. “In order for a material to be successful — both in the supply chain [and for] the consumer — you have to have both a product benefit and an economic benefit to everyone who touches the product. That’s what we’re aiming for.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Everbloom-fibers.jpeg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cashmere sweaters are everywhere these days, often at unbelievably low prices.

According to &lt;em&gt;Financial News&lt;/em&gt;, the bank has rolled out an internal tool called IB Portal, designed to help bankers assemble client pitches more quickly and with less repetition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitch preparation sits at the centre of investment banking work. Teams pull together market views, deal history, and tailored narratives under tight timelines. Much of that effort repeats work that already exists elsewhere in the organisation. Slides, charts, and precedent analysis are often rebuilt from scratch, even when similar material has been used before by another team or office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IB Portal is meant to reduce that waste. The system searches BNP Paribas’s past pitch materials and uses what the bank describes as “smart prompts” to surface relevant slides, analysis, and supporting content for a new mandate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Holst, head of the corporate clients group at BNP Paribas, said the tool functions like an AI-powered search engine that helps bankers find what matters ahead of a pitch or client meeting. In his words, it can cut research time by days, giving teams more room to focus on strategy and client judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use case matters because it places AI inside real, constrained workflows rather than around them. Pitch decks are not generic documents. They reflect internal viewpoints, client-specific details, and regulatory requirements. Making an AI tool useful in this setting depends less on conversational flair and more on structure. That includes deciding which materials are searchable, setting clear access controls in regions and business lines, and defining how retrieved content moves from internal draft to client-ready output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, that also means traceability. Bankers need to see where information comes from, and anything produced by the system still needs human review before it leaves the firm. Without those checks, the risk of errors or inappropriate disclosure rises quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;BNP Paribas builds AI tools on internal platforms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The portal also fits into a broader internal build-out at BNP Paribas. In June 2025, the bank outlined an “LLM as a Service” platform aimed at giving its business units shared access to large language models in the group’s own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform is run by internal IT teams and hosted in BNP Paribas data centres with dedicated GPU capacity. The bank said it supports a mix of models, including open-source options and systems from Mistral AI, with plans to add models trained on internal data. Intended use cases include internal assistants, document drafting, and information retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other large banks are taking a similar approach. JPMorganChase has pointed to growing use of its internal “LLM Suite”, which provides staff access to models in a controlled environment. Reuters has reported on Goldman Sachs’s investment in AI engineering and its rollout of a proprietary “GS AI Assistant”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS has discussed an internal M&amp;amp;A “co-pilot” used for idea generation. Alongside these in-house efforts, specialist tools like Rogo have found traction at firms including Nomura and Moelis, pointing to demand for finance-specific AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For BNP Paribas, the real test is whether IB Portal becomes part of everyday work rather than a one-off experiment. The potential benefits are straightforward: less time spent searching, fewer duplicated decks, and better reuse of institutional knowledge. The risks are just as familiar. Hallucinated data, unclear sources, and accidental exposure of sensitive information all carry real consequences in banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most stable deployments keep AI tightly constrained. That usually means grounding outputs in approved internal content, applying role-based access controls, recording how tools are used, and requiring human sign-off before anything reaches a client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If IB Portal operates in those boundaries, it offers a practical view of how enterprise AI is taking shape: not as a source of instant answers, but as a faster and safer way to navigate what an organisation already knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Enrico Frascati)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: CEOs still betting big on AI: Strategy vs. return on investment in 2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Are you still excited? When you hear that OpenAI or Google just dropped a new model, do you still get that buzz? Or has the shine come off it, maybe just a teeny bit? Come on, you can be honest with me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Truly, I feel kind of stupid even asking the question, like a spoiled brat who has too many toys at Christmas. AI is mind-blowing. It’s one of the most important technologies to have emerged in decades (despite all its many many drawbacks and flaws and, well, issues).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time I can't help feeling a little bit: &lt;em&gt;Is that it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you feel the same way, there’s good reason for it: The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. We were told that AI would solve climate change. That it would reach human-level intelligence. That it would mean we no longer had to work!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead we got AI slop, chatbot psychosis, and tools that urgently prompt you to write better email newsletters. Maybe we got what we deserved. Or maybe we need to reevaluate what AI is for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s the reality at the heart of a new series of stories, published today, called &lt;strong&gt;Hype Correction&lt;/strong&gt;. We accept that AI is still the hottest ticket in town, but it’s time to re-set our expectations.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven puts it in the package’s intro essay, “You can’t help but wonder: When the wow factor is gone, what’s left? How will we view this technology a year or five from now? Will we think it was worth the colossal costs, both financial and environmental?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the package, James O’Donnell looks at Sam Altman, the ultimate AI hype man, through the medium of his own words. And Alex Heath explains the AI bubble, laying out for us what it all means and what we should look out for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Michelle Kim analyzes one of the biggest claims in the AI hype cycle: that AI would completely eliminate the need for certain classes of jobs.

Are you still excited? When you hear that OpenAI or Google just dropped a new model, do you still get that buzz? Or has the shine come off it, maybe just a teeny bit? Come on, you can be honest with me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Truly, I feel kind of stupid even asking the question, like a spoiled brat who has too many toys at Christmas. AI is mind-blowing. It’s one of the most important technologies to have emerged in decades (despite all its many many drawbacks and flaws and, well, issues).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time I can't help feeling a little bit: &lt;em&gt;Is that it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you feel the same way, there’s good reason for it: The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. We were told that AI would solve climate change. That it would reach human-level intelligence. That it would mean we no longer had to work!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead we got AI slop, chatbot psychosis, and tools that urgently prompt you to write better email newsletters. Maybe we got what we deserved. Or maybe we need to reevaluate what AI is for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s the reality at the heart of a new series of stories, published today, called &lt;strong&gt;Hype Correction&lt;/strong&gt;. We accept that AI is still the hottest ticket in town, but it’s time to re-set our expectations.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven puts it in the package’s intro essay, “You can’t help but wonder: When the wow factor is gone, what’s left? How will we view this technology a year or five from now? Will we think it was worth the colossal costs, both financial and environmental?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the package, James O’Donnell looks at Sam Altman, the ultimate AI hype man, through the medium of his own words. And Alex Heath explains the AI bubble, laying out for us what it all means and what we should look out for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Michelle Kim analyzes one of the biggest claims in the AI hype cycle: that AI would completely eliminate the need for certain classes of jobs. If ChatGPT can pass the bar, surely that means it will replace lawyers? Well, not yet, and maybe not ever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Similarly, Edd Gent tackles the big question around AI coding. Is it as good as it sounds? Turns out the jury is still out.

A blog post from the company highlights the analysis of data from sensors and monitoring systems to spot patterns and flag issues for plant machinery, giving choices to decision-makers that can improve efficiency and safety – plus reduce environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For business leaders at BHP, the useful question was not “Where can we use AI?” but “Which decisions do we make repeatedly, and what information would improve them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org930679b"&gt;Portfolio not showcase&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BHP describes the end-to-end effects of AI on operations, or as it puts it, “from mineral extraction to customer delivery.” Leaders had decided to move beyond pilot rollouts, treating AI as an operational capability. It started with a small set of problems that affected the company’s performance; places where change could be measured in results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company found it could avoid unplanned downtime of machinery, plus it tightened its energy and water use. Each use case addressing a small but impactful problem was given an owner and an accompanying KPI. Results were reviewed with the same regularity used for other operational performance monitoring elsewhere in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org6d6492e"&gt;Where BHP uses AI daily&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to BHP focusing specifically on areas such as predictive maintenance and energy optimisation, it gave consideration to using AI in more adventurous yet important operations such as autonomous vehicles and real-time staff health monitoring. Such categories can translate well to other asset-heavy environments, across logistics, manufacturing, and heavy industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="org060e177"&gt;Predictive maintenance&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictive maintenance is the process of planning repairs in scheduled downtime to reduce unexpected failures and costly, unplanned stoppages. Here, AI models analyse equipment data from on-board sensors and can anticipate maintenance needs. This cuts breakdown numbers and reduces equipment-related safety incidents. BHP runs predictive analytics across most of its load-and-haul fleets and its materials handling systems. A central maintenance centre provides real-time and longer-range indications of machine health and potential failure or degradation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediction has become an integral part of its machinery-heavy operations, where previously, such information was presented as ‘just another’ report, one that could get lost in the bureaucracy of the company. It models and defines thresholds which trigger actions directly to teams planning maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="org581cd2b"&gt;Energy and water optimisation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploying predictive maintenance in this manner at its facilities in Escondida in Chile, the company reports savings of more than three giga-litres of water and 118 gigawatt hours of energy in two years, attributing the gains directly to AI. The technology gives operators real-time options and analytics that identify anomalies and automate corrective actions at multiple facilities, including concentrators and desalination plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson it’s learned is placing AI where decisions happen: When operators and control teams can act on recommendations in real time, improvements compound. Conversely periodic reporting means decisions are only taken if staff both see the results of data, and then decide it’s necessary. The realtime nature of data analysis and the use of triggers-to-action mean the differences becomes quickly apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="org00d25f1"&gt;Autonomy and remote operations&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;BHP is also using more advanced technologies like AI-supported autonomous vehicles and machinery. These are higher-risk areas, and the tech has been found to reduce worker exposure to risk, and cut the human error factor in incidents. At the company, complex operational data flows through regional centres from remote facilities. So, without the use of AI and analytics, staff would not be able to optimise every decision in the way that software achieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of AI-integrated wearables is increasing in many industries, including engineering, utilities, manufacturing, and mining. BHP leads the way in protecting its staff, who often work in very challenging conditions. Wearables can monitor personal conditions, reading heart rate and fatigue indicators, and provide real-time alerts to supervisors. One example might be ‘smart’ hard-hat sensor technology, used by BHP at Escondida, which measures truck driver fatigue by analysing drivers’ brain waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="orgff2e329"&gt;A plan leaders can run&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of industry, decision-makers can draw learnings from BHP’s experiences in deploying AI at the (literal) coal-face. The following plan could help leaders in their own strategies to leverage AI in operational problem-areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose one reliability problem and one resource-efficiency problem that operations teams already track, then attach a KPI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Map the workflow: who will see the output and what action they can take?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put basic governance in place for data quality and model monitoring, then review performance alongside operational KPIs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with decision support in higher-risk processes, and automate only after teams validate controls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Shovel View at a Strip Mining Coal” by rbglasson is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
