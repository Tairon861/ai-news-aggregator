Another former OpenAI staffer who went to work for Murati’s startup is also headed back to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On social media on Wednesday, Murati announced the departure of Barret Zoph, the company’s co-founder and CTO. “We have parted ways with Barret,” Murati said in a post on X. “Soumith Chintala will be the new CTO of Thinking Machines. He is a brilliant and seasoned leader who has made important contributions to the AI field for over a decade, and he’s been a major contributor to our team. We could not be more excited to have him take on this new responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Murati’s announcement made no mention of other departures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just 58 minutes after Murati’s announcement of Zoph’s departure, Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, announced that Zoph would be headed back to OpenAI. “Excited to welcome Barret Zoph, Luke Metz, and Sam Schoenholz back to OpenAI! This has been in the works for several weeks, and we’re thrilled to have them join the team,” Simo wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Metz is another co-founder of Thinking Machines and previously worked for OpenAI for a number of years on the company’s technical staff. So did Schoenholz, whose LinkedIn profile still lists him as working for Thinking Machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zoph previously worked for OpenAI as VP of research, and before that, worked for six years at Google as a research scientist. Murati, who served as the CTO of OpenAI until September 2024, left the company and co-founded Thinking Machines with Zoph and Metz. The startup, where Murati serves as CEO, has amassed significant financial support since then, closing a $2 billion seed round last July, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, which led the round, as well as Accel, Nvidia, AMD, and Jane Street, among others. The round valued the company at $12 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has reached out to both Thinking Machines and OpenAI for comment. Wired reports that the split between Zoph and Thinking Labs wasn’t amicable. Certainly, it’s telling that Murati didn’t write more in her public messaging about his departure from the company.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While talent moves between AI giants are common in Silicon Valley, the departure of co-founders from a startup less than a year after its founding is particularly notable. The loss of two co-founders simultaneously — especially when one served as CTO — could be perceived as a particularly meaningful setback for Thinking Machines, which had assembled a high-profile team of former OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral AI researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has also lost other key personnel, including co-founder Andrew Tulloch, who left to join Meta in October. OpenAI itself has seen numerous co-founders depart to launch or join competing ventures, including John Schulman, who left for Anthropic in August 2024 before joining Thinking Machines as Chief Scientist as its launch in February of last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1258711804.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Former OpenAI exec Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, is saying goodbye to two of its co-founders, both of whom are headed back to OpenAI.

Each system uses multimodal large language models fine-tuned on medical literature and clinical datasets. Each emphasises privacy protections and regulatory disclaimers.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT Health operates as a consumer-facing service with a waitlist for ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro subscribers outside the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. Google’s MedGemma 1.5 releases as an open model through its Health AI Developer Foundations program, available for download via Hugging Face or deployment through Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s Claude for Healthcare integrates into existing enterprise workflows through Claude for Enterprise, targeting institutional buyers rather than individual consumers. The regulatory positioning is consistent across all three.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI states explicitly that Health “is not intended for diagnosis or treatment.” Google positions MedGemma as “starting points for developers to evaluate and adapt to their medical use cases.” Anthropic emphasises that outputs “are not intended to directly inform clinical diagnosis, patient management decisions, treatment recommendations, or any other direct clinical practice applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111594" height="763" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MedGemma15-0a-Hero-1024x763.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benchmark-performance-vs-clinical-validation"&gt;Benchmark performance vs clinical validation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical AI benchmark results improved substantially across all three releases, though the gap between test performance and clinical deployment remains significant. Google reports that MedGemma 1.5 achieved 92.3% accuracy on MedAgentBench, Stanford’s medical agent task completion benchmark, compared to 69.6% for the previous Sonnet 3.5 baseline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model improved by 14 percentage points on MRI disease classification and 3 percentage points on CT findings in internal testing. Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 scored 61.3% on MedCalc medical calculation accuracy tests with Python code execution enabled, and 92.3% on MedAgentBench.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also claims improvements in “honesty evaluations” related to factual hallucinations, though specific metrics were not disclosed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has not published benchmark comparisons for ChatGPT Health specifically,&amp;nbsp;noting&amp;nbsp;instead that “over 230 million people globally ask health and wellness-related questions on ChatGPT every week” based on de-identified analysis of existing usage patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benchmarks measure performance on curated test datasets, not clinical outcomes in practice. Medical errors can have life-threatening consequences, translating benchmark accuracy to clinical utility more complex than in other AI application domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regulatory-pathway-remains-unclear"&gt;Regulatory pathway remains unclear&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulatory framework for these medical AI tools remains ambiguous. In the US, the FDA’s oversight depends on intended use. Software that “supports or provides recommendations to a health care professional about prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease” may require premarket review as a medical device. None of the announced tools has FDA clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liability questions are similarly unresolved. When Banner Health’s CTO Mike Reagin states that the health system was “drawn to Anthropic’s focus on AI safety,” this addresses technology selection criteria, not legal liability frameworks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a clinician relies on Claude’s prior authorisation analysis and a patient suffers harm from delayed care, existing case law provides limited guidance on responsibility allocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory approaches vary significantly across markets. While the FDA and Europe’s Medical Device Regulation provide established frameworks for software as a medical device, many APAC regulators have not issued specific guidance on generative AI diagnostic tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This regulatory ambiguity affects adoption timelines in markets where healthcare infrastructure gaps might otherwise accelerate implementation—creating a tension between clinical need and regulatory caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-administrative-workflows-not-clinical-decisions"&gt;Administrative workflows, not clinical decisions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real deployments remain carefully scoped. Novo Nordisk’s Louise Lind Skov, Director of Content Digitalisation, described using Claude for “document and content automation in pharma development,” focused on regulatory submission documents rather than patient diagnosis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Administration applied MedGemma to extract data from 30,000 pathology reports for policy analysis, not treatment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern suggests institutional adoption is concentrating on administrative workflows where errors are less immediately dangerous—billing, documentation, protocol drafting—rather than direct clinical decision support where medical AI capabilities would have the most dramatic impact on patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical AI capabilities are advancing faster than the institutions deploying them can navigate regulatory, liability, and workflow integration complexities.

          &lt;p&gt;Next week, Volvo shows off its new EX60 SUV to the world. It’s the brand’s next electric vehicle, one built on an all-new, EV-only platform that makes use of the latest in vehicle design trends, like a cell-to-body battery pack, large weight-saving castings, and an advanced electronic architecture run by a handful of computers capable of more than 250 trillion operations per second. This new software-defined platform even has a name: HuginCore, after one of the two ravens that collected information for the Norse god Odin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not Volvo’s first reference to mythology. “We have Thor’s Hammer [Volvo’s distinctive headlight design] and now we have HuginCore… one of the two trusted Ravens of Oden. He sent Hugin and Muninn out to fly across the realms and observe and gather information and knowledge, which they then share with Odin that enabled him to make the right decisions as the ruler of Asgard,” said Alwin Bakkenes, head of global software engineering at Volvo Cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And much like Hugin, the way we look at this technology platform, it collects information from all of the sensors, all of the actuators in the vehicle. It understands the world around the vehicle, and it enables us to actually anticipate around what lies ahead,” Bakkenes told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HuginCore is actually Volvo’s second-generation software-defined vehicle platform, one that incorporates hard-learned lessons from cars like the EX90. “The transformation that we did to really becoming a tech company that has control over its own stack—so hardware and software… I can’t lie. It’s been a tough journey. So the EX90 has been a tough journey to get it to launch. And we also had some issues in the beginning, and the learnings that we took from it, we actually brought into what we’re doing with EX60,” Bakkenes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scalable Product Architecture 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news for existing Volvo owners: The arrival of the platform (called SPA3) and HuginCore&amp;nbsp;doesn’t mean your SPA2 Volvo is going to be abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“Of course there’s, at some point, cars go into maintenance, but the majority of the fleet of cars that we have out, we intend to keep on the latest software baselines,” Bakkenes said. While he wouldn’t be drawn on whether HuginCore will be part of the midlife refresh process for SPA2 cars like the EX90, those SUVs do feature the same powerful Nvidia Drive AGX Orin system-on-a-chip that’s integral to making this all work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The core compute platform as such, even though we’ve made some changes in EX60 and optimized it, a lot of it is actually common with, for example, SPA2. So a lot of code is being… We have what we call the superset tech stack. We have a superset of code and we do manifest-based configuration towards a specific hardware variant, which means that we actually deploy the same towards a SPA2 car and a SPA3 car, for example, in terms of a lot of functionality,” Bakkenes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia isn’t the only thing powering HuginCore, though. Qualcomm is another partner, and it is supplying its Snapdragon 8255 SoC. Together, that gives “a lot of inference compute… and it’s flexible inference compute. So it enables us to develop AI-based algorithm models for self-driving, for other tasks in the car as well, and do that flexibly. And as we do this, it’s not just that we build a car which is great today, but we are building the foundation with Hugin, which is a flexible compute platform which has access to essentially all the sensors and all the actuators in the car so we can evolve this over time,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agentic AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volvo was an early adopter of Google’s automotive services, and it’s adding Gemini to the EX60 to give the car a true conversational AI assistant. I’ve long been on record as in favor of good voice control systems in cars, but they have to be natural, and from the sounds of it, this will be. Yes, you can use it to do things like navigate to a specific address or play a particular song. But you can also be a little more vague. Notwithstanding Volvo’s rocky experience with the EX90, the brand’s long-standing and fiercely defended reputation for safety is reassuring when it comes to integrating AI agents into its cars.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t know exactly where you want to go, you can give vague destination settings; if you want to play a song that you vaguely remember who did it and it was about something, you can talk about it in natural ways and it will actually help you find what you’re looking for, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg,” Bakkenes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI agent knows exactly what car it’s in and has access to all of Volvo’s manuals and resources, as well as the greater Internet. It knows how to use the car and can explain it. “I want to understand how I share my digital key. I can open up a manual or something, but I can actually just ask, how do I share my digital key to a friend or to a valet? Or how do I charge? How do I open the charge lid? How do I do this, et cetera? And it just knows all of these things. So you can converse around it without going through the thick manual,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bakkenes shared examples of using the AI agent to find out if a particular model of TV was in stock at a nearby store, and whether it would fit in his car. You can tell it to remember a location, which it can correlate to appointments in your calendar and suggest directions. Another mode, called Gemini Live, sounds really quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve actually used it in the morning to get information about collecting Reddit feedback, so summarizing Reddit feedback from last week’s feedback on our product, for example. And when I get to work and I open up Gemini, I have the transcript of the discussion, so I can actually pick up there and keep the context. It also keeps context,” Bakkenes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that works as described, it sounds like quite the productivity boost—one I’ll test out by seeing if it helps me write my notes for the EX60 when (if) I get to drive it later this year. Given that it knows everything about the EX60, I even suggested that Volvo have the AI agent give the product briefing during the first drive—we’ll see if the company takes me up on that in time.&lt;/p&gt;

That process is starting to shift. McKinsey has begun using an AI chatbot as part of its graduate recruitment process, signalling a shift in how professional services organisations evaluate early-career candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chatbot is being used during the initial stages of recruitment, where applicants are asked to interact with it as part of their assessment. Rather than replacing interviews or final hiring decisions, the tool is intended to support screening and evaluation earlier in the process. The move reflects a wider trend across large organisations: AI is no longer limited to research or client-facing tools, but is increasingly shaping internal workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-mckinsey-is-using-ai-in-graduate-hiring"&gt;Why McKinsey is using AI in graduate hiring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graduate recruitment is resource-heavy. Every year, large firms receive tens of thousands of applications, many of which must be assessed in short hiring cycles. Screening candidates for basic fit, communication skills, and problem-solving ability can take a long time, even before interviews begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using AI at this stage offers a way to manage volume. A chatbot can interact with every applicant, ask consistent questions and collect organised responses. Human recruiters can then review that data, rather than requiring staff to manually screen every application from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For McKinsey, the chatbot is part of a larger assessment process that includes interviews and human judgment. According to the company, the tool helps in gathering more information early on, rather than making recruiting judgments on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shifting-the-role-of-recruiters"&gt;Shifting the role of recruiters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing AI into recruitment alters how hiring teams operate. Rather than focusing on early screening, recruiters can devote more time to assessing prospects who have already passed initial tests. In theory, that allows for more thoughtful interviews and deeper evaluation later in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it raises questions about oversight. Recruiters need to understand how the chatbot evaluates responses and what signals it prioritises. Without that visibility, there is a risk that decisions could lean too heavily on automated outputs, even if the tool is meant to assist rather than decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional services firms are typically wary about such adjustments. Their reputations rely heavily on talent quality, and any perception of unfair or flawed hiring practices carries risk. As a result, recruitment serves as a testing ground for AI use, as well as an area where controls are important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-concerns-around-fairness-and-bias"&gt;Concerns around fairness and bias&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using AI in hiring is not without controversy. Critics have raised concerns that automated systems can reflect biases present in their training data or in how questions are framed. If not monitored closely, those biases can affect who progresses through the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKinsey has said it is mindful of these risks and that the chatbot is used alongside human review. Still, the move highlights a broader challenge for organisations adopting AI internally: tools must be tested, audited, and adjusted over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recruitment, that includes checking whether certain groups are disadvantaged by how questions are asked or how responses are interpreted. It also means giving candidates clear information about how AI is used and how their data is handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-mckinsey-s-ai-hiring-move-fits-a-wider-enterprise-trend"&gt;How McKinsey’s AI hiring move fits a wider enterprise trend&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of AI in graduate hiring is not unique to consulting. Large employers in finance, law, and technology are also testing AI tools for screening, scheduling interviews, and analysing written responses. What stands out is how quickly these tools are moving from experiments to real processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, AI enters organisations through small, contained use cases. Hiring is one of them. It sits inside the company, affects internal efficiency, and can be adjusted without changing products or services offered to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern mirrors how AI adoption is unfolding more broadly. Instead of sweeping transformations, many firms are adding AI to specific workflows where the benefits and risks are easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-signals-for-enterprises"&gt;What this signals for enterprises&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKinsey’s use of an AI chatbot in recruitment points to a practical shift in enterprise thinking. AI is becoming a tool for routine internal decisions, not just analysis or automation behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other organisations, the lesson is less about copying the tool and more about approach. Introducing AI into sensitive areas like hiring requires clear boundaries, human oversight, and a willingness to review outcomes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also requires communication. Candidates need to know when they are interacting with AI and how that interaction fits into the overall hiring process. Transparency helps build trust, especially as AI becomes more common in workplace decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As professional services firms continue to test AI in their own operations, recruitment offers an early view of how far they are willing to go. The technology may help manage scale and consistency, but responsibility for decisions still rests with people. How well companies balance those two will shape how AI is accepted inside the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Resume Genius)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Allister Frost: Tackling workforce anxiety for AI integration success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111234" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-4.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check outAI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

I know it’s a bit late to say, but it never quite feels like the year has started until the new edition of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list comes out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For 25 years, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium-ion batteries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next-generation nuclear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyperscale data centers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under the new policy, the company is providing a 90-day grace period starting January 15 to developers and AI providers, mandating them to cease responding to user queries on the chat app, and notify users that their chatbots won’t work on WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, Meta told developers that they don’t have to notify users with Brazilian phone numbers (with code +55) of any changes or cease offering their services, per a notice to AI providers seen by TechCrunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The requirement to cease responding to user queries and implement pre-approved auto-reply language (mentioned below) before January 15, 2026, no longer applies when messaging people with a Brazil country code (+55),” the notice reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a query seeking to confirm the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The policy, which goes into effect from today, impacts general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT and Grok on the platform. Notably, the policy does not stop businesses from providing customer service via bots within WhatsApp to their customers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its notice, Brazil’s competition agency said it would investigate if Meta’s terms are exclusionary to competitors and unduly favor Meta AI, the company’s chatbot that’s offered on WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta has previously provided a similar exemption to users in Italy after the country’s competition agency took issue with the policy in December. Separately, the EU has also opened an antitrust investigation into the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has consistently maintained that AI chatbots are straining its systems that were designed for different uses of its business API. Meta has even said in the past that people who want to use different chatbots can do so outside WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“These claims are fundamentally flawed,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in response to CADE’s probe on Tuesday. “The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. This logic assumes WhatsApp is somehow a de facto app store. The route to market for AI companies is the app stores themselves, their websites and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform.” &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Green-white-apple-logo.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;WhatsApp is allowing AI providers to continue offering their chatbots to users with Brazilian phone numbers, days after the country’s competition regulator ordered the company to suspend its new policy that bars third-party, general-purpose chatbots from being offered on the app via its business API.&lt;/p&gt;
