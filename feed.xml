With his showbiz style and fundraising glitz, CEO Sam Altman overshadows all other big names on the firm’s roster. Even his bungled ouster ended with him back on top—and more famous than ever. But look past the charismatic frontman and you get a clearer sense of where this company is going. After all, Altman is not the one building the technology on which its reputation rests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That responsibility falls to OpenAI’s twin heads of research—chief research officer Mark Chen and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki. Between them, they share the role of making sure OpenAI stays one step ahead of powerhouse rivals like Google.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sat down with Chen and Pachocki for an exclusive conversation during a recent trip the pair made to London, where OpenAI set up its first international office in 2023. We talked about how they manage the inherent tension between research and product. We also talked about why they think coding and math are the keys to more capable all-purpose models; what they really mean when they talk about AGI; and what happened to OpenAI’s superalignment team, set up by the firm’s cofounder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever to prevent a hypothetical superintelligence from going rogue, which disbanded soon after he quit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In particular, I wanted to get a sense of where their heads are at in the run-up to OpenAI’s biggest product release in months: GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Reports are out that the firm’s next-generation model will be launched in August. OpenAI’s official line—well, Altman’s—is that it will release GPT-5 “soon.” Anticipation is high. The leaps OpenAI made with GPT-3 and then GPT-4 raised the bar of what was thought possible with this technology. And yet delays to the launch of GPT-5 have fueled rumors that OpenAI has struggled to build a model that meets its own—not to mention everyone else’s—expectations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But expectation management is part of the job for a company that for the last several years has set the agenda for the industry. And Chen and Pachocki set the agenda inside OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twin peaks&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The firm’s main London office is in St James’s Park, a few hundred meters east of Buckingham Palace. But I met Chen and Pachocki in a conference room in a coworking space near King’s Cross, which OpenAI keeps as a kind of pied-à-terre in the heart of London’s tech neighborhood (Google DeepMind and Meta are just around the corner). OpenAI’s head of research communications, Laurance Fauconnet, sat with an open laptop at the end of the table.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chen, who was wearing a maroon polo shirt, is clean-cut, almost preppy. He’s media trained and comfortable talking to a reporter. (That’s him flirting with a chatbot in the “Introducing GPT-4o” video.) Pachocki, in a black elephant-logo tee, has more of a TV-movie hacker look. He stares at his hands a lot when he speaks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the pair are a tighter double act than they first appear. Pachocki summed up their roles. Chen shapes and manages the research teams, he said. “I am responsible for setting the research roadmap and establishing our long-term technical vision.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But there’s fluidity in the roles,” Chen said. “We’re both researchers, we pull on technical threads. Whatever we see that we can pull on and fix, that’s what we do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chen joined the company in 2018 after working as a quantitative trader at the Wall Street firm Jane Street Capital, where he developed machine-learning models for futures trading. At OpenAI he spearheaded the creation of DALL-E, the firm’s breakthrough generative image model. He then worked on adding image recognition to GPT‑4 and led the development of Codex, the generative coding model that powers GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pachocki left an academic career in theoretical computer science to join OpenAI in 2017 and replaced Sutskever as chief scientist in 2024. He is the key architect of OpenAI’s so-called reasoning models—especially o1 and o3—which are designed to tackle complex tasks in science, math, and coding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we met they were buzzing, fresh off the high of two new back-to-back wins for their company’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On July 16, one of OpenAI’s large language models came in second in the AtCoder World Tour Finals, one of the world’s most hardcore programming competitions. On July 19, OpenAI announced that one of its models had achieved gold-medal-level results on the 2025 International Math Olympiad, one of the world’s most prestigious math contests.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The math result made headlines, not only because of OpenAI’s remarkable achievement, but because rival Google DeepMind revealed two days later that one of its models had achieved the same score in the same competition. Google DeepMind had played by the competition’s rules and waited for its results to be checked by the organizers before making an announcement; OpenAI had in effect marked its own answers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Chen and Pachocki, the result speaks for itself. Anyway, it’s the programming win they’re most excited about. “I think that’s quite underrated,” Chen told me. A gold medal result in the International Math Olympiad puts you somewhere in the top 20 to 50 competitors, he said. But in the AtCoder contest OpenAI’s model placed in the top two: “To break into a really different tier of human performance—that’s unprecedented.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship, ship, ship!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People at OpenAI still like to say they work at a research lab. But the company is very different from the one it was before the release of ChatGPT three years ago. The firm is now in a race with the biggest and richest technology companies in the world and valued at $300 billion. Envelope-pushing research and eye-catching demos no longer cut it. It needs to ship products and get them into people’s hands—and boy, it does.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI has kept up a run of new releases—putting out major updates to its GPT-4 series, launching a string of generative image and video models, and introducing the ability to talk to ChatGPT with your voice. Six months ago it kicked off a new wave of so-called reasoning models with its o1 release, soon followed by o3. And last week it released its browser-using agent Operator to the public. It now claims that more than 400 million people use its products every week and submit 2.5 billion prompts a day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s incoming CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, plans to keep up the momentum. In a memo to the company, she told employees she is looking forward to “helping get OpenAI’s technologies into the hands of more people around the world,” where they will “unlock more opportunities for more people than any other technology in history.” Expect the products to keep coming.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked how OpenAI juggles open-ended research and product development. “This is something we have been thinking about for a very long time, long before ChatGPT,” Pachocki said. “If we are actually serious about trying to build artificial general intelligence, clearly there will be so much that you can do with this technology along the way, so many tangents you can go down that will be big products.” In other words, keep shaking the tree and harvest what you can.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A talking point that comes up with OpenAI folks is that putting experimental models out into the world was a necessary part of research. The goal was to make people aware of how good this technology had become. “We want to educate people about what’s coming so that we can participate in what will be a very hard societal conversation,” Altman told me back in 2022. The makers of this strange new technology were also curious what it might be for: OpenAI was keen to get it into people’s hands to see what they would do with it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Is that still the case? They answered at the same time. “Yeah!” Chen said. “To some extent,” Pachocki said. Chen laughed: “No, go ahead.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t say research iterates on product,” said Pachocki. “But now that models are at the edge of the capabilities that can be measured by classical benchmarks and a lot of the long-standing challenges that we’ve been thinking about are starting to fall, we’re at the point where it really is about what the models can do in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like taking on humans in coding competitions. The person who beat OpenAI’s model at this year’s AtCoder contest, held in Japan, was a programmer named Przemysław Dębiak, also known as Psyho. The contest was a puzzle-solving marathon in which competitors had 10 hours to find the most efficient way to solve a complex coding problem. After his win, Psyho posted on X: “I’m completely exhausted ... I’m barely alive.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Chen and Pachocki have strong ties to the world of competitive coding. Both have competed in international coding contests in the past and Chen coaches the USA Computing Olympiad team. I asked whether that personal enthusiasm for competitive coding colors their sense of how big a deal it is for a model to perform well at such a challenge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;They both laughed. “Definitely,” said Pachocki. “So: Psyho is kind of a legend. He’s been the number one competitor for many years. He’s also actually a friend of mine—we used to compete together in these contests.” Dębiak also used to work with Pachocki at OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Pachocki competed in coding contests he favored those that focused on shorter problems with concrete solutions. But Dębiak liked longer, open-ended problems without an obvious correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“He used to poke fun at me, saying that the kind of contest I was into will be automated long before the ones he liked,” Pachocki recalled. “So I was seriously invested in the performance of this model in this latest competition.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pachocki told me he was glued to the late-night livestream from Tokyo, watching his model come in second: “Psyho resists for now.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’ve tracked the performance of LLMs on coding contests for a while,” said Chen. “We’ve watched them become better than me, better than Jakub. It feels something like Lee Sedol playing Go.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Lee is the master Go player who lost a series of matches to DeepMind’s game-playing model AlphaGo in 2016. The results stunned the international Go community and led Lee to give up professional play. Last year he told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;: “Losing to AI, in a sense, meant my entire world was collapsing ... I could no longer enjoy the game.” And yet, unlike Lee, Chen and Pachocki are thrilled to be surpassed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But why should the rest of us care about these niche wins? It’s clear that this technology—designed to mimic and, ultimately, stand in for human intelligence—is being built by people whose idea of peak intelligence is acing a math contest or holding your own against a legendary coder. Is it a problem that this view of intelligence is skewed toward the mathematical, analytical end of the scale?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I mean, I think you are right that—you know, selfishly, we do want to create models which accelerate ourselves,” Chen told me. “We see that as a very fast factor to progress.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The argument researchers like Chen and Pachocki make is that math and coding are the bedrock for a far more general form of intelligence, one that can solve a wide range of problems in ways we might not have thought of ourselves. “We’re talking about programming and math here,” said Pachocki. “But it’s really about creativity, coming up with novel ideas, connecting ideas from different places.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at the two recent competitions: “In both cases, there were problems which required very hard, out-of-the-box thinking. Psyho spent half the programming competition thinking and then came up with a solution that was really novel and quite different from anything that our model looked at.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This is really what we’re after,” Pachocki continued. “How do we get models to discover this sort of novel insight? To actually advance our knowledge? I think they are already capable of that in some limited ways. But I think this technology has the potential to really accelerate scientific progress.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I returned to the question about whether the focus on math and programming was a problem, conceding that maybe it’s fine if what we’re building are tools to help us do science. We don't necessarily want large language models to replace politicians and have people skills, I suggested.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chen pulled a face and looked up at the ceiling:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Why not?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s missing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI was founded with a level of hubris that stood out even by Silicon Valley standards, boasting about its goal of building AGI back when talk of AGI still sounded kooky. OpenAI remains as gung-ho about AGI as ever, and it has done more than most to make AGI a mainstream multibillion-dollar concern. It’s not there yet, though. I asked Chen and Pachocki what they think is missing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I think the way to envision the future is to really, deeply study the technology that we see today,” Pachocki said. “From the beginning, OpenAI has looked at deep learning as this very mysterious and clearly very powerful technology with a lot of potential. We’ve been trying to understand its bottlenecks. What can it do? What can it not do?”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the current cutting edge, Chen said, are reasoning models, which break down problems into smaller, more manageable steps, but even they have limits: “You know, you have these models which know a lot of things but can’t chain that knowledge together. Why is that? Why can’t it do that in a way that humans can?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is throwing everything at answering that question.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are probably still, like, at the very beginning of this reasoning paradigm,” Pachocki told me. “Really, we are thinking about how to get these models to learn and explore over the long term and actually deliver very new ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chen pushed the point home: “I really don’t consider reasoning done. We’ve definitely not solved it. You have to read so much text to get a kind of approximation of what humans know.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI won’t say what data it uses to train its models or give details about their size and shape—only that it is working hard to make all stages of the development process more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those efforts make them confident that so-called scaling laws—which suggest that models will continue to get better the more compute you throw at them—show no sign of breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s evidence that scaling laws are dead in any sense,” Chen insisted. “There have always been bottlenecks, right? Sometimes they’re to do with the way models are built. Sometimes they’re to do with data. But fundamentally it’s just about finding the research that breaks you through the current bottleneck.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The faith in progress is unshakeable. I brought up something Pachocki had said about AGI in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in May: “When I joined OpenAI in 2017, I was still among the biggest skeptics at the company.” He looked doubtful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure I was skeptical about the concept,” he said. “But I think I was—” He paused, looking at his hands on the table in front of him. “When I joined OpenAI, I expected the timelines to be longer to get to the point that we are now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of consequences of AI,” he said. “But the one I think the most about is automated research. When we look at human history, a lot of it is about technological progress, about humans building new technologies. The point when computers can develop new technologies themselves seems like a very important, um, inflection point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We already see these models assist scientists. But when they are able to work on longer horizons—when they’re able to establish research programs for themselves—the world will feel meaningfully different.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Chen, that ability for models to work by themselves for longer is key. “I mean, I do think everyone has their own definitions of AGI,” he said. “But this concept of autonomous time—just the amount of time that the model can spend making productive progress on a difficult problem without hitting a dead end—that’s one of the big things that we’re after.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a bold vision—and far beyond the capabilities of today’s models. But I was nevertheless struck by how Chen and Pachocki made AGI sound almost mundane. Compare this with how Sutskever responded when I spoke to him 18 months ago. “It’s going to be monumental, earth-shattering,” he told me. “There will be a before and an after.” Faced with the immensity of what he was building, Sutskever switched the focus of his career from designing better and better models to figuring out how to control a technology that he believed would soon be smarter than himself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two years ago Sutskever set up what he called a superalignment team that he would co-lead with another OpenAI safety researcher, Jan Leike. The claim was that this team would funnel a full fifth of OpenAI’s resources into figuring out how to control a hypothetical superintelligence. Today, most of the people on the superalignment team, including Sutskever and Leike, have left the company and the team no longer exists.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Leike quit, he said it was because the team had not been given the support he felt it deserved. He posted this on X: “Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor. OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity. But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.” Other departing researchers shared similar statements.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked Chen and Pachocki what they make of such concerns. “A lot of these things are highly personal decisions,” Chen said. “You know, a researcher can kind of, you know—”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He started again. “They might have a belief that the field is going to evolve in a certain way and that their research is going to pan out and is going to bear fruit. And, you know, maybe the company doesn’t reshape in the way that you want it to. It’s a very dynamic field.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A lot of these things are personal decisions,” he repeated. “Sometimes the field is just evolving in a way that is less consistent with the way that you’re doing research.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But alignment, both of them insist, is now part of the core business rather than the concern of one specific team. According to Pachocki, these models don’t work at all unless they work as you expect them to. There’s also little desire to focus on aligning a hypothetical superintelligence with your objectives when doing so with existing models is already enough of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Two years ago the risks that we were imagining were mostly theoretical risks,” Pachocki said. “The world today looks very different, and I think a lot of alignment problems are now very practically motivated.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, experimental technology is being spun into mass-market products faster than ever before. Does that really never lead to disagreements between the two of them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;I am often afforded the luxury of really kind of thinking about the long term, where the technology is headed,” Pachocki said. “Contending with the reality of the process—both in terms of people and also, like, the broader company needs—falls on Mark. It’s not really a disagreement, but there is a natural tension between these different objectives and the different challenges that the company is facing that materializes between us.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chen jumped in: “I think it’s just a very delicate balance.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: we have removed a line referring to an Altman message on X about GPT-5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250724-AI-hero.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the past couple of years, OpenAI has felt like a one-man brand. With his showbiz style and fundraising glitz, CEO Sam Altman overshadows all other big names on the firm’s roster. Even his bungled ouster ended with him back on top—and more famous than ever. But look past the charismatic frontman and you get a clearer sense of where this company is going. After all, Altman is not the one building the technology on which its reputation rests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That responsibility falls to OpenAI’s twin heads of research—chief research officer Mark Chen and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki. Between them, they share the role of making sure OpenAI stays one step ahead of powerhouse rivals like Google.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sat down with Chen and Pachocki for an exclusive conversation during a recent trip the pair made to London, where OpenAI set up its first international office in 2023. We talked about how they manage the inherent tension between research and product. We also talked about why they think coding and math are the keys to more capable all-purpose models; what they really mean when they talk about AGI; and what happened to OpenAI’s superalignment team, set up by the firm’s cofounder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever to prevent a hypothetical superintelligence from going rogue, which disbanded soon after he quit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In particular, I wanted to get a sense of where their heads are at in the run-up to OpenAI’s biggest product release in months: GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Reports are out that the firm’s next-generation model will be launched in August. OpenAI’s official line—well, Altman’s—is that it will release GPT-5 “soon.” Anticipation is high. The leaps OpenAI made with GPT-3 and then GPT-4 raised the bar of what was thought possible with this technology.

And Chen and Pachocki set the agenda inside OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twin peaks&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The firm’s main London office is in St James’s Park, a few hundred meters east of Buckingham Palace. But I met Chen and Pachocki in a conference room in a coworking space near King’s Cross, which OpenAI keeps as a kind of pied-à-terre in the heart of London’s tech neighborhood (Google DeepMind and Meta are just around the corner). OpenAI’s head of research communications, Laurance Fauconnet, sat with an open laptop at the end of the table.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chen, who was wearing a maroon polo shirt, is clean-cut, almost preppy. He’s media trained and comfortable talking to a reporter. (That’s him flirting with a chatbot in the “Introducing GPT-4o” video.) Pachocki, in a black elephant-logo tee, has more of a TV-movie hacker look. He stares at his hands a lot when he speaks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the pair are a tighter double act than they first appear. Pachocki summed up their roles. Chen shapes and manages the research teams, he said. “I am responsible for setting the research roadmap and establishing our long-term technical vision.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But there’s fluidity in the roles,” Chen said. “We’re both researchers, we pull on technical threads. Whatever we see that we can pull on and fix, that’s what we do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chen joined the company in 2018 after working as a quantitative trader at the Wall Street firm Jane Street Capital, where he developed machine-learning models for futures trading. At OpenAI he spearheaded the creation of DALL-E, the firm’s breakthrough generative image model. He then worked on adding image recognition to GPT‑4 and led the development of Codex, the generative coding model that powers GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pachocki left an academic career in theoretical computer science to join OpenAI in 2017 and replaced Sutskever as chief scientist in 2024. He is the key architect of OpenAI’s so-called reasoning models—especially o1 and o3—which are designed to tackle complex tasks in science, math, and coding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we met they were buzzing, fresh off the high of two new back-to-back wins for their company’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On July 16, one of OpenAI’s large language models came in second in the AtCoder World Tour Finals, one of the world’s most hardcore programming competitions. On July 19, OpenAI announced that one of its models had achieved gold-medal-level results on the 2025 International Math Olympiad, one of the world’s most prestigious math contests.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The math result made headlines, not only because of OpenAI’s remarkable achievement, but because rival Google DeepMind revealed two days later that one of its models had achieved the same score in the same competition. Google DeepMind had played by the competition’s rules and waited for its results to be checked by the organizers before making an announcement; OpenAI had in effect marked its own answers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Chen and Pachocki, the result speaks for itself. Anyway, it’s the programming win they’re most excited about. “I think that’s quite underrated,” Chen told me. A gold medal result in the International Math Olympiad puts you somewhere in the top 20 to 50 competitors, he said. But in the AtCoder contest OpenAI’s model placed in the top two: “To break into a really different tier of human performance—that’s unprecedented.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship, ship, ship!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People at OpenAI still like to say they work at a research lab. But the company is very different from the one it was before the release of ChatGPT three years ago. The firm is now in a race with the biggest and richest technology companies in the world and valued at $300 billion. Envelope-pushing research and eye-catching demos no longer cut it. It needs to ship products and get them into people’s hands—and boy, it does.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI has kept up a run of new releases—putting out major updates to its GPT-4 series, launching a string of generative image and video models, and introducing the ability to talk to ChatGPT with your voice. Six months ago it kicked off a new wave of so-called reasoning models with its o1 release, soon followed by o3. And last week it released its browser-using agent Operator to the public. It now claims that more than 400 million people use its products every week and submit 2.5 billion prompts a day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s incoming CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, plans to keep up the momentum. In a memo to the company, she told employees she is looking forward to “helping get OpenAI’s technologies into the hands of more people around the world,” where they will “unlock more opportunities for more people than any other technology in history.” Expect the products to keep coming.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked how OpenAI juggles open-ended research and product development. “This is something we have been thinking about for a very long time, long before ChatGPT,” Pachocki said. “If we are actually serious about trying to build artificial general intelligence, clearly there will be so much that you can do with this technology along the way, so many tangents you can go down that will be big products.” In other words, keep shaking the tree and harvest what you can.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A talking point that comes up with OpenAI folks is that putting experimental models out into the world was a necessary part of research. The goal was to make people aware of how good this technology had become. “We want to educate people about what’s coming so that we can participate in what will be a very hard societal conversation,” Altman told me back in 2022. The makers of this strange new technology were also curious what it might be for: OpenAI was keen to get it into people’s hands to see what they would do with it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Is that still the case? They answered at the same time. “Yeah!” Chen said. “To some extent,” Pachocki said. Chen laughed: “No, go ahead.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t say research iterates on product,” said Pachocki. “But now that models are at the edge of the capabilities that can be measured by classical benchmarks and a lot of the long-standing challenges that we’ve been thinking about are starting to fall, we’re at the point where it really is about what the models can do in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like taking on humans in coding competitions. The person who beat OpenAI’s model at this year’s AtCoder contest, held in Japan, was a programmer named Przemysław Dębiak, also known as Psyho. The contest was a puzzle-solving marathon in which competitors had 10 hours to find the most efficient way to solve a complex coding problem. After his win, Psyho posted on X: “I’m completely exhausted ... I’m barely alive.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Chen and Pachocki have strong ties to the world of competitive coding. Both have competed in international coding contests in the past and Chen coaches the USA Computing Olympiad team. I asked whether that personal enthusiasm for competitive coding colors their sense of how big a deal it is for a model to perform well at such a challenge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;They both laughed. “Definitely,” said Pachocki. “So: Psyho is kind of a legend. He’s been the number one competitor for many years. He’s also actually a friend of mine—we used to compete together in these contests.” Dębiak also used to work with Pachocki at OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Pachocki competed in coding contests he favored those that focused on shorter problems with concrete solutions. But Dębiak liked longer, open-ended problems without an obvious correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“He used to poke fun at me, saying that the kind of contest I was into will be automated long before the ones he liked,” Pachocki recalled. “So I was seriously invested in the performance of this model in this latest competition.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pachocki told me he was glued to the late-night livestream from Tokyo, watching his model come in second: “Psyho resists for now.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’ve tracked the performance of LLMs on coding contests for a while,” said Chen. “We’ve watched them become better than me, better than Jakub. It feels something like Lee Sedol playing Go.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Lee is the master Go player who lost a series of matches to DeepMind’s game-playing model AlphaGo in 2016. The results stunned the international Go community and led Lee to give up professional play. Last year he told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;: “Losing to AI, in a sense, meant my entire world was collapsing ... I could no longer enjoy the game.” And yet, unlike Lee, Chen and Pachocki are thrilled to be surpassed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But why should the rest of us care about these niche wins? It’s clear that this technology—designed to mimic and, ultimately, stand in for human intelligence—is being built by people whose idea of peak intelligence is acing a math contest or holding your own against a legendary coder. Is it a problem that this view of intelligence is skewed toward the mathematical, analytical end of the scale?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I mean, I think you are right that—you know, selfishly, we do want to create models which accelerate ourselves,” Chen told me. “We see that as a very fast factor to progress.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The argument researchers like Chen and Pachocki make is that math and coding are the bedrock for a far more general form of intelligence, one that can solve a wide range of problems in ways we might not have thought of ourselves. “We’re talking about programming and math here,” said Pachocki. “But it’s really about creativity, coming up with novel ideas, connecting ideas from different places.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at the two recent competitions: “In both cases, there were problems which required very hard, out-of-the-box thinking. Psyho spent half the programming competition thinking and then came up with a solution that was really novel and quite different from anything that our model looked at.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This is really what we’re after,” Pachocki continued. “How do we get models to discover this sort of novel insight? To actually advance our knowledge? I think they are already capable of that in some limited ways. But I think this technology has the potential to really accelerate scientific progress.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I returned to the question about whether the focus on math and programming was a problem, conceding that maybe it’s fine if what we’re building are tools to help us do science. We don't necessarily want large language models to replace politicians and have people skills, I suggested.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chen pulled a face and looked up at the ceiling:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Why not?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s missing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI was founded with a level of hubris that stood out even by Silicon Valley standards, boasting about its goal of building AGI back when talk of AGI still sounded kooky. OpenAI remains as gung-ho about AGI as ever, and it has done more than most to make AGI a mainstream multibillion-dollar concern. It’s not there yet, though. I asked Chen and Pachocki what they think is missing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I think the way to envision the future is to really, deeply study the technology that we see today,” Pachocki said. “From the beginning, OpenAI has looked at deep learning as this very mysterious and clearly very powerful technology with a lot of potential. We’ve been trying to understand its bottlenecks. What can it do? What can it not do?”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the current cutting edge, Chen said, are reasoning models, which break down problems into smaller, more manageable steps, but even they have limits: “You know, you have these models which know a lot of things but can’t chain that knowledge together. Why is that? Why can’t it do that in a way that humans can?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is throwing everything at answering that question.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are probably still, like, at the very beginning of this reasoning paradigm,” Pachocki told me. “Really, we are thinking about how to get these models to learn and explore over the long term and actually deliver very new ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chen pushed the point home: “I really don’t consider reasoning done. We’ve definitely not solved it. You have to read so much text to get a kind of approximation of what humans know.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI won’t say what data it uses to train its models or give details about their size and shape—only that it is working hard to make all stages of the development process more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those efforts make them confident that so-called scaling laws—which suggest that models will continue to get better the more compute you throw at them—show no sign of breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s evidence that scaling laws are dead in any sense,” Chen insisted. “There have always been bottlenecks, right? Sometimes they’re to do with the way models are built. Sometimes they’re to do with data. But fundamentally it’s just about finding the research that breaks you through the current bottleneck.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The faith in progress is unshakeable. I brought up something Pachocki had said about AGI in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in May: “When I joined OpenAI in 2017, I was still among the biggest skeptics at the company.” He looked doubtful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure I was skeptical about the concept,” he said. “But I think I was—” He paused, looking at his hands on the table in front of him. “When I joined OpenAI, I expected the timelines to be longer to get to the point that we are now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of consequences of AI,” he said. “But the one I think the most about is automated research. When we look at human history, a lot of it is about technological progress, about humans building new technologies. The point when computers can develop new technologies themselves seems like a very important, um, inflection point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We already see these models assist scientists. But when they are able to work on longer horizons—when they’re able to establish research programs for themselves—the world will feel meaningfully different.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Chen, that ability for models to work by themselves for longer is key. “I mean, I do think everyone has their own definitions of AGI,” he said. “But this concept of autonomous time—just the amount of time that the model can spend making productive progress on a difficult problem without hitting a dead end—that’s one of the big things that we’re after.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a bold vision—and far beyond the capabilities of today’s models. But I was nevertheless struck by how Chen and Pachocki made AGI sound almost mundane. Compare this with how Sutskever responded when I spoke to him 18 months ago. “It’s going to be monumental, earth-shattering,” he told me. “There will be a before and an after.” Faced with the immensity of what he was building, Sutskever switched the focus of his career from designing better and better models to figuring out how to control a technology that he believed would soon be smarter than himself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two years ago Sutskever set up what he called a superalignment team that he would co-lead with another OpenAI safety researcher, Jan Leike. The claim was that this team would funnel a full fifth of OpenAI’s resources into figuring out how to control a hypothetical superintelligence. Today, most of the people on the superalignment team, including Sutskever and Leike, have left the company and the team no longer exists.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Leike quit, he said it was because the team had not been given the support he felt it deserved. He posted this on X: “Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor. OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity. But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.” Other departing researchers shared similar statements.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked Chen and Pachocki what they make of such concerns. “A lot of these things are highly personal decisions,” Chen said. “You know, a researcher can kind of, you know—”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He started again. “They might have a belief that the field is going to evolve in a certain way and that their research is going to pan out and is going to bear fruit. And, you know, maybe the company doesn’t reshape in the way that you want it to. It’s a very dynamic field.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A lot of these things are personal decisions,” he repeated. “Sometimes the field is just evolving in a way that is less consistent with the way that you’re doing research.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But alignment, both of them insist, is now part of the core business rather than the concern of one specific team. According to Pachocki, these models don’t work at all unless they work as you expect them to. There’s also little desire to focus on aligning a hypothetical superintelligence with your objectives when doing so with existing models is already enough of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Two years ago the risks that we were imagining were mostly theoretical risks,” Pachocki said. “The world today looks very different, and I think a lot of alignment problems are now very practically motivated.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, experimental technology is being spun into mass-market products faster than ever before. Does that really never lead to disagreements between the two of them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;I am often afforded the luxury of really kind of thinking about the long term, where the technology is headed,” Pachocki said. “Contending with the reality of the process—both in terms of people and also, like, the broader company needs—falls on Mark. It’s not really a disagreement, but there is a natural tension between these different objectives and the different challenges that the company is facing that materializes between us.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chen jumped in: “I think it’s just a very delicate balance.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: we have removed a line referring to an Altman message on X about GPT-5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/31/1120885/the-two-people-shaping-the-future-of-openais-research/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 09:06:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Download: OpenAI’s future research, and US climate regulation is under threat (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/31/1120890/the-download-openais-future-research-and-us-climate-regulation-is-under-threat/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is today's edition of&amp;nbsp;The Download&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The two people shaping the future of OpenAI’s research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Will Douglas Heaven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of years, OpenAI has felt like a one-man brand. With his showbiz style and fundraising glitz, CEO Sam Altman overshadows all other big names on the firm’s roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Altman is not the one building the technology on which its reputation rests. That responsibility falls to OpenAI’s twin heads of research—chief research officer Mark Chen and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki. Between them, they share the role of making sure OpenAI stays one step ahead of powerhouse rivals like Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently sat down with Chen and Pachocki for an exclusive conversation which covered everything from how they manage the inherent tension between research and product, to what they really mean when they talk about AGI, to what happened to OpenAI’s superalignment team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I also wanted to get a sense of where their heads are at in the run-up to OpenAI’s biggest product release in months: GPT-5.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt; 
   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An EPA rule change threatens to gut US climate regulations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The mechanism that allows the US federal government to regulate climate change is on the chopping block.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, US Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency is taking aim at the endangerment finding, a 2009 rule that’s essentially the tentpole supporting federal greenhouse-gas regulations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This might sound like an obscure legal situation, but it’s a really big deal for climate policy in the US.

With cyber threats emerging and regulatory requirements becoming increasingly stringent, organisations can’t afford to rely on manual compliance monitoring approaches. The advent of artificial intelligence has transformed the challenge, offering capabilities for continuous oversight and real-time protection of sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-evolution-of-compliance-monitoring"&gt;The evolution of compliance monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional compliance monitoring is characterised by annual assessments and reactive responses to incidents. While this approach is sufficient for simpler regulatory environments, it falls short in addressing the complexities of modern data protection. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018, and emerging frameworks like the Digital Services Act demand compliance and demonstrable, ongoing adherence to data handling protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift to continuous monitoring represents a change in how organisations approach compliance. Rather than periodic snapshots of compliance status, businesses are better off with real-time visibility in their security posture. The transformation has been driven by several factors: the increasing volume and velocity of data processing, the sophistication of cyber threats, and the evolution of regulatory expectations towards proactive rather than reactive compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-powered-continuous-monitoring-capabilities"&gt;AI-powered continuous monitoring capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence brings several advantages to compliance monitoring that human-led processes cannot match. Machine learning algorithms can process vast quantities of data in real-time, identifying patterns and anomalies that would be difficult for human analysts to detect manually. Systems can simultaneously monitor multiple data streams, user activities, and system behaviours in all of an organisation’s digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-powered monitoring systems excel at pattern recognition, learning from historical data to establish baselines of normal behaviour. When deviations occur – whether through unauthorised access attempts, unusual data transfers, or policy violations – they can immediately flag potential compliance breaches. The capability extends beyond simple rule-based detection; AI systems can identify subtle indicators that may suggest emerging compliance risks before they transform into actual violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI systems can contextualise compliance events in broader organisational and regulatory frameworks. Rather than generating isolated alerts, intelligent monitoring platforms can assess the significance of events based on factors like data sensitivity, user roles, regulatory requirements, and potential business impact. Contextual awareness enables more targeted and effective compliance responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-time-threat-detection-and-response"&gt;Real-time threat detection and response&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed of AI-powered monitoring represents perhaps its most significant advantage over traditional approaches. While manual compliance reviews might detect violations up to days or weeks after they occur, AI systems can identify and respond to potential breaches in seconds or minutes. This rapid response capability is important to minimise the impact of data protection incidents and ensure swift remediation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-time monitoring lets organisations implement dynamic compliance controls that adapt to changing circumstances. For instance, if AI systems detect unusual data access patterns that suggest potential unauthorised activity, they can trigger additional authentication requirements or temporarily restrict access to sensitive resources. A proactive approach can prevent compliance violations before they occur, rather than documenting them after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration of AI with automated response mechanisms further enhances protection capabilities. When potential violations are detected, systems can automatically initiate predefined response protocols, like isolating affected systems, notifying relevant personnel, or implementing emergency access controls. Automation helps ensure consistent and timely responses, regardless of when incidents occur or whether human operators are immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comprehensive-coverage-across-digital-assets"&gt;Comprehensive coverage across digital assets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern organisations operate complex digital ecosystems that span cloud services, on-premises infrastructure, mobile devices, and third-party applications. AI-powered compliance monitoring can provide unified oversight in diverse environments, helping ensure consistent protection standards regardless of where data resides or how it is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud environments, in particular, benefit from AI-driven monitoring. The dynamic nature of cloud infrastructure – with resources being created, modified, and destroyed continuously – makes manual compliance oversight difficult. AI systems can track configuration changes, monitor data flows, and ensure that security controls remain properly configured as environments evolve. This capability is important in maintaining compliance in cloud-centric business operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, AI can monitor compliance in the full data lifecycle, from collection and processing to storage and deletion. By implementing a compliance automation platform like Thoropass, organisations can help ensure that data handling practices are consistent with regulatory requirements throughout each stage of processing. Comprehensive coverage helps organisations maintain demonstrable compliance even as data volumes and processing complexity continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-predictive-analytics-for-compliance-risk-management"&gt;Predictive analytics for compliance risk management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond reactive monitoring, AI can provide predictive analytics that can identify potential compliance risks before they materialise. Analysing historical patterns, user behaviours, and system configurations lets AI systems predict scenarios that may lead to compliance violations. Predictive capability allows organisations to implement preventive measures and address vulnerabilities proactively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictive analytics can also inform compliance strategy and resource allocation, and identifying areas of highest risk and predicting future compliance challenges helps organisations prioritise their security investments and compliance efforts. The strategic application of AI ensures that limited resources are directed towards the most dangerous areas of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regulatory-reporting-and-documentation-benefits"&gt;Regulatory reporting and documentation benefits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-powered monitoring systems perform well at generating comprehensive audit trails and compliance documentation. Systems can automatically collect, correlate, and present evidence of compliance activities in formats suitable for regulatory reporting. Such capability reduces the administrative burden associated with compliance documentation and helps ensure accuracy and completeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated reporting capabilities also enable more frequent and detailed compliance assessments. Rather than waiting for annual audits, organisations can generate real-time compliance reports that provide continuous visibility into their data protection posture. An ongoing assessment capability helps organisations identify and address compliance gaps more quickly, reducing the risk of regulatory violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition to AI-powered compliance monitoring represents a technological upgrade and signifies a shift towards more effective, efficient, and comprehensive data protection. As regulatory requirements evolve and cyber threats become more sophisticated, the ability to maintain continuous oversight of data protection compliance becomes not just advantageous, but essential. Organisations that adopt AI-driven capabilities position themselves to meet current compliance requirements and adapt successfully to tomorrow’s regulatory landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guest author: Sally Giles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Pexels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/pexels-thisisengineering-3862610-scaled.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data protection compliance has evolved from a periodic checklist exercise to a continuous responsibility.

While manual compliance reviews might detect violations up to days or weeks after they occur, AI systems can identify and respond to potential breaches in seconds or minutes. This rapid response capability is important to minimise the impact of data protection incidents and ensure swift remediation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-time monitoring lets organisations implement dynamic compliance controls that adapt to changing circumstances. For instance, if AI systems detect unusual data access patterns that suggest potential unauthorised activity, they can trigger additional authentication requirements or temporarily restrict access to sensitive resources. A proactive approach can prevent compliance violations before they occur, rather than documenting them after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration of AI with automated response mechanisms further enhances protection capabilities. When potential violations are detected, systems can automatically initiate predefined response protocols, like isolating affected systems, notifying relevant personnel, or implementing emergency access controls. Automation helps ensure consistent and timely responses, regardless of when incidents occur or whether human operators are immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comprehensive-coverage-across-digital-assets"&gt;Comprehensive coverage across digital assets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern organisations operate complex digital ecosystems that span cloud services, on-premises infrastructure, mobile devices, and third-party applications. AI-powered compliance monitoring can provide unified oversight in diverse environments, helping ensure consistent protection standards regardless of where data resides or how it is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud environments, in particular, benefit from AI-driven monitoring. The dynamic nature of cloud infrastructure – with resources being created, modified, and destroyed continuously – makes manual compliance oversight difficult. AI systems can track configuration changes, monitor data flows, and ensure that security controls remain properly configured as environments evolve. This capability is important in maintaining compliance in cloud-centric business operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, AI can monitor compliance in the full data lifecycle, from collection and processing to storage and deletion. By implementing a compliance automation platform like Thoropass, organisations can help ensure that data handling practices are consistent with regulatory requirements throughout each stage of processing. Comprehensive coverage helps organisations maintain demonstrable compliance even as data volumes and processing complexity continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-predictive-analytics-for-compliance-risk-management"&gt;Predictive analytics for compliance risk management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond reactive monitoring, AI can provide predictive analytics that can identify potential compliance risks before they materialise. Analysing historical patterns, user behaviours, and system configurations lets AI systems predict scenarios that may lead to compliance violations. Predictive capability allows organisations to implement preventive measures and address vulnerabilities proactively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictive analytics can also inform compliance strategy and resource allocation, and identifying areas of highest risk and predicting future compliance challenges helps organisations prioritise their security investments and compliance efforts. The strategic application of AI ensures that limited resources are directed towards the most dangerous areas of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regulatory-reporting-and-documentation-benefits"&gt;Regulatory reporting and documentation benefits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-powered monitoring systems perform well at generating comprehensive audit trails and compliance documentation. Systems can automatically collect, correlate, and present evidence of compliance activities in formats suitable for regulatory reporting. Such capability reduces the administrative burden associated with compliance documentation and helps ensure accuracy and completeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated reporting capabilities also enable more frequent and detailed compliance assessments. Rather than waiting for annual audits, organisations can generate real-time compliance reports that provide continuous visibility into their data protection posture. An ongoing assessment capability helps organisations identify and address compliance gaps more quickly, reducing the risk of regulatory violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition to AI-powered compliance monitoring represents a technological upgrade and signifies a shift towards more effective, efficient, and comprehensive data protection. As regulatory requirements evolve and cyber threats become more sophisticated, the ability to maintain continuous oversight of data protection compliance becomes not just advantageous, but essential. Organisations that adopt AI-driven capabilities position themselves to meet current compliance requirements and adapt successfully to tomorrow’s regulatory landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guest author: Sally Giles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Pexels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/24-7-compliance-monitoring-the-ai-advantage-in-data-protection/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 12:16:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Informatica advances its AI to transform 7-day enterprise data mapping nightmares into 5-minute coffee breaks (AI News | VentureBeat)</title><link>https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/enterprise-data-fragmentation-isnt-going-away-how-informatica-has-evolved-its-ai-capabilities-to-solve-real-challenges/</link><description>&lt;div id="boilerplate_2682874"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data platform vendor Informatica is expanding its AI capabilities as the needs of gen AI continue to increase enterprise requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Informatica is no stranger to the world of AI; in fact, the company debuted its first Claire AI tool for data in 2018. In the modern generative &lt;span&gt;AI era, the&lt;/span&gt; company has expanded its technology with improved natural language capabilities in&amp;nbsp;Claire GPT,&amp;nbsp;as part of Informatica’s Intelligent Data Management Cloud (IDMC), which debuted in 2023. The fundamental premise is all about making it easier, faster and more intelligent to access and use data. It’s a value proposition that has made the company an attractive acquisition target, with Salesforce announcing in May that it intends to acquire the company for $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that acquisition proceeds through approvals and regulatory processes, enterprises still face data challenges that need to be addressed. Today, Informatica announced its Summer 2025 release, showcasing how the company’s AI journey over the past seven years has evolved to address enterprise data needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update introduces natural language interfaces that can build complex data pipelines from simple English commands, AI-powered governance that automatically tracks data lineage to machine learning models and auto-mapping capabilities that compress week-long schema mapping projects into minutes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AI Impact Series Returns to San Francisco - August 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next phase of AI is here - are you ready? Join leaders from Block, GSK, and SAP for an exclusive look at how autonomous agents are reshaping enterprise workflows - from real-time decision-making to end-to-end automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release addresses a persistent enterprise data challenge that generative AI has made more urgent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The thing that has not changed is the data continues to be fragmented in the enterprise and that fragmentation is still at a rapid scale, it’s not converging whatsoever,” Pratik Parekh, SVP and GM of Cloud Integration at Informatica told VentureBeat.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“So that means that you have to bring all of this data together.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-machine-learning-to-gen-ai-for-enterprise-data"&gt;From machine learning to gen AI for enterprise data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To better understand what Informatica is doing now, it’s critical to understand how it has gotten to this point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informatica’s initial Claire implementation in 2018 focused on practical machine learning (ML) problems that plagued enterprise data teams. The platform used accumulated metadata from thousands of customer implementations to provide design-time recommendations, runtime optimizations and operational insights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The foundation was built on what Parekh calls a “metadata system of intelligence” containing 40 petabytes of enterprise data patterns. This wasn’t abstract research, but instead applied machine learning that addressed specific bottlenecks in data integration workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That metadata system of intelligence has continued to improve over the years, and in the summer 2025 release, the platform includes auto-mapping capabilities that solve a persistent data problem. This feature automatically maps fields between different enterprise systems using machine learning algorithms trained on millions of existing data integration patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have worked with data management, you know mapping is a pretty time-consuming work,” Parekh said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auto mapping is all about taking data from a source system, such as SAP, and then using that data with other enterprise data to create a Master Data Management (MDM) record. MDM for enterprise data professionals is the so-called ‘golden record’ as it is intended to be the source of truth about a certain entity. The auto mapping feature can understand the schemas of the different systems and create the correct data field in the MDM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results demonstrate the value of Informatica’s long-term investment in AI. Tasks that previously required deep technical expertise and significant time investment now happen automatically with high accuracy rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our professional services have done some work mapping that typically takes seven days to build,” Parekh said. “This is now being done in less than five minutes,” Parekh said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;A core element of any modern AI system is a natural language interface, typically accompanied by some form of copilot to assist users in executing tasks. In that regard, Informatica is no different than any other enterprise software vendor. Where it differs, though, is still on the metadata and machine learning technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The summer 2025 release enhances Claire Copilot for Data Integration, which became generally available in May 2025 after nine months in early access and preview. The copilot enables users to type requests, such as “bring all Salesforce data into Snowflake,” and have the system orchestrate the necessary pipeline components.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The summer 2025 release adds new interactive capabilities to the copilot, including enhanced question-and-answer features that help users understand how to use the product, with answers sourced directly from documentation and help articles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technical implementation required developing specialized language models fine-tuned for data management tasks using what Parekh calls – Informatica grammar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The natural language translated into Informatica grammar is where our secret sauce comes in,” Parekh explained. “Our whole platform is a metadata driven platform. So underneath we have our own grammar as to how this describes the mapping, what describes the data quality rule, what describes an MDM asset.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-market-timing-enterprise-ai-demands-explode"&gt;Market timing: Enterprise AI demands explode&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timing of Informatica’s AI evolution aligns with fundamental changes in how enterprises consume data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brett Roscoe, SVP &amp;amp; GM, Cloud Data Governance and Cloud Ops at Informatica,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;noted that a big difference in the enterprise data landscape over the last several years has been the scale, with more people than ever needing more access to data. Previously, data requests came primarily from centralized analytics teams with technical expertise; in the gen AI era, those requests come from everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All of a sudden, with the world of gen AI, you’ve got your marketing team and your finance team all asking for data to go drive their generative AI projects,” Roscoe explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The summer release’s AI Governance Inventory and Workflows capabilities tackle this challenge directly. The platform now automatically catalogs AI models, tracks their data sources and maintains lineage from source systems through to AI applications. This addresses enterprise concerns about maintaining visibility and control as AI projects proliferate beyond traditional analytics teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The release also introduces data quality rules as an API, enabling real-time data validation within AI applications rather than batch processing after data movement. This architectural shift allows AI applications to verify data quality at the point of consumption, addressing governance challenges that emerge when non-technical teams launch AI projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-technical-evolution-from-automation-to-orchestration"&gt;Technical evolution: From automation to orchestration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The summer 2025 release demonstrates how Informatica’s AI capabilities have evolved from simple automation to sophisticated orchestration. The enhanced Claire copilot system can break down complex natural language requests into multiple coordinated steps while maintaining human oversight throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system also provides summarization capabilities for existing data workflows, addressing knowledge transfer challenges that plague enterprise data teams. Users can ask the copilot to explain complex integration flows built by previous developers, reducing institutional knowledge dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The release’s support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) and new generative AI connectors for Nvidia NIM, Databricks Mosaic AI and Snowflake Cortex AI demonstrate how the company’s AI infrastructure adapts to emerging technologies while maintaining enterprise governance standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strategic-implications-maturity-wins-in-enterprise-ai-for-data"&gt;Strategic implications: Maturity wins in enterprise AI for data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informatica’s seven-year AI journey, culminating in the enhancements for the summer 2025 release, illustrates a fundamental truth about enterprise AI adoption: sustained domain expertise matters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s approach validates the strategy of building specialized AI capabilities for specific enterprise problems rather than pursuing general-purpose AI solutions. The summer release’s AI-powered lineage discovery and governance workflows represent capabilities that emerge only from years of understanding how enterprises actually manage data at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you didn’t have data management practice before gen AI came around, you’re hurting,” Roscoe noted. “And if you had a data management practice when gen AI came around, you’re still scrambling.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; As enterprises move from AI experimentation to production deployment, Informatica’s approach validates a fundamental truth: in enterprise AI, maturity and specialization matter more than novelty. Enterprises shouldn’t just consider new AI-powered features, but AI capabilities that understand and solve the complex realities of enterprise data management.&lt;/p&gt;

With the latest advancements, even enthusiasts without a developer background can dive right into tapping these models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular applications like Langflow — a low-code, visual platform for designing custom AI workflows — AI enthusiasts can use simple, no-code user interfaces (UIs) to chain generative AI models. And with native integration for Ollama, users can now create local AI workflows and run them at no cost and with complete privacy, powered by NVIDIA GeForce RTX and RTX PRO GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visual Workflows for Generative AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langflow offers an easy-to-use, canvas-style interface where components of generative AI models — like large language models (LLMs), tools, memory stores and control logic — can be connected through a simple drag-and-drop UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows complex AI workflows to be built and modified without manual scripting, easing the development of agents capable of decision-making and multistep actions. AI enthusiasts can iterate and build complex AI workflows without prior coding expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83370"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-large wp-image-83370" height="975" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Langflow-UI-1680x975.png" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83370"&gt;Build complex AI workflows without prior coding expertise in Langflow.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike apps limited to running a single-turn LLM query, Langflow can build advanced AI workflows that behave like intelligent collaborators, capable of analyzing files, retrieving knowledge, executing functions and responding contextually to dynamic inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langflow can run models from the cloud or locally — with full acceleration for RTX GPUs through Ollama. Running workflows locally provides multiple key benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data privacy:&lt;/b&gt; Inputs, files and prompts remain confined to the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low costs and no API keys: &lt;/b&gt;As cloud application programming interface access is not required, there are no token restrictions, service subscriptions or costs associated with running the AI models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance: &lt;/b&gt;RTX GPUs enable low-latency, high-throughput inference, even with long context windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Offline functionality: &lt;/b&gt;Local AI workflows are accessible without the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating Local Agents With Langflow and Ollama&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started with Ollama within Langflow is simple. Built-in starters are available for use cases ranging from travel agents to purchase assistants. The default templates typically run in the cloud for testing, but they can be customized to run locally on RTX GPUs with Langflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83367"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-full wp-image-83367" height="757" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Langflow-built-in-starters.png" width="1192" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83367"&gt;Langflow provides a variety of built-in starters to test AI agents.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build a local workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Langflow desktop app for Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Ollama, then run Ollama and launch the preferred model (Llama 3.1 8B or Qwen3 4B recommended for users’ first workflow).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run Langflow and select a starter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace cloud endpoints with local Ollama runtime. For agentic workflows, set the language model to &lt;i&gt;Custom&lt;/i&gt;, drag an Ollama node to the canvas and connect the agent node’s custom model to the &lt;i&gt;Language Model&lt;/i&gt; output of the Ollama node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templates can be modified and expanded — such as by adding system commands, local file search or structured outputs — to meet advanced automation and assistant use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83376" height="720" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Langflow-settings.gif" width="1280" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch this step-by-step walkthrough from the Langflow team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get Started&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are two sample projects to start exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create a personal travel itinerary agent&lt;/b&gt;: Input all travel requirements — including desired restaurant reservations, travelers’ dietary restrictions and more — to automatically find and arrange accommodations, transport, food and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expand Notion’s capabilities&lt;/b&gt;: Notion, an AI workspace application for organizing projects, can be expanded with AI models that automatically input meeting notes, update the status of projects based on Slack chats or email, and send out project or meeting summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;RTX Remix Adds Model Context Protocol, Unlocking Agent Mods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTX Remix — an open-source platform that allows modders to enhance materials with generative AI tools and create stunning RTX remasters that feature full ray tracing and neural rendering technologies — is adding support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Langflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langflow nodes with MCP give users a direct interface for working with RTX Remix — enabling modders to build modding assistants capable of intelligently interacting with Remix documentation and mod functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help modders get started, NVIDIA’s Langflow Remix template includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A retrieval-augmented generation module with RTX Remix documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time access to Remix documentation for Q&amp;amp;A-style support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An action nodule via MCP that supports direct function execution inside RTX Remix, including asset replacement, metadata updates and automated mod interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modding assistant agents built with this template can determine whether a query is informational or action-oriented. Based on context, agents dynamically respond with guidance or take the requested action. For example, a user might prompt the agent: “Swap this low-resolution texture with a higher-resolution version.” In response, the agent would check the asset’s metadata, locate an appropriate replacement and update the project using MCP functions — without requiring manual interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation and setup instructions for the Remix template are available in the RTX Remix developer guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Control RTX AI PCs With Project G-Assist in Langflow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Project G-Assist is an experimental, on-device AI assistant that runs locally on GeForce RTX PCs. It enables users to query system information (e.g. PC specs, CPU/GPU temperatures, utilization), adjust system settings and more — all through simple natural language prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the G-Assist component in Langflow, these capabilities can be built into custom agentic workflows. Users can prompt G-Assist to “get GPU temperatures” or “tune fan speeds” — and its response and actions will flow through their chain of components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond diagnostics and system control, G-Assist is extensible via its plug-in architecture, which allows users to add new commands tailored to their workflows. Community-built plug-ins can also be invoked directly from Langflow workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started with the G-Assist component in Langflow, read the developer documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langflow is also a development tool for NVIDIA NeMo microservices, a modular platform for building and deploying AI workflows across on-premises or cloud Kubernetes environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With integrated support for Ollama and MCP, Langflow offers a practical no-code platform for building real-time AI workflows and agents that run fully offline and on device, all accelerated by NVIDIA GeForce RTX and RTX PRO GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each week, the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;RTX AI Garage&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;blog series features community-driven AI innovations and content for those looking to learn more about NVIDIA NIM microservices and AI Blueprints, as well as building &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;AI agents&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, creative workflows, productivity apps and more on AI PCs and workstations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Plug in to NVIDIA AI PC on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;TikTok&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; — and stay informed by subscribing to the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;RTX AI PC newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Join NVIDIA’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discord server&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; to connect with community developers and AI enthusiasts for discussions on what’s possible with RTX AI.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow NVIDIA Workstation on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;/footer&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;span class="bsf-rt-reading-time"&gt;&lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-label"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-postfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in generative AI is continuing to grow, as new models include more capabilities. With the latest advancements, even enthusiasts without a developer background can dive right into tapping these models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular applications like Langflow — a low-code, visual platform for designing custom AI workflows — AI enthusiasts can use simple, no-code user interfaces (UIs) to chain generative AI models. And with native integration for Ollama, users can now create local AI workflows and run them at no cost and with complete privacy, powered by NVIDIA GeForce RTX and RTX PRO GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visual Workflows for Generative AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langflow offers an easy-to-use, canvas-style interface where components of generative AI models — like large language models (LLMs), tools, memory stores and control logic — can be connected through a simple drag-and-drop UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows complex AI workflows to be built and modified without manual scripting, easing the development of agents capable of decision-making and multistep actions. AI enthusiasts can iterate and build complex AI workflows without prior coding expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83370"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-large wp-image-83370" height="975" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Langflow-UI-1680x975.png" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83370"&gt;Build complex AI workflows without prior coding expertise in Langflow.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike apps limited to running a single-turn LLM query, Langflow can build advanced AI workflows that behave like intelligent collaborators, capable of analyzing files, retrieving knowledge, executing functions and responding contextually to dynamic inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langflow can run models from the cloud or locally — with full acceleration for RTX GPUs through Ollama. Running workflows locally provides multiple key benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data privacy:&lt;/b&gt; Inputs, files and prompts remain confined to the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low costs and no API keys: &lt;/b&gt;As cloud application programming interface access is not required, there are no token restrictions, service subscriptions or costs associated with running the AI models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance: &lt;/b&gt;RTX GPUs enable low-latency, high-throughput inference, even with long context windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Offline functionality: &lt;/b&gt;Local AI workflows are accessible without the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating Local Agents With Langflow and Ollama&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started with Ollama within Langflow is simple. Built-in starters are available for use cases ranging from travel agents to purchase assistants. The default templates typically run in the cloud for testing, but they can be customized to run locally on RTX GPUs with Langflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83367"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-full wp-image-83367" height="757" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Langflow-built-in-starters.png" width="1192" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83367"&gt;Langflow provides a variety of built-in starters to test AI agents.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build a local workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Langflow desktop app for Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Ollama, then run Ollama and launch the preferred model (Llama 3.1 8B or Qwen3 4B recommended for users’ first workflow).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run Langflow and select a starter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace cloud endpoints with local Ollama runtime. For agentic workflows, set the language model to &lt;i&gt;Custom&lt;/i&gt;, drag an Ollama node to the canvas and connect the agent node’s custom model to the &lt;i&gt;Language Model&lt;/i&gt; output of the Ollama node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templates can be modified and expanded — such as by adding system commands, local file search or structured outputs — to meet advanced automation and assistant use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83376" height="720" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Langflow-settings.gif" width="1280" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch this step-by-step walkthrough from the Langflow team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get Started&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are two sample projects to start exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create a personal travel itinerary agent&lt;/b&gt;: Input all travel requirements — including desired restaurant reservations, travelers’ dietary restrictions and more — to automatically find and arrange accommodations, transport, food and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expand Notion’s capabilities&lt;/b&gt;: Notion, an AI workspace application for organizing projects, can be expanded with AI models that automatically input meeting notes, update the status of projects based on Slack chats or email, and send out project or meeting summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;RTX Remix Adds Model Context Protocol, Unlocking Agent Mods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTX Remix — an open-source platform that allows modders to enhance materials with generative AI tools and create stunning RTX remasters that feature full ray tracing and neural rendering technologies — is adding support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Langflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langflow nodes with MCP give users a direct interface for working with RTX Remix — enabling modders to build modding assistants capable of intelligently interacting with Remix documentation and mod functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help modders get started, NVIDIA’s Langflow Remix template includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A retrieval-augmented generation module with RTX Remix documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time access to Remix documentation for Q&amp;amp;A-style support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An action nodule via MCP that supports direct function execution inside RTX Remix, including asset replacement, metadata updates and automated mod interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modding assistant agents built with this template can determine whether a query is informational or action-oriented. Based on context, agents dynamically respond with guidance or take the requested action. For example, a user might prompt the agent: “Swap this low-resolution texture with a higher-resolution version.” In response, the agent would check the asset’s metadata, locate an appropriate replacement and update the project using MCP functions — without requiring manual interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation and setup instructions for the Remix template are available in the RTX Remix developer guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Control RTX AI PCs With Project G-Assist in Langflow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond diagnostics and system control, G-Assist is extensible via its plug-in architecture, which allows users to add new commands tailored to their workflows. Community-built plug-ins can also be invoked directly from Langflow workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started with the G-Assist component in Langflow, read the developer documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said it will consider data from Google accounts, including types of details users have searched for or categories of videos they have watched on YouTube, to determine the age. If the company’s tool decides that a user is under 18, they would get an email with details about how Google products might change for them.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For these users, Google will disable the timeline in Maps, stop personalized ads, restrict age-restricted ad categories, and bar them from accessing adult-themed apps on the Play Store. The company will also turn on digital well-being features on YouTube, such as break reminders and “go to bed” notifications when consuming videos late at night. Plus, it will prevent underage users from accessing certain kinds of content —&amp;nbsp;such as content that could trigger body image issues — repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If users think they have been tagged as an underage account by mistake, they can appeal the decision and prove their age using a photo of their government ID or a selfie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google rolled out similar measures for YouTube earlier this week, and now the company is experimenting with machine learning-based age gating in the U.S. for Google accounts at large. The company said that it has experimented with age-estimation tech in some markets (without specifying which ones), and it worked well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Age assurance helps us ensure that adults can access the information and services they need, while also applying the right protections for our younger users. Our approach to age assurance uses a combination of age estimation and, when necessary, age verification,” Google said in a post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other platforms, including Instagram and Roblox, have also started using AI to estimate the age of their users. Lawmakers have been at work to put in rules related to serving appropriate content to minors. In the U.S., several states have existing or proposed laws around age gating. Meanwhile, platforms have also started age verification in the U.K. following the passing of the Online Safety Act.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2169510461.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google is testing a machine learning-powered tech in the U.S. to determine the age of users and filter content across all its products accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-has-study-mode"&gt;ChatGPT now has study mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-warns-that-chatgpt-therapy-isn-t-confidential"&gt;Altman warns that ChatGPT therapy isn’t confidential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-2-5b-prompts-daily"&gt;ChatGPT hits 2.5B prompts daily&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt"&gt;OpenAI launches a general-purpose agent in ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-warns-of-major-risks-with-ai-therapy-chatbots"&gt;Study warns of major risks with AI therapy chatbots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-delays-releasing-its-open-model-again"&gt;OpenAI delays releasing its open model again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we planned to launch our open-weight model next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) July 12, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-is-testing-a-mysterious-new-feature-called-study-together"&gt;ChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called “study together”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-referrals-from-chatgpt-to-news-sites-are-rising-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news sites are rising but not enough to offset search declines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="june2025"&gt;June 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-uses-google-s-ai-chips-to-power-its-products"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI uses Google’s AI chips to power its products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-energy-needed-for-an-average-chatgpt-query-can-power-a-lightbulb-for-a-couple-of-minutes"&gt;The energy needed for an average ChatGPT query can power a lightbulb for a couple of minutes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o3-pro-an-upgraded-version-of-its-o3-ai-reasoning-model"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has launched o3-pro, an upgraded version of its o3 AI reasoning model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.…&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 10, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-conversational-voice-mode-has-been-upgraded"&gt;ChatGPT’s conversational voice mode has been upgraded&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-added-new-features-like-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT has added new features like meeting recording and connectors for Google Drive, Box, and more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-may-2025"&gt;May 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cfo-says-hardware-will-drive-chatgpt-s-growth"&gt;OpenAI CFO says hardware will drive ChatGPT’s growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI’s reach to a larger audience in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-chatgpt-unveils-its-ai-coding-agent-codex"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT unveils its AI coding agent, Codex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-altman-aims-to-make-chatgpt-more-personalized-by-tracking-every-aspect-of-a-person-s-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Altman aims to make ChatGPT more personalized by tracking every aspect of a person’s life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-releases-its-gpt-4-1-and-gpt-4-1-mini-ai-models-in-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI releases its GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini AI models in ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks &amp;amp; instruction following. Because it’s faster, it’s a great alternative to OpenAI o3 &amp;amp; o4-mini for everyday coding needs.&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 14, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-deep-research-now-connects-with-github-in-beta-to-answer-code-related-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT deep research now connects with GitHub (in beta) to answer code-related questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-new-data-residency-program-in-asia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches a new data residency program in Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-introduce-a-program-to-grow-ai-infrastructure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to introduce a program to grow AI infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company’s expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-promises-to-make-changes-to-prevent-future-chatgpt-sycophancy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april-2025"&gt;April 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-clarifies-the-reason-chatgpt-became-overly-flattering-and-agreeable"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-to-fix-a-bug-that-let-minors-engage-in-inappropriate-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-helps-users-by-giving-recommendations-showing-images-and-reviewing-products-for-online-shopping"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is continually updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2191707579.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-july-2025"&gt;July 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-has-study-mode"&gt;ChatGPT now has study mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-warns-that-chatgpt-therapy-isn-t-confidential"&gt;Altman warns that ChatGPT therapy isn’t confidential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-2-5b-prompts-daily"&gt;ChatGPT hits 2.5B prompts daily&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt"&gt;OpenAI launches a general-purpose agent in ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-warns-of-major-risks-with-ai-therapy-chatbots"&gt;Study warns of major risks with AI therapy chatbots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-delays-releasing-its-open-model-again"&gt;OpenAI delays releasing its open model again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we planned to launch our open-weight model next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) July 12, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-is-testing-a-mysterious-new-feature-called-study-together"&gt;ChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called “study together”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-referrals-from-chatgpt-to-news-sites-are-rising-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news sites are rising but not enough to offset search declines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="june2025"&gt;June 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-uses-google-s-ai-chips-to-power-its-products"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI uses Google’s AI chips to power its products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-energy-needed-for-an-average-chatgpt-query-can-power-a-lightbulb-for-a-couple-of-minutes"&gt;The energy needed for an average ChatGPT query can power a lightbulb for a couple of minutes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o3-pro-an-upgraded-version-of-its-o3-ai-reasoning-model"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has launched o3-pro, an upgraded version of its o3 AI reasoning model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.…&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 10, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-conversational-voice-mode-has-been-upgraded"&gt;ChatGPT’s conversational voice mode has been upgraded&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-added-new-features-like-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT has added new features like meeting recording and connectors for Google Drive, Box, and more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-may-2025"&gt;May 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cfo-says-hardware-will-drive-chatgpt-s-growth"&gt;OpenAI CFO says hardware will drive ChatGPT’s growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI’s reach to a larger audience in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-chatgpt-unveils-its-ai-coding-agent-codex"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT unveils its AI coding agent, Codex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-altman-aims-to-make-chatgpt-more-personalized-by-tracking-every-aspect-of-a-person-s-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Altman aims to make ChatGPT more personalized by tracking every aspect of a person’s life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-releases-its-gpt-4-1-and-gpt-4-1-mini-ai-models-in-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI releases its GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini AI models in ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks &amp;amp; instruction following. Because it’s faster, it’s a great alternative to OpenAI o3 &amp;amp; o4-mini for everyday coding needs.&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 14, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-deep-research-now-connects-with-github-in-beta-to-answer-code-related-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT deep research now connects with GitHub (in beta) to answer code-related questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-new-data-residency-program-in-asia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches a new data residency program in Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-introduce-a-program-to-grow-ai-infrastructure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to introduce a program to grow AI infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company’s expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-promises-to-make-changes-to-prevent-future-chatgpt-sycophancy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april-2025"&gt;April 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-clarifies-the-reason-chatgpt-became-overly-flattering-and-agreeable"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-to-fix-a-bug-that-let-minors-engage-in-inappropriate-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-helps-users-by-giving-recommendations-showing-images-and-reviewing-products-for-online-shopping"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is continually updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 14:52:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] OpenAI to launch AI data center in Norway, its first in Europe (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/openai-to-launch-ai-data-center-in-norway-its-first-in-europe/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2173788627.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI said Thursday that it plans to launch Stargate Norway, its first AI data center in Europe, in partnership with British AI cloud infrastructure provider Nscale and Norwegian energy infrastructure firm Aker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nscale will design and build the site, and it will be a 50/50 joint venture between the two companies. OpenAI will be an “off-taker” in the project, buying capacity from the data center.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement comes as Europe races to achieve AI sovereignty and invest in data centers and compute power. Earlier this week, the bloc unveiled details of its multibillion-dollar investment into AI infrastructure, including €10 billion ($11.8 billion) to set up 13 AI factories and €20 billion as an initial investment in the factories. Data sovereignty is key to that mission, due to the sensitive nature of business and government data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nscale and OpenAI told TechCrunch that Stargate Norway isn’t a part of the European Union’s plans to scale AI at home. Nscale CEO Josh Payne told CNBC that part of the purpose of this project is to “leverage European sovereign compute” for the benefit of the continent. Norway’s AI ecosystem, like startups and scientific researchers, will get priority access to the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNBC also reported that Nscale and Aker have each committed around $1 billion to the initial 20 megawatt (MW) phase of the project. OpenAI says Stargate Norway will initially deliver 230 MW capacity, with plans to expand to 290 MW, and will run on 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The site will be located near Narvik, a small town in northern Norway. OpenAI said in a blog post the region is notable for its access to hydropower, a cool climate, and a “mature industrial base.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The facility will run entirely on renewable power and is expected to incorporate closed-loop, direct-to-chip liquid cooling to ensure maximum cooling efficiency,” said OpenAI. “Additionally, excess heat from the GPU systems will be made available to support low-carbon enterprises in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Per the EU AI Act, which took effect in August 2024 and bans systems with “unacceptable risk,” companies building data centers must take steps to protect the environment and be transparent about the energy consumption of AI models. Additionally, the bloc’s Energy Efficiency Directive emphasizes energy efficiency in the ICT sector, which includes data centers. The directive also directs data centers exceeding certain energy input thresholds to recover waste heat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Stargate Norway announcement comes seven months after OpenAI announced it would invest $500 billion into 10 gigawatts of AI infrastructure in the United States over the next four years, in partnership with Oracle and SoftBank. The deal also follows the launch of Stargate UAE earlier this year, and a recently signed deal with the U.K. government to accelerate AI adoption and boost infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was updated to clarify that Stargate Norway is separate from the EU’s investment into AI infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2173788627.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI said Thursday that it plans to launch Stargate Norway, its first AI data center in Europe, in partnership with British AI cloud infrastructure provider Nscale and Norwegian energy infrastructure firm Aker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nscale will design and build the site, and it will be a 50/50 joint venture between the two companies. OpenAI will be an “off-taker” in the project, buying capacity from the data center.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement comes as Europe races to achieve AI sovereignty and invest in data centers and compute power. Earlier this week, the bloc unveiled details of its multibillion-dollar investment into AI infrastructure, including €10 billion ($11.8 billion) to set up 13 AI factories and €20 billion as an initial investment in the factories. Data sovereignty is key to that mission, due to the sensitive nature of business and government data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nscale and OpenAI told TechCrunch that Stargate Norway isn’t a part of the European Union’s plans to scale AI at home. Nscale CEO Josh Payne told CNBC that part of the purpose of this project is to “leverage European sovereign compute” for the benefit of the continent. Norway’s AI ecosystem, like startups and scientific researchers, will get priority access to the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNBC also reported that Nscale and Aker have each committed around $1 billion to the initial 20 megawatt (MW) phase of the project. OpenAI says Stargate Norway will initially deliver 230 MW capacity, with plans to expand to 290 MW, and will run on 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The site will be located near Narvik, a small town in northern Norway. OpenAI said in a blog post the region is notable for its access to hydropower, a cool climate, and a “mature industrial base.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The facility will run entirely on renewable power and is expected to incorporate closed-loop, direct-to-chip liquid cooling to ensure maximum cooling efficiency,” said OpenAI. “Additionally, excess heat from the GPU systems will be made available to support low-carbon enterprises in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Per the EU AI Act, which took effect in August 2024 and bans systems with “unacceptable risk,” companies building data centers must take steps to protect the environment and be transparent about the energy consumption of AI models. Additionally, the bloc’s Energy Efficiency Directive emphasizes energy efficiency in the ICT sector, which includes data centers. The directive also directs data centers exceeding certain energy input thresholds to recover waste heat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

But what if we could give city planners superpowers? What if they could test-drive a dozen different futures before a single shovel hits the ground?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what’s starting to happen. And the secret ingredient is AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Headshot of Shah Muhammad, who leads AI Innovation at the design and engineering firm Sweco, and has given his insights on how AI is building the future of our cities." class="wp-image-107259" height="683" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shah-muhammad-sweco-group-ai.jpeg" width="683" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI is revolutionising urban design and infrastructure planning at Sweco by optimising processes, enhancing decision-making, and improving sustainability outcomes,” Shah explains. “It allows us to analyse vast amounts of data, simulate various scenarios, and create more efficient and resilient urban environments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah is saying that AI gives his team the ability to ask the big questions that will impact people’s lives when designing the cities of the future: “What’s the smartest way to build this neighbourhood to cut down on traffic jams and pollution? How can we design a building that stays cool in a heatwave without huge electricity bills?” The AI can run the numbers on thousands of possibilities to find the best path forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the real world is messy. It’s not a neat and tidy computer simulation. It’s full of unpredictable weather, unexpected delays, and the beautiful chaos of human life. This is the number one headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest challenge in applying data-driven models to physical environments is the complexity and variability of real-world conditions,” Shah says. “Ensuring that models accurately represent these conditions and can adapt to changing conditions is crucial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how do they deal with that? They start with the basics. They get their house in order. Before they even think about AI, they make sure the information it learns from is rock-solid and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To ensure data quality and interoperability across projects, we implement rigorous data governance practices, standardise data formats, and use interoperable software tools,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might sound a bit technical, but think of it this way: they’re making sure everyone on the team is singing from the same hymn sheet. When all the different software tools can talk to each other and everyone trusts the information, the AI can do its job properly. It “enables seamless data exchange and collaboration among different teams and stakeholders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of all the things AI can do, this next part might be the most hopeful when using it to design future cities. It shows that this technology can have a real heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are many projects where AI has made a measurable impact on sustainability, making it hard to single out one,” he reflects. “However, if I were to choose, I would highlight a project where AI was used to preserve biodiversity by identifying endangered species and providing this information to researchers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, technology is giving nature a voice in the planning meeting. It’s like the AI raising its hand and saying, “Hang on, let’s be careful here, there’s a family of rare birds living in this area.” It allows us to build with respect for the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the next chapter? According to Shah, it’s about turning that crystal ball into a real-time guide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“According to me, the biggest opportunity for AI in the AEC sector lies in predictive analytics and automation,” Shah explains. “By anticipating future trends, identifying potential issues early, and automating routine tasks, AI can greatly enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the overall quality of projects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could mean safer bridges, roads that need fewer repairs, and less disruption to our lives.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The API doesn’t require a separate fee. Instead, usage is tracked via Poe’s existing point-based subscription plans, where each model call costs a set number of points. For instance, low-quality image generation through GPT-4o in a 1:1 aspect ratio and 1024 x 1024 size would cost 328 points.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, Poe’s plans include the $4.99 per month plan (10,000 points per day), the $19.99/mo plan (1 million points per month), the $49.99/mo plan (2.5 million points per month), the $99.99/mo plan (5 million points per month), and the $249.99/mo plan (12.5 million points per month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Developers will also be able to buy additional points at a rate of $30 for 1 million tokens. Add-on tokens don’t come in a fixed package, so customers can pay any dollar amount to get tokens based on that rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Through this API, developers can power tools like Cursor, Cline, Continue, Roo, and any others that work with OpenAI-compatible chat completion APIs. The platform currently provides access to more than 100 models across voice, text, image, and video generation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These multimodal models include Imagen 4, GPT Image 1, Flux Kontext, Seedream 3.0, Veo 3, Runway Gen 4 Turbo, Kling 2.1, ElevenLabs, and Lyria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3032708" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Quora&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Currently, we are working on allowing developers to take a private bot they have built on Poe and use that through an API. Plus, we are thinking about better key management for developers for the API product,” Gareth Jones, Poe’s product lead for creators and developers, told TechCrunch over a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While API provides a way for developers to use different models, Poe also offers tools aimed at consumers. Earlier this year, the company introduced a new way to allow users to easily create AI-powered apps. It also offers templates to build server bots, prompt bots, and image generation bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the moment, developers will need to pick and manage model use manually.

These days, the company behind that app, and the many apps that followed, is struggling. And AI may partially be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday, the company known as the Iconfactory admitted it was at a crossroads and was putting up several of its apps for sale due to a lack of resources. While the announcement positioned the matter as a situation where the Iconfactory’s app catalog had simply grown to include too many apps to keep up with and not enough time to do so, the reality is that the business today has no choice but to focus on the apps that offer a better return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Side products can no longer be maintained, even if they have “loads of happy and loyal customers,” as the Iconfactory’s co-founder, Ged Maheux, says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says that it will continue to work on apps like Tapestry, Linea Sketch, Wallaroo, and Tot, as well as its new project involving Retro Pixel Portraits, but is accepting “serious offers” for the other apps. These sales will include intellectual property and source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of particular interest is that the company points to AI significantly affecting its business as the reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“ChatGPT and other AI services are basically killing @Iconfactory, and I’m not exaggerating or being hyperbolical,” Iconfactory developer Sean Heber said in a Mastodon post earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The issue isn’t that people are using AI instead of mobile apps, but how vibe coding is affecting the need for app design firms like theirs. Besides building its own apps, the Iconfactory generated revenue by offering app design services, which include things like icon design (hence the name), app design, marketing asset creation, plus branding and consulting services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These services helped fuel the business that’s now being destroyed by AI. “I know nothing I say is going to get anyone to stop using ChatGPT and generating a new app icon in 5 minutes for the app that you also had ChatGPT write for you in a few hours, but I’m not sure what the rest of us are supposed to do about making enough money to, ya know, live,” Heber wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another issue for the longtime app makers at the Iconfactory was the shutdown of its most popular app, Twitterifc, which was killed by Elon Musk in 2023 when the company (now known as X) officially banned all third-party clients. The move put Twitterific, Tweetbot, and other apps almost instantly out of business, leading the Iconfactory to plead with its users to decline their App Store refunds to help them stay afloat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That, too, has affected the Iconfactory’s future, Heber admitted in his posts.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“First Twitter/Elon killed our main app revenue that kept the lights on around here, then generative AI exploded to land a final blow to design revenue,” he wrote. “I think perhaps because @Iconfactory design is quite good people have this impression that we’re sitting here on a pile of money or something and some huge powerhouse – nope. We’ve been barely making it since Elon/Twitter. There’s only 6 of us and there’s no war chest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After shutting down Twitterific, the Iconfactory turned to the open social web as a way to generate a new revenue stream. It launched an app called Tapestry, which allows users to track sources across the open web, including RSS feeds, YouTube, Bluesky, podcasts, Mastodon, Reddit, Tumblr, Micro.blog, and others. The app offers a variety of clever tools for organizing sources, making feeds, muting and hiding content you don’t want to see, and more. It also offered a way for third-party developers to extend Tapestry with add-ons called Connectors, allowing users to add even more open feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That app will remain a part of the company’s efforts for now — a Mac app is in the works — but even its future could be uncertain. For one thing, open social media platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky are still dwarfed by tech giants, which means consumer demand for something like Tapestry is fairly niche. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Heber shared, the app’s Kickstarter was a bit of a “Hail Mary” on the company’s part, but people aren’t subscribing in great enough numbers to make up for the revenue that Twitterific once brought in, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If AI continues to commoditize the business of app making, the Iconfactory won’t be alone in suffering the consequences. But vibe-coded apps aren’t necessarily what consumers need, not only because of the lack of human input, but also the lax security some of these apps offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Reached for comment, Maheux agreed that AI had “definitely put a damper on the design side of our services,” though it hasn’t “killed” the company yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Many indie developers have adopted AI for an inexpensive or free solution for graphical work like app icons, which has been a core part of the services we offer. We still do, of course, but the frequency of developers coming to us for these services has declined greatly in the last few years,” he told TechCrunch via email. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He also cited other factors impacting the business, like Apple’s graphical system, SF Symbols, that developers can use instead. Consumers are tiring of subscriptions for everything. Plus, he points out that the cost of everything has increased over the years, while the cost of apps has not, making it harder to make a living as a small business developer.  &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve had to expand our offerings into other areas like UX consulting, coding consultation, and side revenue services to try and make up the revenue from this lost design work. Apple’s introduction of Liquid Glass has offered some new opportunities for design work and consultation, and we’ve been working with a handful of companies on this, so that’s been hopeful,” he noted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated after publication with company comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tapestry-Quicklinks-New.jpg?resize=1200,683" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;At one point, an app called Twitterrific was one of the most popular iPhone apps for browsing Twitter. These days, the company behind that app, and the many apps that followed, is struggling. And AI may partially be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday, the company known as the Iconfactory admitted it was at a crossroads and was putting up several of its apps for sale due to a lack of resources. While the announcement positioned the matter as a situation where the Iconfactory’s app catalog had simply grown to include too many apps to keep up with and not enough time to do so, the reality is that the business today has no choice but to focus on the apps that offer a better return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Side products can no longer be maintained, even if they have “loads of happy and loyal customers,” as the Iconfactory’s co-founder, Ged Maheux, says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says that it will continue to work on apps like Tapestry, Linea Sketch, Wallaroo, and Tot, as well as its new project involving Retro Pixel Portraits, but is accepting “serious offers” for the other apps. These sales will include intellectual property and source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of particular interest is that the company points to AI significantly affecting its business as the reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“ChatGPT and other AI services are basically killing @Iconfactory, and I’m not exaggerating or being hyperbolical,” Iconfactory developer Sean Heber said in a Mastodon post earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The issue isn’t that people are using AI instead of mobile apps, but how vibe coding is affecting the need for app design firms like theirs. Besides building its own apps, the Iconfactory generated revenue by offering app design services, which include things like icon design (hence the name), app design, marketing asset creation, plus branding and consulting services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese AI startup Manus, which made headlines earlier this year for its approach to a multi-agent orchestration platform for consumers and “pro”-sumers (professionals wanting to run work operations), is back with an interesting new use of its technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many other major rival AI providers such as OpenAI, Google, and xAI that have launched “Deep Research” or “Deep Researcher” AI agents that conduct minutes or hours of extensive, in-depth web research and write well-cited, thorough reports on behalf of users, Manus is taking a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company just announced “Wide Research,” a new experimental feature that enables users to execute large-scale, high-volume tasks by leveraging the power of parallelized AI agents — even more than 100 at a single time, all focused on completing a single task (or series of sub-tasks laddering up said overarching goal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manus was previously reported to be using Anthropic Claude and Alibaba Qwen models to power its platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a video posted on the official X account, Manus co-founder and Chief Scientist Yichao ‘Peak’ Ji shows a demo of using Wide Research to compare 100 sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To complete the task, Manus Wide Research nearly instantly spins up 100 concurrent subagents — each assigned to analyze one shoe’s design, pricing, and availability. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is a sortable matrix delivered in both spreadsheet and webpage formats within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company suggests Wide Research isn’t limited to data analysis. It can also be used for creative tasks like design exploration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one scenario, Manus agents simultaneously generated poster designs across 50 distinct visual styles, returning polished assets in a downloadable ZIP file. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Manus, this flexibility stems from the system-level approach to parallel processing and agent-to-agent communication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the video, Peak explains that Wide Research is the first application of an optimized virtualization and agent architecture capable of scaling compute power 100 times beyond initial offerings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The feature is designed to activate automatically during tasks that require wide-scale analysis, with no manual toggles or configurations required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-availability-and-pricing"&gt;Availability and pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wide Research is available starting today for users on Manus Pro plan and will gradually become accessible to those on the Plus and Basic plans. As of now, subscription pricing for Manus is structured as follows per month. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free&lt;/strong&gt; – $0/month Includes 300 daily refresh credits, access to Chat mode, 1 concurrent task, and 1 scheduled task.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic&lt;/strong&gt; – $19/month Adds 1,900 monthly credits (+1,900 bonus during limited offer), 2 concurrent and 2 scheduled tasks, access to advanced models in Agent mode, image/video/slides generation, and exclusive data sources.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plus&lt;/strong&gt; – $39/month Increases to 3 concurrent and 3 scheduled tasks, 3,900 monthly credits (+3,900 bonus), and includes all Basic features.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro&lt;/strong&gt; – $199/month Offers 10 concurrent and 10 scheduled tasks, 19,900 credits (+19,900 bonus), early access to beta features, a Manus T-shirt, and the full feature set including advanced agent tools and content generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also a 17% discount on these prices for users who wish to pay up-front annually. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The launch builds on the infrastructure introduced with Manus earlier this year, which the company describes as not just an AI agent, but a personal cloud computing platform. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each Manus session runs on a dedicated virtual machine, giving users access to orchestrated cloud compute through natural language — a setup the company sees as key to enabling true general-purpose AI workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Wide Research, Manus users can delegate research or creative exploration across dozens or even hundreds of subagents. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional multi-agent systems with predefined roles (such as manager, coder, or designer), each subagent within Wide Research is a fully capable, fully featured Manus instance — not a specialized one for a specific role — operating independently and able to take on any general task. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This architectural decision, the company says, opens the door to flexible, scalable task handling unconstrained by rigid templates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-benefits-of-wide-over-deep-research"&gt;What are the benefits of Wide over Deep Research?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implication seems to be that running all these agents in parallel is faster and will result in a better and more varied set of work products beyond research reports, as opposed to the single “Deep Research” agents other AI providers have shown or fielded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while Manus promotes Wide Research as a breakthrough in agent parallelism, the company does not provide direct evidence that spawning dozens or hundreds of subagents is more effective than having a single, high-capacity agent handle tasks sequentially. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The release does not include performance benchmarks, comparisons, or technical explanations to justify the trade-offs of this approach — such as increased resource usage, coordination complexity, or potential inefficiencies. It also lacks details on how subagents collaborate, how results are merged, or whether the system offers measurable advantages in speed, accuracy, or cost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, while the feature showcases architectural ambition, its practical benefits over simpler methods remain unproven based on the information provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sub-agents-have-a-mixed-track-record-more-generally-so-far"&gt;Sub-agents have a mixed track record more generally, so far… &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Manus’s implementation of Wide Research is positioned as an advancement in general AI agent systems, the broader ecosystem has seen mixed results with similar subagent approaches. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, on Reddit, self-described users of Claude’s Code have raised concerns about its subagents being slow, consuming large volumes of tokens, and offering limited visibility into execution. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Common pain points include lack of coordination protocols between agents, difficulties in debugging, and erratic performance during high-load periods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These challenges don’t necessarily reflect on Manus’s implementation, but they highlight the complexity of developing robust multi-agent frameworks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manus acknowledges that Wide Research is still experimental and may come with some limitations as development continues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the rollout of Wide Research, Manus deepens its commitment to redefining how users interact with AI agents at scale. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As other platforms wrestle with the technical challenges of subagent coordination and reliability, Manus’s approach may serve as a test case for whether generalized agent instances — rather than narrowly scoped modules — can deliver on the vision of seamless, multi-threaded AI collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company hints at broader ambitions, suggesting that the infrastructure behind Wide Research lays the groundwork for future offerings. Users and industry watchers alike will be paying close attention to whether this new wave of agent architecture can live up to its potential — or whether the challenges seen elsewhere in the AI space will eventually catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plus&lt;/strong&gt; – $39/month Increases to 3 concurrent and 3 scheduled tasks, 3,900 monthly credits (+3,900 bonus), and includes all Basic features.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro&lt;/strong&gt; – $199/month Offers 10 concurrent and 10 scheduled tasks, 19,900 credits (+19,900 bonus), early access to beta features, a Manus T-shirt, and the full feature set including advanced agent tools and content generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also a 17% discount on these prices for users who wish to pay up-front annually. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The launch builds on the infrastructure introduced with Manus earlier this year, which the company describes as not just an AI agent, but a personal cloud computing platform. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each Manus session runs on a dedicated virtual machine, giving users access to orchestrated cloud compute through natural language — a setup the company sees as key to enabling true general-purpose AI workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Wide Research, Manus users can delegate research or creative exploration across dozens or even hundreds of subagents. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional multi-agent systems with predefined roles (such as manager, coder, or designer), each subagent within Wide Research is a fully capable, fully featured Manus instance — not a specialized one for a specific role — operating independently and able to take on any general task. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This architectural decision, the company says, opens the door to flexible, scalable task handling unconstrained by rigid templates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-benefits-of-wide-over-deep-research"&gt;What are the benefits of Wide over Deep Research?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implication seems to be that running all these agents in parallel is faster and will result in a better and more varied set of work products beyond research reports, as opposed to the single “Deep Research” agents other AI providers have shown or fielded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while Manus promotes Wide Research as a breakthrough in agent parallelism, the company does not provide direct evidence that spawning dozens or hundreds of subagents is more effective than having a single, high-capacity agent handle tasks sequentially. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The release does not include performance benchmarks, comparisons, or technical explanations to justify the trade-offs of this approach — such as increased resource usage, coordination complexity, or potential inefficiencies. It also lacks details on how subagents collaborate, how results are merged, or whether the system offers measurable advantages in speed, accuracy, or cost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, while the feature showcases architectural ambition, its practical benefits over simpler methods remain unproven based on the information provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sub-agents-have-a-mixed-track-record-more-generally-so-far"&gt;Sub-agents have a mixed track record more generally, so far… &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Manus’s implementation of Wide Research is positioned as an advancement in general AI agent systems, the broader ecosystem has seen mixed results with similar subagent approaches. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, on Reddit, self-described users of Claude’s Code have raised concerns about its subagents being slow, consuming large volumes of tokens, and offering limited visibility into execution. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Common pain points include lack of coordination protocols between agents, difficulties in debugging, and erratic performance during high-load periods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These challenges don’t necessarily reflect on Manus’s implementation, but they highlight the complexity of developing robust multi-agent frameworks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manus acknowledges that Wide Research is still experimental and may come with some limitations as development continues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the rollout of Wide Research, Manus deepens its commitment to redefining how users interact with AI agents at scale. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As other platforms wrestle with the technical challenges of subagent coordination and reliability, Manus’s approach may serve as a test case for whether generalized agent instances — rather than narrowly scoped modules — can deliver on the vision of seamless, multi-threaded AI collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company hints at broader ambitions, suggesting that the infrastructure behind Wide Research lays the groundwork for future offerings. Users and industry watchers alike will be paying close attention to whether this new wave of agent architecture can live up to its potential — or whether the challenges seen elsewhere in the AI space will eventually catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, it proposes streamlining permitting for AI infrastructure (such as semiconductor manufacturing facilities, data centers, and energy infrastructure) adopting AI in the federal government and military, and funding AI research. But there’s a lot more in the plan, too: both a surprisingly strong focus on AI safety, as well as some items of concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Plan includes several policies that advance AI safety. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;While most of the plan’s policies are intended to accelerate AI development and deployment, it also correctly observes that AI development will only benefit Americans if done safely. Accordingly, it proposes several policies that advance AI safety. Some of the policies most relevant to AI safety include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest in AI Interpretability, Control, and Robustness Breakthroughs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build an AI Evaluations Ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolster Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promote Secure-By-Design AI Technologies and Applications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promote Mature Federal Capacity for AI Incident Response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strengthen AI Compute Export Control Enforcement (this proposes location verification for AI chips)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that the U.S. Government is at the Forefront of Evaluating National Security Risks in Frontier Models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest in Biosecurity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;not comprehensive, these policies are a great step in the right direction—and much better than might have been expected given the administration’s previous &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-vice-president-the-artificial-intelligence-action-summit-paris-france" rel="rel"&gt;rhetorical disregard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for AI safety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;the plan introduces sensible policies that reflect the expertise of those who developed it. However, it is also shaped by the larger policy agenda of the Trump Administration, which may conflict with AI safety goals. We discuss some areas of potential concern below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan does not want state AI legislation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;One section proposes that the Federal government “should not allow AI-related Federal funding to be directed toward states with burdensome AI regulations that waste these funds, but should also not interfere with states’ rights to pass prudent laws that are not unduly restrictive to innovation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This rule is less strict than Sen. Cruz’s failed AI regulation moratorium. But what constitutes a “burdensome” regulation will vary depending on who you ask (particularly if you ask frontier AI companies). In response to the plan, both Congressional Democrats and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=8605" rel="rel"&gt;expressed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/repmtg/status/1948400163875152237" rel="rel"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; about stifling state AI regulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan has a partisan view on what constitutes ideological bias.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; In a section on ensuring that AI “objectively reflects truth,” one policy instructs NIST to “revise the NIST AI Risk Management Framework to eliminate references to misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A policy to promote objectivity in AI models could be great. However, that policy could itself be weaponized to promote ideological ends. In their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=8605" rel="rel"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Congressional Democrats wrote that “we support true AI neutrality—AI models trained on facts and science—but the administration's fixation on ‘anti-woke’ inputs is definitionally not neutral.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan endorses open-weight models.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; It writes that, “while the decision of whether and how to release an open or closed model is fundamentally up to the developer, the Federal government should create a supportive environment for open models.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraging US companies to release open-weight models with dangerous capabilities would be a bad policy. But the specific policies the plan lists stop short of that—they mostly just provide resources to academic researchers (who are unlikely to develop frontier models) through the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan forgoes AI nonproliferation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The plan argues that the US “must meet global demand for AI by exporting its full AI technology stack—hardware, models, software, applications, and standards—to all countries willing to join America’s AI alliance.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This plan’s rationale for this policy is that countries might otherwise look to acquire Chinese AI exports. However, it also continues the Trump Administration's reversal of the Biden-era policy (see the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/15/2025-00636/framework-for-artificial-intelligence-diffusion" rel="rel"&gt;AI Diffusion Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) that sought to prevent the proliferation of dangerous AI capabilities abroad. While exporting American AI might strengthen the US’ position in the AI race, it also threatens to proliferate dangerous AI capabilities to malicious actors if the US does not ensure that other states implement robust security standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan advances a zero-sum race narrative. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kratsios, Sacks, and Rubio write that the promise of AI “is ours to seize, or to lose.” That is, they assume that the alternative to “AI dominance” is to give up AI’s benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This argument is misleading—or at least underdeveloped. While there are reasons to support a US lead in AI, AI progress has the potential to benefit Americans whether or not the US “dominates” international AI development. Historically, general purpose technologies like AI &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691260341/technology-and-the-rise-of-great-powers" rel="rel"&gt;diffuse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; across national boundaries. For example, technologies electricity and the internet have benefited people around the world, and not just within the nations that led their development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The real motivation behind the AI race narrative in Washington is not seizing AI’s benefits, but rather competition over the balance of international power between the US and China. While there are reasons to be concerned about AI development dominated by China, racing towards US dominance is not the only alternative—and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/why-racing-to-artificial-superintelligence-would-undermine-americas-national-security" rel="rel"&gt;creates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; its own risks. In order to preserve international security, the US will need to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationalsecurity.ai/chapter/deterrence-with-mutual-assured-ai-malfunction-maim" rel="rel"&gt;proactively manage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—rather than just accelerate—a US-China AI race.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Thursday, OpenAI &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/" rel="rel"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a new agent mode for ChatGPT, which integrates Operator, Deep Research, and chatbot functionality into a unified system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system, ‘ChatGPT agent,’ has access to its own virtual computer, and OpenAI highlights that it can book flights and reservations, create slides and spreadsheets, and make online purchases. It can also connect to users’ personal accounts, for example, Google Calendar, Gmail, and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT agent achieves SOTA performance on HLE and FrontierMath.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; ChatGPT agent’s capabilities extend beyond basic online automation—it achieves SOTA performance on several benchmarks measuring expert-level knowledge and reasoning. For example, ChatGPT agent gets 23% on Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), when it does not use tools. When it uses tools like browsers and computer code, it gets 41.6%. This is similar to Grok 4, which gets 25.4% on HLE without tools and 44.4% with tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YR3_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c045cf-daf7-4254-8cdc-4dd861f2c397_884x802.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="802" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YR3_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c045cf-daf7-4254-8cdc-4dd861f2c397_884x802.png" width="884" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;also evaluated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;ChatGPT agent against benchmarks measuring real-world task completion. OpenAI reports it performs better than humans nearly 50% of the time on an internal benchmark capturing diverse economically important tasks—an incredible claim that has yet to be reproduced. OpenAI also reports it surpasses human performance on data science tasks, and achieves state of the art results (though less than human) on tasks involving spreadsheets and web browsing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_NBd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39879533-bbcb-4b77-a1b9-67d248591bf5_1446x852.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="852" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_NBd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39879533-bbcb-4b77-a1b9-67d248591bf5_1446x852.png" width="1446" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greater autonomy introduces new risks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; OpenAI published a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-agent-system-card/" rel="rel"&gt;system card&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; detailing ChatGPT agent’s risks. ChatGPT agent has access to user data and can take actions on the web, meaning that mistakes are higher stakes. OpenAI also highlighted the risk of adversarial manipulation through prompt injection, in which malicious websites could try to manipulate ChatGPT’s behavior, such as to reveal personal information about the user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT agent poses ‘high’ biological and chemical risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; ChatGPT agent is also the first system that OpenAI is treating as posing ‘high’ biological and chemical risk. According to the company’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework/" rel="rel"&gt;Preparedness Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, that means the system could provide meaningful assistance to non-experts in creating known biological or chemical threats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;OpenAI says it’s activated several safeguards against these risks, including “comprehensive threat modeling, dual-use refusal training, always-on classifiers and reasoning monitors, and clear enforcement pipelines.” It also launched a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/bio-bug-bounty/" rel="rel"&gt;bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for researchers to red team these safeguards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI and Google DeepMind claim gold medal-level performance on the 2025 IMO. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Friday, OpenAI also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/alexwei_/status/1946477742855532918" rel="rel"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that an experimental model had achieved gold medal-level performance on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), solving five out of six questions. (A few human competitors &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_individual_r.aspx?year=2025" rel="rel"&gt;scored&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a perfect six out of six).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gold medal-level performance on the IMO has been a major goal in AI research for years, but only recently has seemed within reach. Last year, Google’s AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/" rel="rel"&gt;achieved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; silver medal-level performance on the 2024 IMO, making gold-level performance this year plausible. On Monday, Google &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/" rel="rel"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that its own reasoning LLM had achieved gold medal-level performance on the 2025 IMO, also solving five out of six questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI and Google used general reasoning LLMs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Where the capabilities of Google’s AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 systems were narrowly focused on IMO-style math questions, OpenAI’s model is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1946478250974200272" rel="rel"&gt;apparently&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; not IMO-specific (or even math-specific), but instead a general reasoning LLM allowed to think for hours at a time. OpenAI published the model’s answers on the 2025 IMO &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/aw31/openai-imo-2025-proofs/" rel="rel"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Similarly, Google’s gold-winning performance used an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think—a general reasoning model that uses natural language.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Nvidia's CEO, the US &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nvidia-china-ai-chips-h20-trump-91588c36559bc881b8e010a9ed95cf0a" rel="rel"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the sale of Nvidia's H20 chips to China.

For example, it proposes streamlining permitting for AI infrastructure (such as semiconductor manufacturing facilities, data centers, and energy infrastructure) adopting AI in the federal government and military, and funding AI research. But there’s a lot more in the plan, too: both a surprisingly strong focus on AI safety, as well as some items of concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Plan includes several policies that advance AI safety. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;While most of the plan’s policies are intended to accelerate AI development and deployment, it also correctly observes that AI development will only benefit Americans if done safely. Accordingly, it proposes several policies that advance AI safety. Some of the policies most relevant to AI safety include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest in AI Interpretability, Control, and Robustness Breakthroughs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build an AI Evaluations Ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolster Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promote Secure-By-Design AI Technologies and Applications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promote Mature Federal Capacity for AI Incident Response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strengthen AI Compute Export Control Enforcement (this proposes location verification for AI chips)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that the U.S. Government is at the Forefront of Evaluating National Security Risks in Frontier Models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest in Biosecurity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;not comprehensive, these policies are a great step in the right direction—and much better than might have been expected given the administration’s previous &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-vice-president-the-artificial-intelligence-action-summit-paris-france" rel="rel"&gt;rhetorical disregard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for AI safety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;the plan introduces sensible policies that reflect the expertise of those who developed it. However, it is also shaped by the larger policy agenda of the Trump Administration, which may conflict with AI safety goals. We discuss some areas of potential concern below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan does not want state AI legislation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;One section proposes that the Federal government “should not allow AI-related Federal funding to be directed toward states with burdensome AI regulations that waste these funds, but should also not interfere with states’ rights to pass prudent laws that are not unduly restrictive to innovation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This rule is less strict than Sen. Cruz’s failed AI regulation moratorium. But what constitutes a “burdensome” regulation will vary depending on who you ask (particularly if you ask frontier AI companies). In response to the plan, both Congressional Democrats and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=8605" rel="rel"&gt;expressed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/repmtg/status/1948400163875152237" rel="rel"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; about stifling state AI regulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan has a partisan view on what constitutes ideological bias.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; In a section on ensuring that AI “objectively reflects truth,” one policy instructs NIST to “revise the NIST AI Risk Management Framework to eliminate references to misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A policy to promote objectivity in AI models could be great. However, that policy could itself be weaponized to promote ideological ends. In their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=8605" rel="rel"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Congressional Democrats wrote that “we support true AI neutrality—AI models trained on facts and science—but the administration's fixation on ‘anti-woke’ inputs is definitionally not neutral.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan endorses open-weight models.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; It writes that, “while the decision of whether and how to release an open or closed model is fundamentally up to the developer, the Federal government should create a supportive environment for open models.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraging US companies to release open-weight models with dangerous capabilities would be a bad policy. But the specific policies the plan lists stop short of that—they mostly just provide resources to academic researchers (who are unlikely to develop frontier models) through the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan forgoes AI nonproliferation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The plan argues that the US “must meet global demand for AI by exporting its full AI technology stack—hardware, models, software, applications, and standards—to all countries willing to join America’s AI alliance.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This plan’s rationale for this policy is that countries might otherwise look to acquire Chinese AI exports. However, it also continues the Trump Administration's reversal of the Biden-era policy (see the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/15/2025-00636/framework-for-artificial-intelligence-diffusion" rel="rel"&gt;AI Diffusion Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) that sought to prevent the proliferation of dangerous AI capabilities abroad. While exporting American AI might strengthen the US’ position in the AI race, it also threatens to proliferate dangerous AI capabilities to malicious actors if the US does not ensure that other states implement robust security standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan advances a zero-sum race narrative. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kratsios, Sacks, and Rubio write that the promise of AI “is ours to seize, or to lose.” That is, they assume that the alternative to “AI dominance” is to give up AI’s benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This argument is misleading—or at least underdeveloped. While there are reasons to support a US lead in AI, AI progress has the potential to benefit Americans whether or not the US “dominates” international AI development. Historically, general purpose technologies like AI &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691260341/technology-and-the-rise-of-great-powers" rel="rel"&gt;diffuse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; across national boundaries. For example, technologies electricity and the internet have benefited people around the world, and not just within the nations that led their development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The real motivation behind the AI race narrative in Washington is not seizing AI’s benefits, but rather competition over the balance of international power between the US and China. While there are reasons to be concerned about AI development dominated by China, racing towards US dominance is not the only alternative—and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/why-racing-to-artificial-superintelligence-would-undermine-americas-national-security" rel="rel"&gt;creates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; its own risks. In order to preserve international security, the US will need to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationalsecurity.ai/chapter/deterrence-with-mutual-assured-ai-malfunction-maim" rel="rel"&gt;proactively manage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—rather than just accelerate—a US-China AI race.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Thursday, OpenAI &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/" rel="rel"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a new agent mode for ChatGPT, which integrates Operator, Deep Research, and chatbot functionality into a unified system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system, ‘ChatGPT agent,’ has access to its own virtual computer, and OpenAI highlights that it can book flights and reservations, create slides and spreadsheets, and make online purchases. It can also connect to users’ personal accounts, for example, Google Calendar, Gmail, and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT agent achieves SOTA performance on HLE and FrontierMath.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; ChatGPT agent’s capabilities extend beyond basic online automation—it achieves SOTA performance on several benchmarks measuring expert-level knowledge and reasoning. For example, ChatGPT agent gets 23% on Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), when it does not use tools. When it uses tools like browsers and computer code, it gets 41.6%. This is similar to Grok 4, which gets 25.4% on HLE without tools and 44.4% with tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YR3_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c045cf-daf7-4254-8cdc-4dd861f2c397_884x802.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="802" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YR3_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c045cf-daf7-4254-8cdc-4dd861f2c397_884x802.png" width="884" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;also evaluated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;ChatGPT agent against benchmarks measuring real-world task completion. OpenAI reports it performs better than humans nearly 50% of the time on an internal benchmark capturing diverse economically important tasks—an incredible claim that has yet to be reproduced. OpenAI also reports it surpasses human performance on data science tasks, and achieves state of the art results (though less than human) on tasks involving spreadsheets and web browsing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_NBd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39879533-bbcb-4b77-a1b9-67d248591bf5_1446x852.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="852" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_NBd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39879533-bbcb-4b77-a1b9-67d248591bf5_1446x852.png" width="1446" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greater autonomy introduces new risks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; OpenAI published a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-agent-system-card/" rel="rel"&gt;system card&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; detailing ChatGPT agent’s risks. ChatGPT agent has access to user data and can take actions on the web, meaning that mistakes are higher stakes. OpenAI also highlighted the risk of adversarial manipulation through prompt injection, in which malicious websites could try to manipulate ChatGPT’s behavior, such as to reveal personal information about the user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT agent poses ‘high’ biological and chemical risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; ChatGPT agent is also the first system that OpenAI is treating as posing ‘high’ biological and chemical risk. According to the company’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework/" rel="rel"&gt;Preparedness Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, that means the system could provide meaningful assistance to non-experts in creating known biological or chemical threats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;OpenAI says it’s activated several safeguards against these risks, including “comprehensive threat modeling, dual-use refusal training, always-on classifiers and reasoning monitors, and clear enforcement pipelines.” It also launched a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/bio-bug-bounty/" rel="rel"&gt;bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for researchers to red team these safeguards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI and Google DeepMind claim gold medal-level performance on the 2025 IMO. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Friday, OpenAI also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/alexwei_/status/1946477742855532918" rel="rel"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that an experimental model had achieved gold medal-level performance on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), solving five out of six questions. (A few human competitors &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_individual_r.aspx?year=2025" rel="rel"&gt;scored&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a perfect six out of six).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gold medal-level performance on the IMO has been a major goal in AI research for years, but only recently has seemed within reach. Last year, Google’s AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/" rel="rel"&gt;achieved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; silver medal-level performance on the 2024 IMO, making gold-level performance this year plausible. On Monday, Google &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/" rel="rel"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that its own reasoning LLM had achieved gold medal-level performance on the 2025 IMO, also solving five out of six questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI and Google used general reasoning LLMs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Where the capabilities of Google’s AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 systems were narrowly focused on IMO-style math questions, OpenAI’s model is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1946478250974200272" rel="rel"&gt;apparently&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; not IMO-specific (or even math-specific), but instead a general reasoning LLM allowed to think for hours at a time. OpenAI published the model’s answers on the 2025 IMO &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/aw31/openai-imo-2025-proofs/" rel="rel"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Similarly, Google’s gold-winning performance used an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think—a general reasoning model that uses natural language.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Nvidia's CEO, the US &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nvidia-china-ai-chips-h20-trump-91588c36559bc881b8e010a9ed95cf0a" rel="rel"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the sale of Nvidia's H20 chips to China.
