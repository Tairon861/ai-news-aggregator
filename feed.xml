At the Keck Observatory, in Hawaii, just as many segments make up a mirror that spans 33 feet, reflecting images of uncharted worlds for her to study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jensen-Clem, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, works with the Keck Observatory to figure out how to detect new planets without leaving our own. Typically, this pursuit faces an array of obstacles: Wind, fluctuations in atmospheric density and temperature, or even a misaligned telescope mirror can create a glare from a star’s light that obscures the view of what’s around it, rendering any planets orbiting the star effectively invisible. And what light Earth’s atmosphere doesn’t obscure, it absorbs. That’s why researchers who study these distant worlds often work with space telescopes that circumvent Earth’s pesky atmosphere entirely, such as the $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there’s another way over these hurdles. At her lab among the redwoods, Jensen-Clem and her students experiment with new technologies and software to help Keck’s primary honeycomb mirror and its smaller, “deformable” mirror see more clearly. Using measurements from atmospheric sensors, deformable mirrors are designed to adjust shape rapidly, so they can correct for distortions caused by Earth’s atmosphere on the fly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This general imaging technique, called adaptive optics, has been common practice since the 1990s. But Jensen-Clem is looking to level up the game with extreme adaptive optics technologies, which are aimed to create the highest image quality over a small field of view. Her group, in particular, does so by tackling issues involving wind or the primary mirror itself. The goal is to focus starlight so precisely that a planet can be visible even if its host star is a million to a billion times brighter.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In April, she and her former collaborator Maaike van Kooten were named co-recipients of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation’s New Horizons in Physics Prize. The prize announcement says they earned this early-career research award for their potential “to enable the direct detection of the smallest exo­planets” through a repertoire of methods the two women have spent their careers developing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In July, Jensen-Clem was also announced as a member of a new committee for the Habitable Worlds Observatory, a concept for a NASA space telescope that would spend its career on the prowl for signs of life in the universe. She’s tasked with defining the mission’s scientific goals by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Keck Observatory’s 10-meter primary mirror features a honeycomb structure with 36 individual mirror segments." class="wp-image-1125204" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Web_Keck-Primary-Mirror-Ethan-Tweedie.jpg?w=1800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Keck Observatory’s 10-meter primary mirror features a honeycomb structure with 36 individual mirror segments.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ETHAN TWEEDIE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In adaptive optics, we spend a lot of time on simulations, or in the lab,” Jensen-Clem says. “It’s been a long road to see that I’ve actually made things better at the observatory in the past few years.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jensen-Clem has long appreciated astronomy for its more mind-bending qualities. In seventh grade, she became fascinated by how time slows down near a black hole when her dad, an aerospace engineer, explained that concept to her. After starting her bachelor’s degree at MIT in 2008, she became taken with how a distant star can seem to disappear—either suddenly winking out or gently fading away, depending on the kind of object that passes in front of it. “It wasn’t quite exoplanet science, but there was a lot of overlap,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If you just look up at the night sky and see stars twinkling, it’s happening fast. So we have to go fast too.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During this time, Jensen-Clem began sowing the seeds for one of her prize-winning methods after her teaching assistant recommended that she apply for an internship at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There, she worked on a setup that could perfect the orientation of a large mirror. Such mirrors are more difficult to realign than the smaller, deformable ones, whose shape-changing segments cater to Earth’s fluctuating atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“At the time, we were saying, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be really cool to install one of these at Keck Observatory?’” Jensen-Clem says. The idea stuck around. She even wrote about it in a fellowship application when she was gearing up to start her graduate work at Caltech. And after years of touch-and-go development, Jensen-Clem succeeded in installing the system—which uses a technology called a Zernike wavefront sensor—on Keck’s primary mirror about a year ago. “My work as a college intern is finally done,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The system, which is currently used for occasional recalibrations rather than continuous adjustments, includes a special kind of glass plate that bends the light rays from the mirror to reveal a specific pattern. The detector can pick up a hairbreadth misalignment in that picture: If one hexagon is pushed too far back or forward, its brightness changes. Even the tiniest misalignment is important to correct, because “when you’re studying a faint object, suddenly you’re much more susceptible to little mistakes,” Jensen-Clem says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She has also been working to perfect the craft of molding Keck’s deformable mirror. This instrument, which reflects light that’s been rerouted from the primary mirror, is much smaller—only six inches wide—and is designed to reposition as often as 2,000 times a second to combat atmospheric turbulence and create the clearest picture possible. “If you just look up at the night sky and see stars twinkling, it’s happening fast. So we have to go fast too,” Jensen-Clem says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even at this rapid rate of readjustment, there’s still a lag. The deformable mirror is usually about one millisecond behind the actual outdoor conditions at any given time. “When the [adaptive optics] system can’t keep up,&amp;nbsp;then you aren’t going to get the best resolution,” says van Kooten, Jensen-Clem’s former collaborator, who is now at the National Research Council Canada. This lag has proved especially troublesome on windy nights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jensen-Clem thought it was an unsolvable problem. “The reason we have that delay is because we need to run computations and then move the deformable mirror,” she says. “You’re never going to do those things instantaneously.”&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But while she was still a postdoc at UC Berkeley, she came across a paper that posited a solution. Its authors proposed that using previous measurements and simple algebra to predict how the atmosphere will change, rather than trying to keep up with it in real time, would yield better results. She wasn’t able to test the idea at the time, but coming to UCSC and working with Keck presented the perfect opportunity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Around this time, Jensen-Clem invited van Kooten to join her team at UCSC as a postdoc because of their shared interest in the predictive software. “I didn’t have a place to live at first, so she put me up in her guest room,” van Kooten says. “She’s just so supportive at every level.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After creating experimental software to try out at Keck, the team compared the predictive version with the more standard adaptive optics, examining how well each imaged an exoplanet without its drowning in starlight. They found that the predictive software could image even faint exoplanets two to three times more clearly. The results, which Jensen-Clem published in 2022, were part of what earned her the New Horizons in Physics Prize.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thayne Currie, an astronomer at the University of Texas, San Antonio, says that these new techniques will become especially vital as researchers build bigger and bigger ground-based facilities to capture images of exoplanets—including upcoming projects such as the Extremely Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory and the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile. “There’s an incredible amount that we’re learning&amp;nbsp;about the universe, and it is really driven by technology advances that are very, very&amp;nbsp;new,” Currie says. “Dr. Jensen-Clem’s work is an example of that kind of innovation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In May, one of Jensen-Clem’s graduate students went back to Hawaii to reinstall the predictive software at Keck. This time, the program isn’t just a trial run; it’s there to stay. The new software has shown it can refocus artificial starlight. Next, it will have to prove it can handle the real thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in about a year, Jensen-Clem and her students and colleagues will brace themselves for a flood of observations from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, which recently finished measuring the motion, temperature, and composition of billions of stars over more than a decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the project releases its next set of data—slated for December 2026—Jensen-Clem’s team aims to hunt for new exoplanetary systems using clues like the wobbles in a star’s motion caused by the gravitational tugs of planets orbiting around it. Once a system has been identified, exoplanet photographers will then be able to shoot the hidden planets using a new instrument at Keck that can reveal more about their atmospheres and temperatures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There will be a mountain of data to sort through, and an even steeper supply of starlight to refocus. Thankfully, Jensen-Clem has spent more than a decade refining just the techniques she’ll need: “This time next year,” she says, “we’ll be racing to throw all our adaptive optics tricks at these systems and detect as many of these objects as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jenna Ahart is a science journalist specializing in the physical sciences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pendant on Rebecca Jensen-Clem’s necklace is only about an inch wide, composed of 36 silver hexagons entwined in a honeycomb mosaic.

But to extract insights, there’s usually a good deal of manual work that needs to be done on raw data, either by semitechnical users (such as founders and product leaders), or dedicated – and expensive – data specialists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, to produce real value, information has to be collected, shepherded, altered, and drawn from dozens of spreadsheets and different business platforms: the organisation’s CRM, its martech stack, e-commerce system, and website data, to name a few common examples. Clearly, that’s a time consuming process, and the outcomes can be old news, rather than up-to-the-minute insights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-introducing-vibe-analytics"&gt;Introducing vibe analytics&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideal business solution would be querying real-time data using natural language (vs writing code in SQL or Python), with smart systems working in the background to correlate and parse different data sources and formats. This is vibe analysis, where users can simply ask questions in plain language and let AI do the heavy lifting. Instead of manual data-wrestling and business users spending hours uncovering insights hidden deep in datasets, they get results fast — in text, graphics, summaries, and, where needed, detailed breakdowns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast and accurate data analysis is important to every organisation, but for many, real-time insights are crucial. In the agricultural sector, for example, Lumo uses Fabi.ai’s platform to manage large fleets of IoT devices, collecting telemetry data continuously and adjusting its systems based on collated, normalised, and parsed information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using vibe analysis, Lumo sees device performance immediately, as well as trends that develop over time. It pulls in weather data, and correlates the device fleet’s performance metrics with environmental factors. The data dashboards Lumo has built are not the result of many months of work writing data integration routines and front-end coding, but are a result of vibe analysis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-under-the-hood"&gt;Getting under the hood&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sceptics of AI’s abilities often point to vibe-coding as an example of where things can go wrong, raising concerns about quality control and the “black box” nature of AI-driven analysis. Many users want visibility into how results are generated, with the option to inspect logic, tweak queries, or adjust API calls to ensure accuracy. When done well, vibe analytics addresses these concerns by combining transparency with rigour.

But to extract insights, there’s usually a good deal of manual work that needs to be done on raw data, either by semitechnical users (such as founders and product leaders), or dedicated – and expensive – data specialists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, to produce real value, information has to be collected, shepherded, altered, and drawn from dozens of spreadsheets and different business platforms: the organisation’s CRM, its martech stack, e-commerce system, and website data, to name a few common examples. Clearly, that’s a time consuming process, and the outcomes can be old news, rather than up-to-the-minute insights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-introducing-vibe-analytics"&gt;Introducing vibe analytics&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideal business solution would be querying real-time data using natural language (vs writing code in SQL or Python), with smart systems working in the background to correlate and parse different data sources and formats. This is vibe analysis, where users can simply ask questions in plain language and let AI do the heavy lifting. Instead of manual data-wrestling and business users spending hours uncovering insights hidden deep in datasets, they get results fast — in text, graphics, summaries, and, where needed, detailed breakdowns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast and accurate data analysis is important to every organisation, but for many, real-time insights are crucial. In the agricultural sector, for example, Lumo uses Fabi.ai’s platform to manage large fleets of IoT devices, collecting telemetry data continuously and adjusting its systems based on collated, normalised, and parsed information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using vibe analysis, Lumo sees device performance immediately, as well as trends that develop over time. It pulls in weather data, and correlates the device fleet’s performance metrics with environmental factors. The data dashboards Lumo has built are not the result of many months of work writing data integration routines and front-end coding, but are a result of vibe analysis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-under-the-hood"&gt;Getting under the hood&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sceptics of AI’s abilities often point to vibe-coding as an example of where things can go wrong, raising concerns about quality control and the “black box” nature of AI-driven analysis. Many users want visibility into how results are generated, with the option to inspect logic, tweak queries, or adjust API calls to ensure accuracy. When done well, vibe analytics addresses these concerns by combining transparency with rigour. Natural language inputs and modular build methods make it accessible to semitechnical users (such as founders and product leaders), while the underlying systems meet the accuracy and reliability standards expected by technical teams. This means users can trust the output whether they’re working independently or in collaboration with data scientists and developers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed specifically for both data experts and semitechnical data users, Fabi is a generative BI platform that brings vibe analysis done right to life.

Yet the launch also arrives amid unusual turbulence, as CEO Marc Benioff faces &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/11/slap-in-the-face-marc-benioffs-trump-turn-stuns-san-francisco-00604421"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fierce backlash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for recent comments &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/marc-benioff-san-francisco-guard.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;supporting President Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and suggesting National Guard troops should patrol San Francisco streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why 95% of enterprise AI projects never launch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are enormous. While companies have rushed to experiment with AI following ChatGPT&amp;#x27;s emergence two years ago, most enterprise deployments have stalled before reaching production, according to &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent MIT research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Salesforce executives cited extensively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Customers have invested a lot in AI, but they&amp;#x27;re not getting the value,&amp;quot; said Srini Tallapragada, Salesforce&amp;#x27;s president and chief engineering and customer success officer. &amp;quot;95% of enterprise AI pilots fail before production. It&amp;#x27;s not because of lack of intent. People want to do this. Everybody understands the power of the technology. But why is it so hard?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, according to Tallapragada, is that AI tools remain disconnected from enterprise workflows, data, and governance systems. &amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re writing prompts, prompts, you&amp;#x27;re getting frustrated because the context is not there,&amp;quot; he said, describing what he called a &amp;quot;prompt doom loop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s solution is a deeply integrated platform connecting what it calls four ingredients: the Agentforce 360 agent platform, Data 360 for unified data access, Customer 360 apps containing business logic, and Slack as the &amp;quot;conversational interface&amp;quot; where humans and agents collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Slack becomes the front door to Salesforce&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant strategic shift is the elevation of &lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Slack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — acquired by Salesforce in 2019 for &lt;a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-slack"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$27.7 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — as the primary interface for Salesforce itself. The company is effectively reimagining its traditional Lightning interface around Slack channels, where sales deals, service cases, and data insights will surface conversationally rather than through forms and dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Imagine that you maybe don&amp;#x27;t log into Salesforce, you don&amp;#x27;t see Salesforce, but it&amp;#x27;s there. It&amp;#x27;s coming to you in Slack, because that&amp;#x27;s where you&amp;#x27;re getting your work done,&amp;quot; Harris explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy includes embedding Salesforce&amp;#x27;s Agentforce agents for sales, IT service, HR service, and analytics directly into Slack, alongside a completely rebuilt Slackbot that acts as a personal AI companion. The company is also launching &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/channel-expert"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Channel Expert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; an always-on agent that provides instant answers from channel conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable third-party AI tools to access Slack&amp;#x27;s conversational data, Salesforce is releasing a &lt;a href="https://slack.dev/secure-data-connectivity-for-the-modern-ai-era/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Real-Time Search API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://slack.dev/secure-data-connectivity-for-the-modern-ai-era/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Model Context Protocol server&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Partners including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity, Writer, Dropbox, Notion, and Cursor are building agents that will live natively in Slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The best way to see the power of the platform is through the AI apps and agents already being built,&amp;quot; Rob Seaman, a Salesforce executive, said during a technical briefing, citing examples of startups &amp;quot;achieving tens of thousands of customers that have it installed in 120 days or less.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Voice and IT service take aim at new markets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Slack integration, Salesforce announced major expansions into voice-based interactions and employee service. &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/agentforce-voice-solutions-launch/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agentforce Voice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, now generally available, transforms traditional IVR systems into natural conversations that can update CRM records, trigger workflows, and seamlessly hand off to human agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IT Service offering represents Salesforce&amp;#x27;s most direct challenge to &lt;a href="https://www.servicenow.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ServiceNow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the market leader. Mudhu Sudhakar, who joined Salesforce two months ago as senior vice president for IT and HR Service, positioned the product as a fundamental reimagining of employee support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Legacy IT service management is very portals, forms, tickets focused, manual process,&amp;quot; Sudhakar said. &amp;quot;What we had a few key tenets: conversation first and agent first, really focused on having a conversational experience for the people requesting the support and for the people providing the support.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IT Service platform includes what Salesforce describes as 25+ specialized agents and 100+ pre-built workflows and connectors that can handle everything from password resets to complex incident management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early customers report dramatic efficiency gains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer results suggest the approach is gaining traction. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reddit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reduced average support resolution time from 8.9 minutes to 1.4 minutes — an 84% improvement — while deflecting 46% of cases entirely to AI agents. &amp;quot;This efficiency has allowed us to provide on-demand help for complex tasks and boost advertiser satisfaction scores by 20%,&amp;quot; said John Thompson, Reddit&amp;#x27;s VP of sales strategy and operations, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://engine.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Engine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a travel management company, reduced average handle time by 15%, saving over $2 million annually. &lt;a href="https://www.opentable.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenTable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; resolved 70% of restaurant and diner inquiries autonomously. And 1-800Accountant achieved a 90% case deflection rate during the critical tax week period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s own internal deployments may be most telling. Tallapragada&amp;#x27;s customer success organization now handles 1.8 million AI-powered conversations weekly, with metrics published at &lt;a href="http://help.salesforce.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;help.salesforce.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showing how many agents answer versus escalating to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more significantly, Salesforce has deployed AI-powered sales development representatives to follow up on leads that would previously have gone uncontacted due to cost constraints. &amp;quot;Now, Agentforce has an SDR which is doing thousands of leads following up,&amp;quot; Tallapragada explained. The company also increased proactive customer outreach by 40% by shifting staff from reactive support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The trust layer problem enterprises can&amp;#x27;t ignore&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given enterprise concerns about AI reliability, Salesforce has invested heavily in what it calls the &amp;quot;trust layer&amp;quot; — audit trails, compliance checks, and observability tools that let organizations monitor agent behavior at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You should think of an agent as a human. Digital labor. You need to manage performance just like a human. And you need these audit trails,&amp;quot; Tallapragada explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company encountered this challenge firsthand when its own agent deployment scaled. &amp;quot;When we started at Agentforce at Salesforce, we would track every message, which is great until 1,000, 3,000,&amp;quot; Tallapragada said. &amp;quot;Once you have a million chats, there&amp;#x27;s no human, we cannot do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform now includes &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/crm/salesforce-teases-a-new-agentforce-builder-announces-more-additions-to-the-platform/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agentforce Grid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; for searching across millions of conversations to identify and fix problematic patterns. The company also introduced Agent Script, a new scripting language that allows developers to define precise guardrails and deterministic controls for agent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Data infrastructure gets a major upgrade&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlying the agent capabilities is significant infrastructure investment. Salesforce&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-exactly-is-salesforce-customer-360/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data 360&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; includes &amp;quot;Intelligent Context,&amp;quot; which automatically extracts structured information from unstructured content like PDFs, diagrams, and flowcharts using what the company describes as &amp;quot;AI-powered unstructured data pipelines.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also collaborating with &lt;a href="https://www.databricks.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Databricks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.getdbt.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dbt Labs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Snowflake&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the &amp;quot;Universal Semantic Interchange,&amp;quot; an attempt to standardize how different platforms define business metrics. The pending $8 billion acquisition of Informatica, expected to close soon, will expand metadata management capabilities across the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The competitive landscape keeps intensifying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s aggressive AI agent push comes as virtually every major enterprise software vendor pursues similar strategies. Microsoft has embedded Copilot across its product line, Google offers agent capabilities through Vertex AI and Gemini, and ServiceNow has launched its own agentic offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how Salesforce&amp;#x27;s announcement compared to &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-dev-day-2025-chatgpt-becomes-the-new-app-store-and-hardware-is-coming"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&amp;#x27;s recent releases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tallapragada emphasized that customers will use multiple AI tools simultaneously. &amp;quot;Most of the time I&amp;#x27;m seeing they&amp;#x27;re using OpenAI, they&amp;#x27;re using Gemini, they&amp;#x27;re using Anthropic, just like Salesforce, we use all three,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real differentiation, executives argued, lies not in the AI models but in the integration with business processes and data. Harris framed the competition in terms familiar from Salesforce&amp;#x27;s founding: &amp;quot;26 years ago, we just said, let&amp;#x27;s make Salesforce automation as easy as buying a book on Amazon.com. We&amp;#x27;re doing that same thing. We want to make agentic AI as easy as buying a book on Amazon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s customer success stories are impressive but remain a small fraction of its customer base. With 150,000 Salesforce customers and one million Slack customers, the 12,000 Agentforce deployments represent roughly 8% penetration — strong for a one-year-old product line, but hardly ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s stock, down &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-stock-trades-near-52-132500685.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;roughly 28% year to date&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-crm-ai-dreamforce/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Relative Strength rating of just 15&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests investors remain skeptical. This week&amp;#x27;s Dreamforce demonstrations — and the months of customer deployments that follow — will begin to provide answers to whether Salesforce can finally move enterprise AI from pilots to production at scale, or whether the &amp;quot;$7 billion business&amp;quot; remains more aspiration than reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

It&amp;#x27;s not because of lack of intent. People want to do this. Everybody understands the power of the technology. But why is it so hard?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, according to Tallapragada, is that AI tools remain disconnected from enterprise workflows, data, and governance systems. &amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re writing prompts, prompts, you&amp;#x27;re getting frustrated because the context is not there,&amp;quot; he said, describing what he called a &amp;quot;prompt doom loop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s solution is a deeply integrated platform connecting what it calls four ingredients: the Agentforce 360 agent platform, Data 360 for unified data access, Customer 360 apps containing business logic, and Slack as the &amp;quot;conversational interface&amp;quot; where humans and agents collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Slack becomes the front door to Salesforce&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant strategic shift is the elevation of &lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Slack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — acquired by Salesforce in 2019 for &lt;a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-slack"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$27.7 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — as the primary interface for Salesforce itself. The company is effectively reimagining its traditional Lightning interface around Slack channels, where sales deals, service cases, and data insights will surface conversationally rather than through forms and dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Imagine that you maybe don&amp;#x27;t log into Salesforce, you don&amp;#x27;t see Salesforce, but it&amp;#x27;s there. It&amp;#x27;s coming to you in Slack, because that&amp;#x27;s where you&amp;#x27;re getting your work done,&amp;quot; Harris explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy includes embedding Salesforce&amp;#x27;s Agentforce agents for sales, IT service, HR service, and analytics directly into Slack, alongside a completely rebuilt Slackbot that acts as a personal AI companion. The company is also launching &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/channel-expert"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Channel Expert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; an always-on agent that provides instant answers from channel conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable third-party AI tools to access Slack&amp;#x27;s conversational data, Salesforce is releasing a &lt;a href="https://slack.dev/secure-data-connectivity-for-the-modern-ai-era/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Real-Time Search API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://slack.dev/secure-data-connectivity-for-the-modern-ai-era/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Model Context Protocol server&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Partners including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity, Writer, Dropbox, Notion, and Cursor are building agents that will live natively in Slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The best way to see the power of the platform is through the AI apps and agents already being built,&amp;quot; Rob Seaman, a Salesforce executive, said during a technical briefing, citing examples of startups &amp;quot;achieving tens of thousands of customers that have it installed in 120 days or less.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Voice and IT service take aim at new markets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Slack integration, Salesforce announced major expansions into voice-based interactions and employee service. &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/agentforce-voice-solutions-launch/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agentforce Voice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, now generally available, transforms traditional IVR systems into natural conversations that can update CRM records, trigger workflows, and seamlessly hand off to human agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IT Service offering represents Salesforce&amp;#x27;s most direct challenge to &lt;a href="https://www.servicenow.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ServiceNow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the market leader. Mudhu Sudhakar, who joined Salesforce two months ago as senior vice president for IT and HR Service, positioned the product as a fundamental reimagining of employee support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Legacy IT service management is very portals, forms, tickets focused, manual process,&amp;quot; Sudhakar said. &amp;quot;What we had a few key tenets: conversation first and agent first, really focused on having a conversational experience for the people requesting the support and for the people providing the support.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IT Service platform includes what Salesforce describes as 25+ specialized agents and 100+ pre-built workflows and connectors that can handle everything from password resets to complex incident management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early customers report dramatic efficiency gains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer results suggest the approach is gaining traction. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reddit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reduced average support resolution time from 8.9 minutes to 1.4 minutes — an 84% improvement — while deflecting 46% of cases entirely to AI agents. &amp;quot;This efficiency has allowed us to provide on-demand help for complex tasks and boost advertiser satisfaction scores by 20%,&amp;quot; said John Thompson, Reddit&amp;#x27;s VP of sales strategy and operations, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://engine.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Engine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a travel management company, reduced average handle time by 15%, saving over $2 million annually. &lt;a href="https://www.opentable.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenTable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; resolved 70% of restaurant and diner inquiries autonomously. And 1-800Accountant achieved a 90% case deflection rate during the critical tax week period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s own internal deployments may be most telling. Tallapragada&amp;#x27;s customer success organization now handles 1.8 million AI-powered conversations weekly, with metrics published at &lt;a href="http://help.salesforce.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;help.salesforce.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showing how many agents answer versus escalating to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more significantly, Salesforce has deployed AI-powered sales development representatives to follow up on leads that would previously have gone uncontacted due to cost constraints. &amp;quot;Now, Agentforce has an SDR which is doing thousands of leads following up,&amp;quot; Tallapragada explained. The company also increased proactive customer outreach by 40% by shifting staff from reactive support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The trust layer problem enterprises can&amp;#x27;t ignore&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given enterprise concerns about AI reliability, Salesforce has invested heavily in what it calls the &amp;quot;trust layer&amp;quot; — audit trails, compliance checks, and observability tools that let organizations monitor agent behavior at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You should think of an agent as a human. Digital labor. You need to manage performance just like a human. And you need these audit trails,&amp;quot; Tallapragada explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company encountered this challenge firsthand when its own agent deployment scaled. &amp;quot;When we started at Agentforce at Salesforce, we would track every message, which is great until 1,000, 3,000,&amp;quot; Tallapragada said. &amp;quot;Once you have a million chats, there&amp;#x27;s no human, we cannot do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform now includes &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/crm/salesforce-teases-a-new-agentforce-builder-announces-more-additions-to-the-platform/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agentforce Grid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; for searching across millions of conversations to identify and fix problematic patterns. The company also introduced Agent Script, a new scripting language that allows developers to define precise guardrails and deterministic controls for agent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Data infrastructure gets a major upgrade&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlying the agent capabilities is significant infrastructure investment. Salesforce&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-exactly-is-salesforce-customer-360/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data 360&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; includes &amp;quot;Intelligent Context,&amp;quot; which automatically extracts structured information from unstructured content like PDFs, diagrams, and flowcharts using what the company describes as &amp;quot;AI-powered unstructured data pipelines.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also collaborating with &lt;a href="https://www.databricks.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Databricks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.getdbt.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dbt Labs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Snowflake&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the &amp;quot;Universal Semantic Interchange,&amp;quot; an attempt to standardize how different platforms define business metrics. The pending $8 billion acquisition of Informatica, expected to close soon, will expand metadata management capabilities across the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The competitive landscape keeps intensifying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s aggressive AI agent push comes as virtually every major enterprise software vendor pursues similar strategies. Microsoft has embedded Copilot across its product line, Google offers agent capabilities through Vertex AI and Gemini, and ServiceNow has launched its own agentic offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how Salesforce&amp;#x27;s announcement compared to &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-dev-day-2025-chatgpt-becomes-the-new-app-store-and-hardware-is-coming"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&amp;#x27;s recent releases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tallapragada emphasized that customers will use multiple AI tools simultaneously. &amp;quot;Most of the time I&amp;#x27;m seeing they&amp;#x27;re using OpenAI, they&amp;#x27;re using Gemini, they&amp;#x27;re using Anthropic, just like Salesforce, we use all three,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real differentiation, executives argued, lies not in the AI models but in the integration with business processes and data. Harris framed the competition in terms familiar from Salesforce&amp;#x27;s founding: &amp;quot;26 years ago, we just said, let&amp;#x27;s make Salesforce automation as easy as buying a book on Amazon.com. We&amp;#x27;re doing that same thing. We want to make agentic AI as easy as buying a book on Amazon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s customer success stories are impressive but remain a small fraction of its customer base. With 150,000 Salesforce customers and one million Slack customers, the 12,000 Agentforce deployments represent roughly 8% penetration — strong for a one-year-old product line, but hardly ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s stock, down &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-stock-trades-near-52-132500685.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;roughly 28% year to date&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-crm-ai-dreamforce/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Relative Strength rating of just 15&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests investors remain skeptical. This week&amp;#x27;s Dreamforce demonstrations — and the months of customer deployments that follow — will begin to provide answers to whether Salesforce can finally move enterprise AI from pilots to production at scale, or whether the &amp;quot;$7 billion business&amp;quot; remains more aspiration than reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The customer relations manager giant unveiled the new platform, branded Agentforce 360, ahead of its annual Dreamforce customer conference that kicks off October 14. This newer version of Agentforce includes new ways to instruct AI agents through text, a new platform to build and deploy agents, and new infrastructure for messaging app Slack, among others.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A notable aspect of Agentforce 360 is its new AI agent prompting tool, called Agent Script, which will be released in beta in November. Agent Script gives users the ability to program their AI agents to be more flexible and better respond to “if/then” situations. This allows AI agents to be programmed to be more predictable in less rigid situations like customer questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can tap into “reasoning” models, which claim to think before responding as opposed to responding based on patterns. Anthropic, OpenAI and Google Gemini power these “reasoning” agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Salesforce also announced it is releasing a new agent building tool, Agentforce Builder, which allows users to build, test and deploy AI agents from a singular spot. This tool, which will be released in beta in November, includes Agentforce Vibes, an enterprise-grade app vibe coding tool that Salesforce announced earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced a broader integration between Agentforce and Slack. Salesforce said its core apps, including Agenforce Sales, IT and HR, among others, will surface directly in Slack starting this month and expand through the beginning of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Slack is piloting a new version of its Slackbot chatbot that is meant to be more of a personalized AI agent that learns about its user and will offer insights and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Salesforce wants Slack to serve as an enterprise search tool in the future too and plans to launch connectors with platforms like Gmail, Outlook, and Dropbox in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This latest update from Salesforce comes at an interesting time for the enterprise AI market. Companies continue to release AI features aimed at their enterprise customers while enterprises struggle to see a return on investment for these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last week Google announced Gemini Enterprise, a suite of tools —&amp;nbsp;many of which were already available —&amp;nbsp;for building enterprise-grade AI agents, that counts Figma, Klarna and Virgin Voyages as early customers, among others.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic also started to show traction for its enterprise product, Claude Enterprise. The company announced it struck a deal with consulting giant Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to Deloitte’s 500,000 global employees — its largest enterprise deal yet. Anthropic announced a strategic partnership with IBM the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Salesforce touts that Agentforce has 12,000 customers — significantly higher than any of its competitors, according to its Agentforce press release. Early pilot customers of its Agentforce 360 upgrades include Lennar, Adecco, and Pearson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is all despite a recent MIT study found that 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail before they reach production as companies still struggle to justify spending money on these AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2172735483.jpg?resize=1200,806" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Salesforce announced Monday the latest version of its AI agent platform as the company looks to lure enterprises to its AI software in an increasingly crowded market.&lt;/p&gt;

A new paper, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08338"&gt;&lt;u&gt;LLMs Reproduce Human Purchase Intent via Semantic Similarity Elicitation of Likert Ratings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; submitted to the pre-print server arXiv on October 9th proposes an elegant solution that sidesteps this problem entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers, led by Benjamin F.

Instead of asking an LLM for a number, SSR prompts the model for a rich, textual opinion on a product. This text is then converted into a numerical vector — an &amp;quot;embedding&amp;quot; — and its similarity is measured against a set of pre-defined reference statements. For example, a response of &amp;quot;I would absolutely buy this, it&amp;#x27;s exactly what I&amp;#x27;m looking for&amp;quot; would be semantically closer to the reference statement for a &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; rating than to the statement for a &amp;quot;1.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are striking. Tested against a massive real-world dataset from a leading personal care corporation — comprising 57 product surveys and 9,300 human responses — the SSR method achieved 90% of human test-retest reliability. Crucially, the distribution of AI-generated ratings was statistically almost indistinguishable from the human panel.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The law, SB 243, is designed to protect children and vulnerable users from some of the harms associated with AI companion chatbot use. It holds companies — from the big labs like Meta and OpenAI to more focused companion startups like Character AI and Replika — legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet the law’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SB 243 was introduced in January by state senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker, and gained momentum after the&amp;nbsp;death of teenager Adam Raine, who died by suicide after a long series of suicidal conversations with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The legislation also responds to leaked&amp;nbsp;internal documents&amp;nbsp;that reportedly showed Meta’s chatbots were allowed to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children.&amp;nbsp;More recently, a Colorado family has filed suit against role-playing startup Character AI after their 13-year-old daughter took her own life following a series of problematic and sexualized conversations with the company’s chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Emerging technology like chatbots and social media can inspire, educate, and connect — but without real guardrails, technology can also exploit, mislead, and endanger our kids,” Newsom said in a statement. “We’ve seen some truly horrific and tragic examples of young people harmed by unregulated tech, and we won’t stand by while companies continue without necessary limits and accountability. We can continue to lead in AI and technology, but we must do it responsibly — protecting our children every step of the way. Our children’s safety is not for sale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SB 243 will go into effect January 1, 2026, and requires companies to implement certain features such as age verification, and warnings regarding social media and companion chatbots. The law also implements stronger penalties for those who profit from illegal deepfakes, including up to $250,000 per offense. Companies must also establish protocols to address suicide and self-harm, which will be shared with the state’s Department of Public Health alongside statistics on how the service provided users with crisis center prevention notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Per the bill’s language, platforms must also make it clear that any interactions are artificially generated, and chatbots must not represent themselves as healthcare professionals. Companies are required to offer break reminders to minors and prevent them from viewing sexually explicit images generated by the chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some companies have already begun to implement some safeguards aimed at children. For example, OpenAI recently began rolling out parental controls, content protections, and a self-harm detection system for children using ChatGPT. Character AI has said that its chatbot includes a disclaimer that all chats are AI-generated and fictionalized. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Senator Padilla told TechCrunch the bill was “a step in the right direction” towards putting guardrails in place on “an incredibly powerful technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have to move quickly to not miss windows of opportunity before they disappear,” Padilla said. “I hope that other states will see the risk. I think many do. I think this is a conversation happening all over the country, and I hope people will take action. Certainly the federal government has not, and I think we have an obligation here to protect the most vulnerable people among us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SB 243 is the second significant AI regulation to come out of California in recent weeks. On September 29th, Governor Newsom signed SB 53 into law, establishing new transparency requirements on large AI companies. The bill mandates that large AI labs, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google DeepMind, be transparent about safety protocols. It also ensures whistleblower protections for employees at those companies.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other states, like Illinois, Nevada, and Utah, have passed laws to restrict or fully ban the use of AI chatbots as a substitute for licensed mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;

Both companies are adopting Spectrum-X as part of an open networking framework designed to improve AI training efficiency and accelerate deployment across massive compute clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s founder and CEO, said trillion-parameter models are transforming data centres into “giga-scale AI factories,” adding that Spectrum-X acts as the “nervous system” connecting millions of GPUs to train the largest models ever built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle plans to use Spectrum-X Ethernet with its Vera Rubin architecture to build large-scale AI factories. Mahesh Thiagarajan, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s executive vice president, said the new setup will allow the company to connect millions of GPUs more efficiently, helping customers train and deploy new AI models faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta, meanwhile, is expanding its AI infrastructure by integrating Spectrum-X Ethernet switches into the Facebook Open Switching System (FBOSS), its in-house platform for managing network switches at scale. According to Gaya Nagarajan, Meta’s vice president of networking engineering, the company’s next-generation network must be open and efficient to support ever-larger AI models and deliver services to billions of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building flexible AI systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Joe DeLaere, who leads NVIDIA’s Accelerated Computing Solution Portfolio for Data Centre, flexibility is key as data centres grow more complex. He explained that NVIDIA’s MGX system offers a modular, building-block design that lets partners combine different CPUs, GPUs, storage, and networking components as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system also promotes interoperability, allowing organisations to use the same design across multiple generations of hardware. “It offers flexibility, faster time to market, and future readiness,” DeLaere said to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI models become larger, power efficiency has become a central challenge for data centres. DeLaere said NVIDIA is working “from chip to grid” to improve energy use and scalability, collaborating closely with power and cooling vendors to maximise performance per watt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example is the shift to 800-volt DC power delivery, which reduces heat loss and improves efficiency. The company is also introducing power-smoothing technology to reduce spikes on the electrical grid — an approach that can cut maximum power needs by up to 30 per cent, allowing more compute capacity within the same footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling up, out, and across&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s MGX system also plays a role in how data centres are scaled. Gilad Shainer, the company’s senior vice president of networking, told the media that MGX racks host both compute and switching components, supporting NVLink for scale-up connectivity and Spectrum-X Ethernet for scale-out growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that MGX can connect multiple AI data centres together as a unified system — what companies like Meta need to support massive distributed AI training operations. Depending on distance, they can link sites through dark fibre or additional MGX-based switches, enabling high-speed connections across regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s AI adoption of Spectrum-X reflects the growing importance of open networking. Shainer said the company will use FBOSS as its network operating system but noted that Spectrum-X supports several others, including Cumulus, SONiC, and Cisco’s NOS through partnerships. This flexibility allows hyperscalers and enterprises to standardise their infrastructure using the systems that best fit their environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding the AI ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA sees Spectrum-X as a way to make AI infrastructure more efficient and accessible across different scales. Shainer said the Ethernet platform was designed specifically for AI workloads like training and inference, offering up to 95 percent effective bandwidth and outperforming traditional Ethernet by a wide margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that NVIDIA’s partnerships with companies such as Cisco, xAI, Meta, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are helping to bring Spectrum-X to a broader range of environments — from hyperscalers to enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for Vera Rubin and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeLaere said NVIDIA’s upcoming Vera Rubin architecture is expected to be commercially available in the second half of 2026, with the Rubin CPX product arriving by year’s end. Both will work alongside Spectrum-X networking and MGX systems to support the next generation of AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also clarified that Spectrum-X and XGS share the same core hardware but use different algorithms for varying distances — Spectrum-X for inside data centres and XGS for inter–data centre communication. This approach minimises latency and allows multiple sites to operate together as a single large AI supercomputer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborating across the power chain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the 800-volt DC transition, NVIDIA is working with partners from chip level to grid. The company is collaborating with Onsemi and Infineon on power components, with Delta, Flex, and Lite-On at the rack level, and with Schneider Electric and Siemens on data centre designs. A technical white paper detailing this approach will be released at the OCP Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeLaere described this as a “holistic design from silicon to power delivery,” ensuring all systems work seamlessly together in high-density AI environments that companies like Meta and Oracle operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance advantages for hyperscalers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spectrum-X Ethernet was built specifically for distributed computing and AI workloads. Shainer said it offers adaptive routing and telemetry-based congestion control to eliminate network hotspots and deliver stable performance. These features enable higher training and inference speeds while allowing multiple workloads to run simultaneously without interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Spectrum-X is the only Ethernet technology proven to scale at extreme levels, helping organisations get the best performance and return on their GPU investments. For hyperscalers such as Meta, that scalability helps manage growing AI training demands and keep infrastructure efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware and software working together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While NVIDIA’s focus is often on hardware, DeLaere said software optimisation is equally important. The company continues to improve performance through co-design — aligning hardware and software development to maximise efficiency for AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is investing in FP4 kernels, frameworks such as Dynamo and TensorRT-LLM, and algorithms like speculative decoding to improve throughput and AI model performance. These updates, he said, ensure that systems like Blackwell continue to deliver better results over time for hyperscalers such as Meta that rely on consistent AI performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Networking for the trillion-parameter era&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spectrum-X platform — which includes Ethernet switches and SuperNICs — is NVIDIA’s first Ethernet system purpose-built for AI workloads. It’s designed to link millions of GPUs efficiently while maintaining predictable performance across AI data centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With congestion-control technology achieving up to 95 per cent data throughput, Spectrum-X marks a major leap over standard Ethernet, which typically reaches only about 60 per cent due to flow collisions. Its XGS technology also supports long-distance AI data centre links, connecting facilities across regions into unified “AI super factories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tying together NVIDIA’s full stack — GPUs, CPUs, NVLink, and software — Spectrum-X provides the consistent performance needed to support trillion-parameter models and the next wave of generative AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Nvidia)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: OpenAI and Nvidia plan $100B chip deal for AI future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-109849" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA will unveil specs of the NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL144 MGX-generation open architecture rack servers, which more than 50 MGX partners are gearing up for along with ecosystem support for NVIDIA Kyber, which connects 576 Rubin Ultra GPUs, built to support increasing inference demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 20-plus industry partners are showcasing new silicon, components, power systems and support for the next-generation, 800-volt direct current (VDC) data centers of the gigawatt era that will support the NVIDIA Kyber rack architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foxconn provided details on its 40-megawatt Taiwan data center, Kaohsiung-1, being built for 800 VDC. CoreWeave, Lambda, Nebius, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Together AI are among other industry pioneers designing for 800-volt data centers. In addition, Vertiv unveiled its space-, cost- and energy-efficient 800 VDC MGX reference architecture, a complete power and cooling infrastructure architecture. HPE is announcing product support for NVIDIA Kyber as well as NVIDIA Spectrum-XGS Ethernet scale-across technology, part of the Spectrum-X Ethernet platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to 800 VDC infrastructure from traditional 415 or 480 VAC three-phase systems offers increased scalability, improved energy efficiency, reduced materials usage and higher capacity for performance in data centers. The electric vehicle and solar industries have already adopted 800 VDC infrastructure for similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open Compute Project, founded by Meta, is an industry consortium of hundreds of computing and networking providers and more focused on redesigning hardware technology to efficiently support the growing demands on compute infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vera Rubin NVL144: Designed to Scale for AI Factories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vera Rubin NVL144 MGX compute tray offers an energy-efficient, 100% liquid-cooled, modular design. Its central printed circuit board midplane replaces traditional cable-based connections for faster assembly and serviceability, with modular expansion bays for NVIDIA ConnectX-9 800GB/s networking and NVIDIA Rubin CPX for massive-context inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL144 offers a major leap in accelerated computing architecture and AI performance. It’s built for advanced reasoning engines and the demands of AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its fundamental design lives in the MGX rack architecture and will be supported by 50+ MGX system and component partners. NVIDIA plans to contribute the upgraded rack as well as the compute tray innovations as an open standard for the OCP consortium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its standards for compute trays and racks enable partners to mix and match in modular fashion and scale faster with the architecture. The Vera Rubin NVL144 rack design features energy-efficient 45°C liquid cooling, a new liquid-cooled busbar for higher performance and 20x more energy storage to keep power steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MGX upgrades to compute tray and rack architecture boost AI factory performance while simplifying assembly, enabling a rapid ramp-up to gigawatt-scale AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is a leading contributor to OCP standards across multiple hardware generations, including key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system electro-mechanical design. The same MGX rack footprint supports GB300 NVL72 and will support Vera Rubin NVL144, Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX and Vera Rubin CPX for higher performance and fast deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;If You Build It, They Will Come: NVIDIA Kyber Rack Server Generation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCP ecosystem is also preparing for NVIDIA Kyber, featuring innovations in 800 VDC power delivery, liquid cooling and mechanical design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These innovations will support the move to rack server generation NVIDIA Kyber — the successor to NVIDIA Oberon — which will house a high-density platform of 576 NVIDIA Rubin Ultra GPUs by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most effective way to counter the challenges of high-power distribution is to increase the voltage. Transitioning from a traditional 415 or 480 VAC three-phase system to an 800 VDC architecture offers various benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition afoot enables rack server partners to move from 54 VDC in-rack components to 800 VDC for better results. An ecosystem of direct current infrastructure providers, power system and cooling partners, and silicon makers — all aligned on open standards for the MGX rack server reference architecture — attended the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Kyber is engineered to boost rack GPU density, scale up network size and maximize performance for large-scale AI infrastructure. By rotating compute blades vertically, like books on a shelf, Kyber enables up to 18 compute blades per chassis, while purpose-built NVIDIA NVLink switch blades are integrated at the back via a cable-free midplane for seamless scale-up networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 150% more power is transmitted through the same copper with 800 VDC, enabling eliminating the need for 200-kg copper busbars to feed a single rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyber will become a foundational element of hyperscale AI data centers, enabling superior performance, efficiency and reliability for state-of-the-art generative AI workloads in the coming years. NVIDIA Kyber racks offer a way for customers to reduce the amount of copper they use by the tons, leading to millions of dollars in cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;NVIDIA NVLink Fusion Ecosystem Expands&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to hardware, NVIDIA NVLink Fusion is gaining momentum, enabling companies to seamlessly integrate their semi-custom silicon into highly optimized and widely deployed data center architecture, reducing complexity and accelerating time to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel and Samsung Foundry are joining the NVLink Fusion ecosystem that includes custom silicon designers, CPU and IP partners, so that AI factories can scale up quickly to handle demanding workloads for model training and agentic AI inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As part of the recently announced NVIDIA and Intel collaboration, Intel will build x86 CPUs that integrate into NVIDIA infrastructure platforms using NVLink Fusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samsung Foundry has partnered with NVIDIA to meet growing demand for custom CPUs and custom XPUs, offering design-to-manufacturing experience for custom silicon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;It Takes an Open Ecosystem: Scaling the Next Generation of AI Factories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 NVIDIA partners are helping deliver rack servers with open standards, enabling the future gigawatt AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silicon providers&lt;/b&gt;: Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), AOS, EPC, Infineon, Innoscience, MPS, Navitas, onsemi, Power Integrations, Renesas, Richtek, ROHM, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Power system component providers&lt;/b&gt;: BizLink, Delta, Flex, GE Vernova, Lead Wealth, LITEON and Megmeet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data center power system providers&lt;/b&gt;: ABB, Eaton, GE Vernova, Heron Power, Hitachi Energy, Mitsubishi Electric, Schneider Electric, Siemens and Vertiv&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its standards for compute trays and racks enable partners to mix and match in modular fashion and scale faster with the architecture. The Vera Rubin NVL144 rack design features energy-efficient 45°C liquid cooling, a new liquid-cooled busbar for higher performance and 20x more energy storage to keep power steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MGX upgrades to compute tray and rack architecture boost AI factory performance while simplifying assembly, enabling a rapid ramp-up to gigawatt-scale AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is a leading contributor to OCP standards across multiple hardware generations, including key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system electro-mechanical design. The same MGX rack footprint supports GB300 NVL72 and will support Vera Rubin NVL144, Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX and Vera Rubin CPX for higher performance and fast deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;If You Build It, They Will Come: NVIDIA Kyber Rack Server Generation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCP ecosystem is also preparing for NVIDIA Kyber, featuring innovations in 800 VDC power delivery, liquid cooling and mechanical design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These innovations will support the move to rack server generation NVIDIA Kyber — the successor to NVIDIA Oberon — which will house a high-density platform of 576 NVIDIA Rubin Ultra GPUs by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most effective way to counter the challenges of high-power distribution is to increase the voltage. Transitioning from a traditional 415 or 480 VAC three-phase system to an 800 VDC architecture offers various benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition afoot enables rack server partners to move from 54 VDC in-rack components to 800 VDC for better results. An ecosystem of direct current infrastructure providers, power system and cooling partners, and silicon makers — all aligned on open standards for the MGX rack server reference architecture — attended the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Kyber is engineered to boost rack GPU density, scale up network size and maximize performance for large-scale AI infrastructure. By rotating compute blades vertically, like books on a shelf, Kyber enables up to 18 compute blades per chassis, while purpose-built NVIDIA NVLink switch blades are integrated at the back via a cable-free midplane for seamless scale-up networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 150% more power is transmitted through the same copper with 800 VDC, enabling eliminating the need for 200-kg copper busbars to feed a single rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyber will become a foundational element of hyperscale AI data centers, enabling superior performance, efficiency and reliability for state-of-the-art generative AI workloads in the coming years. NVIDIA Kyber racks offer a way for customers to reduce the amount of copper they use by the tons, leading to millions of dollars in cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;NVIDIA NVLink Fusion Ecosystem Expands&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to hardware, NVIDIA NVLink Fusion is gaining momentum, enabling companies to seamlessly integrate their semi-custom silicon into highly optimized and widely deployed data center architecture, reducing complexity and accelerating time to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel and Samsung Foundry are joining the NVLink Fusion ecosystem that includes custom silicon designers, CPU and IP partners, so that AI factories can scale up quickly to handle demanding workloads for model training and agentic AI inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As part of the recently announced NVIDIA and Intel collaboration, Intel will build x86 CPUs that integrate into NVIDIA infrastructure platforms using NVLink Fusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samsung Foundry has partnered with NVIDIA to meet growing demand for custom CPUs and custom XPUs, offering design-to-manufacturing experience for custom silicon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;It Takes an Open Ecosystem: Scaling the Next Generation of AI Factories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 NVIDIA partners are helping deliver rack servers with open standards, enabling the future gigawatt AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silicon providers&lt;/b&gt;: Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), AOS, EPC, Infineon, Innoscience, MPS, Navitas, onsemi, Power Integrations, Renesas, Richtek, ROHM, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments&lt;/li&gt;
