A common joke about coffee is recycled across generations of queries. Story prompts generate similar arcs. Even tasks that should yield many plausible answers—like naming U.S. states—tend to collapse into only a few. This phenomenon, known as mode collapse, arises during post-training alignment and limits the usefulness of otherwise powerful models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially when using LLMs to generate new creative works in writing, communications, strategy, or illustrations, we actually want their outputs to be&lt;i&gt; even more varied than they already are. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href="https://www.verbalized-sampling.com/"&gt;team of researchers at Northeastern University, Stanford University and West Virginia University&lt;/a&gt; have come up with an ingenuously simple method to get language and image models to generate a wider variety of responses to nearly any user prompt by &lt;b&gt;adding a single, simple sentence: &amp;quot;Generate 5 responses with their corresponding probabilities, sampled from the full distribution.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method, called &lt;i&gt;Verbalized Sampling&lt;/i&gt; (VS), helps models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini produce more diverse and human-like outputs—without retraining or access to internal parameters. It is described in a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published on the open access journal arxiv.org online in early October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When prompted in this way, the model no longer defaults to its safest, most typical output. Instead, it verbalizes its internal distribution over potential completions and samples across a wider spectrum of possibilities. This one-line change leads to substantial gains in output diversity across multiple domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Weiyan Shi, an assistant professor at Northeastern University and co-author of the paper, &lt;a href="https://x.com/shi_weiyan/status/1978511066586878305"&gt;wrote on X&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;LLMs&amp;#x27; potentials are not fully unlocked yet! As shown in our paper, prompt optimization can be guided by thinking about how LLMs are trained and aligned, and can be proved theoretically.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Models Collapse—and How VS Reverses It&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the research team, the root cause of mode collapse lies not just in algorithms like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but in the structure of human preferences. People tend to rate more familiar or typical answers as better, which nudges LLMs toward “safe” choices over diverse ones during fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this bias doesn’t erase the model’s underlying knowledge—it just suppresses it. VS works by bypassing this suppression. Instead of asking for the single most likely output, it invites the model to reveal a set of plausible responses and their relative probabilities. This distribution-level prompting restores access to the richer diversity present in the base pretraining model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real-World Performance Across Tasks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team tested Verbalized Sampling across several common use cases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creative Writing&lt;/b&gt;: In story generation, VS increased diversity scores by up to 2.1× compared to standard prompting, while maintaining quality. One story prompt—“Without a goodbye”—produced formulaic breakup scenes under direct prompting, but yielded narratives involving cosmic events, silent emails, and music stopping mid-dance when prompted via VS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dialogue Simulation&lt;/b&gt;: In persuasive dialogue tasks, VS enabled models to simulate human-like patterns, such as hesitation, resistance, and changes of mind. Donation behavior distributions under VS better aligned with real human data compared to baseline methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open-ended QA&lt;/b&gt;: When asked to enumerate valid answers (e.g., naming U.S. states), models using VS generated responses that more closely matched the diversity of real-world data. They covered a broader set of answers without sacrificing factual accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthetic Data Generation&lt;/b&gt;: When used to generate math problems for model training, VS created more varied datasets. These, in turn, improved downstream performance in competitive math benchmarks, outperforming synthetic data generated via direct prompting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tunable Diversity and Better Use of Larger Models&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A notable advantage of VS is its &lt;i&gt;tunability&lt;/i&gt;. Users can set a probability threshold in the prompt to sample from lower-probability “tails” of the model’s distribution. Lower thresholds correspond to higher diversity. This tuning can be done via prompt text alone, without changing any decoding settings like temperature or top-p.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one test using the Gemini-2.5-Flash model, diversity in story writing increased steadily as the probability threshold dropped from 1 to 0.001. The chart accompanying the study showed VS outperforming both direct and sequence-based prompting across all thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the method scales well with model size. Larger models like GPT-4.1 and Claude-4 showed even greater gains from VS compared to smaller ones. While smaller models benefitted, the improvement in diversity was roughly 1.5–2× stronger in larger counterparts—suggesting VS helps unlock more of the latent capabilities in advanced models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deployment and Availability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Verbalized Sampling method is available now as a Python package:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install verbalized-sampling&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The package includes integration with LangChain and supports a simple interface for sampling from the verbalized distribution. Users can also adjust parameters like &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; (number of responses), thresholds, and temperature to suit their applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A live Colab notebook and documentation are available under&lt;a href="https://github.com/CHATS-lab/verbalized-sampling"&gt; an enterprise friendly Apache 2.0 license &lt;/a&gt;on GitHub at: &lt;a href="https://github.com/CHATS-lab/verbalized-sampling"&gt;https://github.com/CHATS-lab/verbalized-sampling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Practical Tips and Common Issues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the method works across all major LLMs, some users may initially encounter refusals or errors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these cases, the authors suggest using the system prompt version of the template or referring to alternative formats listed on the GitHub page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some models &lt;a href="https://x.com/dch/status/1978480024866165003"&gt;interpret complex instructions as jailbreak attempts&lt;/a&gt; and refuse to comply unless the structure is clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, prompting via a system-level instruction like this improves reliability:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You are a helpful assistant. For each query, generate five responses within separate tags, each with a probability below 0.10.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This small change typically resolves any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Lightweight Fix for a Big Problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbalized Sampling represents a practical, inference-time fix to a deep limitation in how modern language models behave. It doesn’t require model retraining or internal access. It is not dependent on any one model family. And it improves not only the diversity of outputs, but their quality—as judged by both human evaluation and benchmark scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With growing interest in tools that enhance model creativity, VS is likely to see rapid adoption in domains like writing, design, simulation, education, and synthetic data generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For users and developers frustrated by the sameness of LLM responses, the fix may be as simple as changing the question.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest things about generative AI models — both large language models (LLMs) and diffusion-based image generators — is that they are &amp;quot;non-deterministic.&amp;quot; That is, despite their reputation among some critics as being &amp;quot;fancy autocorrect,&amp;quot; generative AI models actually generate their outputs by choosing from a distribution of the most probable next tokens (units of information) to fill out their response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking an LLM: &amp;quot;What is the capital of France?&amp;quot; will have it sample its probability distribution for France, capitals, cities, etc. to arrive at the answer &amp;quot;Paris.&amp;quot; But that answer could come in the format of &amp;quot;The capital of France is Paris,&amp;quot; or simply &amp;quot;Paris&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Paris, though it was Versailles at one point.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, those of us that use these models frequently day-to-day will note that sometimes, their answers can feel annoyingly repetitive or similar.

The company says it’s adding this safeguard at the request of Dr. King’s estate after some Sora users generated “disrespectful depictions” of his image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“While there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, OpenAI believes public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used,” OpenAI said in a post on X from its official newsroom account. “Authorized representatives or estate owners can request that their likeness not be used in Sora cameos.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The restriction comes just a few weeks after OpenAI launched its social video platform, Sora, which allows users to create realistic AI-generated videos resembling historical figures, their friends, and users who elect to have their likeness recreated on the platform. The launch has stirred fervent public debate around the dangers of AI-generated videos, and how platforms should implement guardrails around the technology.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Bernice King, Dr. King’s daughter, posted on Instagram last week asking people to stop sending her AI videos resembling her father. She joined Robin Williams’ daughter, who also asked Sora users to stop generating AI videos of her father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Sora users had created AI-generated videos of Dr. King making monkey noises and wrestling with another civil rights icon, Malcolm X. Scrolling through OpenAI’s Sora app, it’s easy to find crude videos resembling other historical figures, including artist Bob Ross, singer Whitney Houston, and former President John F. Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The licensor of Dr. King’s estate did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond how Sora represents humans, the launch has also raised a flurry of questions around how social media platforms should handle AI videos of copyrighted works. The Sora app is also full of videos depicting cartoons like SpongeBob, South Park, and Pokémon.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added other restrictions to Sora in weeks since its launch. Earlier in October, the company said it planned to give copyright holders more granular control over the types of AI videos that can be generated with their likeness. That may have been a response to Hollywood’s initial reaction to Sora, which was not great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As OpenAI adds restrictions to Sora, the company seems to be taking a more hands-off approach to moderating content in ChatGPT. OpenAI announced this week that it would allow adult users to have “erotic” chats with ChatGPT in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With Sora, it seems that OpenAI is grappling with the concerns that come along with AI video generation. Some OpenAI researchers publicly wrestled with questions about the company’s first AI-powered social media platform in the days after its launch, and how such a product fits into the nonprofit’s mission. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company felt “trepidation” about Sora on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, told me earlier this month that the best way to teach the world about a new technology is putting it out in the world. He said that’s what the company learned with ChatGPT, and that’s what OpenAI is finding with Sora, too. It seems the company is learning something about how to distribute this technology, as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gettyimages-80751598-e1484590456411.jpg?w=967" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI announced Thursday it paused the ability for users to generate videos resembling the late civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. using its AI video model, Sora.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As OpenAI adds restrictions to Sora, the company seems to be taking a more hands-off approach to moderating content in ChatGPT. OpenAI announced this week that it would allow adult users to have “erotic” chats with ChatGPT in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With Sora, it seems that OpenAI is grappling with the concerns that come along with AI video generation. Some OpenAI researchers publicly wrestled with questions about the company’s first AI-powered social media platform in the days after its launch, and how such a product fits into the nonprofit’s mission. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company felt “trepidation” about Sora on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, told me earlier this month that the best way to teach the world about a new technology is putting it out in the world. He said that’s what the company learned with ChatGPT, and that’s what OpenAI is finding with Sora, too. It seems the company is learning something about how to distribute this technology, as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/openai-pauses-sora-video-generations-of-martin-luther-king-jr/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 03:21:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] This startup thinks slime mold can help us design better cities (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/17/1125223/slime-design-better-cities-mireta/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4175_270bf8.png?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a yellow blob with no brain, yet some researchers believe a curious organism known as slime mold could help us build more resilient cities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Humans have been building cities for 6,000 years, but slime mold has been around for 600 million. The team behind a new startup called Mireta wants to translate the organism’s biological superpowers into algorithms that might help improve transit times, alleviate congestion, and minimize climate-related disruptions in cities worldwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mireta’s algorithm mimics how slime mold efficiently distributes resources through branching networks. The startup’s founders think this approach could help connect subway stations, design bike lanes, or optimize factory assembly lines. They claim its software can factor in flood zones, traffic patterns, budget constraints, and more.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s very rational to think that some [natural] systems or organisms have actually come up with clever solutions to problems we share,” says Raphael Kay, Mireta’s cofounder and head of design, who has a background in architecture and mechanical engineering and is currently a PhD candidate in materials science and mechanical engineering at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As urbanization continues—about 60% of the global population will live in metropolises by 2030—cities must provide critical services while facing population growth, aging infrastructure, and extreme weather caused by climate change. Kay, who has also studied how microscopic sea creatures could help researchers design zero-energy buildings, believes nature’s time-tested solutions may offer a path toward more adaptive urban systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officially known as &lt;em&gt;Physarum polycephalum,&lt;/em&gt; slime mold is neither plant, animal, nor fungus but a single-­celled organism older than dinosaurs. When searching for food, it extends tentacle-like projections in multiple directions simultaneously. It then doubles down on the most efficient paths that lead to food while abandoning less productive routes. This process creates optimized networks that balance efficiency with resilience—a sought-after quality in transportation and infrastructure systems.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The organism’s ability to find the shortest path between multiple points while maintaining backup connections has made it a favorite among researchers studying network design. Most famously, in 2010 researchers at Hokkaido University reported results from an experiment in which they dumped a blob of slime mold onto a detailed map of Tokyo’s railway system, marking major stations with oat flakes. At first the brainless organism engulfed the entire map. Days later, it had pruned itself back, leaving behind only the most efficient pathways. The result closely mirrored Tokyo’s actual rail network.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since then, researchers worldwide have used slime mold to solve mazes and even map the dark matter holding the universe together. Experts across Mexico, Great Britain, and the Iberian peninsula have tasked the organism with redesigning their roadways—though few of these experiments have translated into real-world upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Historically, researchers working with the organism would print a physical map and add slime mold onto it. But Kay believes that Mireta’s approach, which replicates slime mold’s pathway-building without requiring actual organisms, could help solve more complex problems. Slime mold is visible to the naked eye, so Kay’s team studied how the blobs behave in the lab, focusing on the key behaviors that make these organisms so good at creating efficient networks. Then they translated these behaviors into a set of rules that became an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some experts aren’t convinced. According to Geoff Boeing, an associate professor at the University of Southern California’s Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis, such algorithms don’t address “the messy realities of entering a room with a group of stakeholders and co-visioning a future for their community.” Modern urban planning problems, he says, aren’t solely technical issues: “It’s not that we don’t know how to make infrastructure networks efficient, resilient, connected—it’s that it’s politically challenging to do so.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Batty, a professor emeritus at University College London’s Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, finds the concept more promising. “There is certainly potential for exploration,” he says, noting that humans have long drawn parallels between biological systems and cities. For decades now, designers have looked to nature for ideas—think ventilation systems inspired by termite mounds or bullet trains modeled after the kingfisher’s beak.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like Boeing, Batty worries that such algorithms could reinforce top-down planning when most cities grow from the bottom up. But for Kay, the algorithm’s beauty lies in how it mimics bottom-up biological growth—like the way slime mold starts from multiple points and connects organically rather than following predetermined paths.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since launching earlier this year, Mireta, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has worked on about five projects. And slime mold is just the beginning. The team is also looking at algorithms inspired by ants, which leave chemical trails that strengthen with use and have their own decentralized solutions for network optimization. “Biology has solved just about every network problem you can imagine,” says Kay.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elissaveta M.

Some of them are finding notable success as AI artists: They are gaining huge online followings, selling their work at auction, and even having it exhibited in galleries and museums.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you need a camera, sometimes AI, and sometimes paint or pencil or any other medium,” says Jacob Adler, a musician and composer who won the top prize at the generative video company Runway’s third annual AI Film Festival for his work &lt;em&gt;Total Pixel Space.&lt;/em&gt; “It’s just one tool that is added to the creator’s toolbox.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most conspicuous features of generative AI tools is their accessibility. With no training and in very little time, you can create an image of whatever you can imagine in whatever style you desire. That’s a key reason AI art has attracted so much criticism: It’s now trivially easy to clog sites like Instagram and TikTok with vapid nonsense, and companies can generate images and video themselves instead of hiring trained artists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Henry Dauber created these visuals for a bitcoin NFT titled The Order of Satoshi, which sold at Sotheby’s for $24,000." class="wp-image-1125267" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WEB_NFTbitcoinart.png?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Henry Daubrez created these visuals for a bitcoin NFT titled &lt;em&gt;The Order of Satoshi,&lt;/em&gt; which sold at Sotheby’s for $24,000.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE ARTIST&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Henry Daubrez, an artist and designer who created the AI-generated visuals for a bitcoin NFT that sold for $24,000 at Sotheby’s and is now Google’s first filmmaker in residence, sees that accessibility as one of generative AI’s most positive attributes. People who had long since given up on creative expression, or who simply never had the time to master a medium, are now creating and sharing art, he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean the first AI-generated masterpiece could come from just anyone. “I don’t think [generative AI] is going to create an entire generation of geniuses,” says Daubrez, who has described himself as an “AI-assisted artist.” Prompting tools like DALL-E and Midjourney might not require technical finesse, but getting those tools to create something interesting, and then evaluating whether the results are any good, takes both imagination and artistic sensibility, he says: “I think we’re getting into a new generation which is going to be driven by taste.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kira Xonorika’s Trickster is the first piece to use generative AI in the Denver Art Museum’s permanent collection." class="wp-image-1125270" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WEB_cfdff3_80b997d147fb41f48b33fc748cfa8617mv2.jpg?w=1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Kira Xonorika’s &lt;em&gt;Trickster&lt;/em&gt; is the first piece to use generative AI in the Denver Art Museum’s permanent collection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE ARTIST&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even for artists who do have experience with other media, AI can be more than just a shortcut. Beth Frey, a trained fine artist who shares her AI art on an Instagram account with over 100,000 followers, was drawn to early generative AI tools because of the uncanniness of their creations—she relished the deformed hands and haunting depictions of eating. Over time, the models’ errors have been ironed out, which is part of the reason she hasn’t posted an AI-generated piece on Instagram in over a year. “The better it gets, the less interesting it is for me,” she says. “You have to work harder to get the glitch now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="ai-generated tomato head character vomits spaghetti onto its lap as it sits on a sofa" class="wp-image-1125273" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WEB_Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-11.30.52-AM.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Beth Frey’s Instagram account @sentientmuppetfactory features uncanny AI creations.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE ARTIST&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making art with AI can require relinquishing control—to the companies that update the tools, and to the tools themselves. For Kira Xonorika, a self-described “AI-collaborative artist” whose short film &lt;em&gt;Trickster&lt;/em&gt; is the first generative AI piece in the Denver Art Museum’s permanent collection, that lack of control is part of the appeal. “[What] I really like about AI is the element of unpredictability,” says Xonorika, whose work explores themes such as indigeneity and nonhuman intelligence. “If you’re open to that, it really enhances and expands ideas that you might have.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the idea of AI as a co-creator—or even simply as an artistic medium—is still a long way from widespread acceptance. To many people, “AI art” and “AI slop” remain synonymous. And so, as grateful as Daubrez is for the recognition he has received so far, he’s found that pioneering a new form of art in the face of such strong opposition is an emotional mixed bag. “As long as it’s not really accepted that AI is just a tool like any other tool and people will do whatever they want with it—and some of it might be great, some might not be—it’s still going to be sweet [and] sour,” he says.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this era of AI slop, the idea that generative AI tools like Midjourney and Runway could be used to make art can seem absurd: What possible artistic value is there to be found in the likes of Shrimp Jesus and Ballerina Cappuccina?

Over time, the models’ errors have been ironed out, which is part of the reason she hasn’t posted an AI-generated piece on Instagram in over a year. “The better it gets, the less interesting it is for me,” she says. “You have to work harder to get the glitch now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="ai-generated tomato head character vomits spaghetti onto its lap as it sits on a sofa" class="wp-image-1125273" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WEB_Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-11.30.52-AM.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Beth Frey’s Instagram account @sentientmuppetfactory features uncanny AI creations.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE ARTIST&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making art with AI can require relinquishing control—to the companies that update the tools, and to the tools themselves. For Kira Xonorika, a self-described “AI-collaborative artist” whose short film &lt;em&gt;Trickster&lt;/em&gt; is the first generative AI piece in the Denver Art Museum’s permanent collection, that lack of control is part of the appeal. “[What] I really like about AI is the element of unpredictability,” says Xonorika, whose work explores themes such as indigeneity and nonhuman intelligence. “If you’re open to that, it really enhances and expands ideas that you might have.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the idea of AI as a co-creator—or even simply as an artistic medium—is still a long way from widespread acceptance. To many people, “AI art” and “AI slop” remain synonymous. And so, as grateful as Daubrez is for the recognition he has received so far, he’s found that pioneering a new form of art in the face of such strong opposition is an emotional mixed bag. “As long as it’s not really accepted that AI is just a tool like any other tool and people will do whatever they want with it—and some of it might be great, some might not be—it’s still going to be sweet [and] sour,” he says.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/17/1125193/ai-art-artist-new-chapter/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Meta previews new parental controls for its AI experiences (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/meta-previews-new-parental-controls-for-its-ai-experiences/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2225880947.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta on Friday previewed its upcoming parental control features for teens’ conversations with AI characters on its platforms. The features, which will be rolled out next year, include the ability to block certain characters and monitor conversation topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Starting in the coming months, parents will be able to turn off chats with AI characters entirely for teens. This action won’t block access to the Meta AI chatbot — the company’s general-purpose AI chatbot — which will only discuss age-appropriate content.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Parents will also be able to turn off chats with individual characters if they prefer more selective control. Plus, they will receive information about the topics teens are discussing with AI characters and Meta AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said it plans to roll out these controls on Instagram early next year. They will be available in English in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We recognize parents already have a lot on their plates when it comes to navigating the internet safely with their teens, and we’re committed to providing them with helpful tools and resources that make things simpler for them, especially as they think about new technology like AI,” the company said in a post written by Instagram head Adam Mosseri and newly appointed Meta AI head Alexandr Wang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this week, Meta said that its content and AI experiences for teens will follow a PG-13 movie rating standard and will avoid sensitive topics such as extreme violence, nudity, and graphic drug use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company added that currently, teens are only allowed to interact with a limited number of characters that follow age-appropriate content guidelines. Parents can also set time limits on teens’ interactions with AI characters. Earlier this year, Instagram announced that it is using AI to identify attempting to skirt age limits by faking their age on the app.&lt;/p&gt;

Staff employed by the unit are being offered a voluntary retirement program as part of a broader effort to bring together the company’s various AI-related divisions, SK Telecom confirmed to TechCrunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In late September, SK Telecom announced the launch of the AI CIC (Company-in-Company) unit and confirmed that detailed organizational restructuring would be specified by the end of October,” a spokesperson at SK Telecom told TechCrunch. “This special retirement program is entirely a supportive measure and is not intended as a restructuring or downsizing measure.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The voluntary retirement program will not involve forced layoffs, and is meant to support employees whose roles, organizations or work locations may change, the spokesperson said. Employees who opt to stay with the company may be reassigned to regional offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Details of the voluntary retirement program have been communicated to staff across all experience levels, including both junior and senior employees, industry sources told TechCrunch. The AI unit has about 1,000 employees, per media reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI CIC is meant to bring together SK Telecom’s various AI-related units under a centralized organization, per the spokesperson. “This integration involves streamlining overlapping roles and functions, which may inevitably lead to changes such as role transitions, organizational realignments, or relocations,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new division will oversee the development of SK Telecom’s personal AI agent, A. (pronounced “A-dot”), its AI data center operations, enterprise AI business, as well as global AI partnerships and investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Severance packages are reportedly expected to vary based on employees’ tenure and position, but the spokesperson told TechCrunch the company has set no such internal targets. “As participation is entirely voluntary, it is difficult at this stage to predict [how many employees] it may impact on the organization as a whole,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The restructuring comes as SK Telecom seeks to streamline operations and boost efficiency, with a specific focus on AI. The company plans for the AI division to record annual revenue of ₩5 trillion (around $3.5 billion) by 2030, and expects AI-driven B2C and B2B services as well as related infrastructure to drive that growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The telecom giant recently unveiled an AI infrastructure effort, offering Nvidia Blackwell GPUs-as-a-service, and earlier this month partnered with OpenAI to develop AI data centers in southwestern Korea as part of the ‘Stargate Korea’ initiative. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image-1-‘Innovation-Gate-the-entrance-to-the-SK-booth-at-CES-2025-1.jpg?w=1198" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;South Korean telco giant SK Telecom is making big changes at its new AI division, AI CIC, just weeks after it was launched.

(AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/what-if-ai-is-the-next-dot-com-bubble/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The surge of multi-billion-dollar investments in AI has sparked growing debate over whether the industry is heading for a bubble similar to the dot-com boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are watching closely for signs that enthusiasm might be fading or that the heavy spending on infrastructure and chips is failing to deliver expected returns. A recent survey by BofA Global Research found that 54% of fund managers believe AI stocks are already in bubble territory, while 38% disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-echoes-of-the-dot-com-era"&gt;Echoes of the dot-com era&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the optimism surrounding AI, sceptics remain unconvinced of its real-world impact. Some even call it a bluff or a bubble waiting to burst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking during Cisco’s recent Virtual Media Roundtable — AI Readiness Index 2025: Readiness Leads to Value, Ben Dawson, Senior Vice President and President for Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China (APJC), compared the current wave of AI hype to the early days of the internet. He said technological shifts of this scale often follow a familiar pattern — early excitement, heavy investment, and eventual market correction before long-term value takes hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawson noted that while some AI projects or business models may not last, the overall transformation is real and lasting. He added that, much like the internet revolution, AI will permanently reshape business and society, and organisations that ignore it do so at their own risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-role-of-governments-and-global-policy"&gt;The role of governments and global policy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public policy is also shaping how the AI cycle unfolds — and how governments might cushion the risks of a potential AI bubble. As &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt; pointed out, in the US, government involvement has helped define past technology eras — often through incentives and early investments that encourage private innovation. The same pattern is now visible in AI. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have positioned AI as a matter of economic strength and national security, sending a clear message that speed matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has taken a state-led approach, directing capital toward local AI firms to reduce reliance on US technology. In Europe, efforts have focused more on regulation, though fears of overregulation have led to new programs — such as the AI Continent Action Plan and a €1 billion Apply AI fund — to boost adoption and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, venture capital and sovereign wealth funds are investing heavily, even before widespread AI demand exists. These early bets assume that adoption will eventually justify the buildout. But if that demand slows, some investors could be left with stranded assets, much like the unused fibre networks that followed the dot-com bubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For businesses, the challenge is different. Instead of financing the next infrastructure wave, they face the question of how to use AI to strengthen their operations. The companies that survived the dot-com downturn — such as Amazon — succeeded by aligning technology with real business value rather than market hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-market-warnings-over-a-possible-ai-bubble"&gt;Market warnings over a possible AI bubble&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England recently warned that markets could suffer a sharp correction if confidence in AI falters, calling the potential impact on the UK’s financial system “material.” The warning reflects growing caution among policymakers about how quickly AI-related valuations have climbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concern is shared by some investors and economists who believe the rapid pace of AI spending may outstrip short-term returns. Others, however, argue that building AI infrastructure now is essential groundwork for future innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-long-term-ai-infrastructure-amid-bubble-fears"&gt;Building long-term AI infrastructure amid bubble fears&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether companies are worried about AI infrastructure costs and energy demand, Simon Miceli, Managing Director of Cloud and AI Infrastructure for APJC at Cisco, said he views the issue from the opposite angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than fearing overcapacity, he said what’s happening now is a large-scale buildout to support the industrialisation of AI. The question, he said, isn’t whether AI demand exists today, but whether the world is preparing fast enough for what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miceli acknowledged that some correction in the AI market is likely, but he believes the long-term need for AI computing power justifies current investment levels. “There’s a race to develop AI and build the capability behind it,” he said, adding that demand will eventually meet supply as applications mature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-different-shades-of-caution"&gt;Different shades of caution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the industry, opinions vary on whether AI’s momentum represents hype or healthy growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, at the Milken Institute Asia Summit 2025, Singapore’s GIC Chief Investment Officer Bryan Yeo said valuations in early-stage AI ventures appear inflated, with many startups commanding “huge multiples” despite modest revenues. He suggested that while some firms may justify their valuations, others are unlikely to deliver returns that match investor expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, said that during periods of excitement like this, investors often struggle to separate good ideas from bad ones — though he also noted that innovation-driven bubbles often leave behind real progress once the market settles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs, economist Joseph Briggs argued that the current surge in AI infrastructure spending remains economically sustainable. He said the long-term case for AI investment is strong, but the ultimate winners are still uncertain given how quickly technology changes and how easily companies can switch providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, ABB CEO Morten Wierod told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that while he doesn’t see an AI bubble, supply chain and construction limits could slow the rollout of new data centres. IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas added that even if there’s a downturn, it’s unlikely to cause a systemic financial crisis since AI investments aren’t debt-driven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also acknowledged market overexcitement, predicting that some investors will lose large sums while others will profit heavily — an outcome that mirrors past technology bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite growing talk of an AI bubble, many investors remain committed to the sector. UBS equity strategists said that about 90% of investors who think the market is overheated are still holding AI-related assets, suggesting most believe the industry has not yet peaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-cycle-not-a-collapse"&gt;A cycle, not a collapse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While concerns about an AI bubble are valid, most experts agree that the technology’s long-term impact is undeniable. As Cisco’s Ben Dawson put it, every major technological transition goes through a cycle of hype, correction, and consolidation — but what remains afterward reshapes industries for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the question isn’t whether AI will endure, but how well businesses and investors can navigate the growing pains that come with every market bubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Growtika)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: NVIDIA GPUs to power Oracle’s next-gen enterprise AI services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-109914" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

He said technological shifts of this scale often follow a familiar pattern — early excitement, heavy investment, and eventual market correction before long-term value takes hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawson noted that while some AI projects or business models may not last, the overall transformation is real and lasting. He added that, much like the internet revolution, AI will permanently reshape business and society, and organisations that ignore it do so at their own risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-role-of-governments-and-global-policy"&gt;The role of governments and global policy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public policy is also shaping how the AI cycle unfolds — and how governments might cushion the risks of a potential AI bubble. As &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt; pointed out, in the US, government involvement has helped define past technology eras — often through incentives and early investments that encourage private innovation. The same pattern is now visible in AI. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have positioned AI as a matter of economic strength and national security, sending a clear message that speed matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has taken a state-led approach, directing capital toward local AI firms to reduce reliance on US technology. In Europe, efforts have focused more on regulation, though fears of overregulation have led to new programs — such as the AI Continent Action Plan and a €1 billion Apply AI fund — to boost adoption and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, venture capital and sovereign wealth funds are investing heavily, even before widespread AI demand exists. These early bets assume that adoption will eventually justify the buildout. But if that demand slows, some investors could be left with stranded assets, much like the unused fibre networks that followed the dot-com bubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For businesses, the challenge is different. Instead of financing the next infrastructure wave, they face the question of how to use AI to strengthen their operations. The companies that survived the dot-com downturn — such as Amazon — succeeded by aligning technology with real business value rather than market hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-market-warnings-over-a-possible-ai-bubble"&gt;Market warnings over a possible AI bubble&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England recently warned that markets could suffer a sharp correction if confidence in AI falters, calling the potential impact on the UK’s financial system “material.” The warning reflects growing caution among policymakers about how quickly AI-related valuations have climbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concern is shared by some investors and economists who believe the rapid pace of AI spending may outstrip short-term returns. Others, however, argue that building AI infrastructure now is essential groundwork for future innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-long-term-ai-infrastructure-amid-bubble-fears"&gt;Building long-term AI infrastructure amid bubble fears&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether companies are worried about AI infrastructure costs and energy demand, Simon Miceli, Managing Director of Cloud and AI Infrastructure for APJC at Cisco, said he views the issue from the opposite angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than fearing overcapacity, he said what’s happening now is a large-scale buildout to support the industrialisation of AI. The question, he said, isn’t whether AI demand exists today, but whether the world is preparing fast enough for what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miceli acknowledged that some correction in the AI market is likely, but he believes the long-term need for AI computing power justifies current investment levels. “There’s a race to develop AI and build the capability behind it,” he said, adding that demand will eventually meet supply as applications mature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-different-shades-of-caution"&gt;Different shades of caution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the industry, opinions vary on whether AI’s momentum represents hype or healthy growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, at the Milken Institute Asia Summit 2025, Singapore’s GIC Chief Investment Officer Bryan Yeo said valuations in early-stage AI ventures appear inflated, with many startups commanding “huge multiples” despite modest revenues. He suggested that while some firms may justify their valuations, others are unlikely to deliver returns that match investor expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, said that during periods of excitement like this, investors often struggle to separate good ideas from bad ones — though he also noted that innovation-driven bubbles often leave behind real progress once the market settles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs, economist Joseph Briggs argued that the current surge in AI infrastructure spending remains economically sustainable. He said the long-term case for AI investment is strong, but the ultimate winners are still uncertain given how quickly technology changes and how easily companies can switch providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, ABB CEO Morten Wierod told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that while he doesn’t see an AI bubble, supply chain and construction limits could slow the rollout of new data centres. IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas added that even if there’s a downturn, it’s unlikely to cause a systemic financial crisis since AI investments aren’t debt-driven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also acknowledged market overexcitement, predicting that some investors will lose large sums while others will profit heavily — an outcome that mirrors past technology bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite growing talk of an AI bubble, many investors remain committed to the sector. UBS equity strategists said that about 90% of investors who think the market is overheated are still holding AI-related assets, suggesting most believe the industry has not yet peaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-cycle-not-a-collapse"&gt;A cycle, not a collapse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While concerns about an AI bubble are valid, most experts agree that the technology’s long-term impact is undeniable. As Cisco’s Ben Dawson put it, every major technological transition goes through a cycle of hype, correction, and consolidation — but what remains afterward reshapes industries for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the question isn’t whether AI will endure, but how well businesses and investors can navigate the growing pains that come with every market bubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Growtika)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: NVIDIA GPUs to power Oracle’s next-gen enterprise AI services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-109914" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The textbooks provide more personalised support for students struggling with lessons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Korean government originally commissioned publishers to produce the AI textbooks, who in turn spent around $567m to develop the online, digital texts. The use of AI textbooks was made mandatory in the country from the beginning of the school year in March, but has since been classed as ‘optional’ after just one semester. The number of schools using the AI textbooks has halved in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking in the National Assembly in January this year, legislator Kang Kyung-sook asked the Minister for Education, “Traditional print textbooks take 18 months to develop, nine months for review, and six months for preparation. But the AI textbooks took only 12 [months to develop], three [months for review], and three months [for preparation] […]. Why was it rushed? Since they target children, they require careful verification and careful procedures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The failure of the AI textbook scheme has also been blamed on the politicisation of the issue, and a change of government as the programme was being rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology programmes in schools since the widespread adoption of the internet are relatively common, have cost taxpayers considerably less, and lasted much longer – despite eventual failure or wholesale realignment. In South Africa’s Guateng Province in the early 2000s, the Online Schools Project was designed to equip schools with computer labs and internet connections, but was scrapped in 2013 at a cost of R1-billion rand ($57m), according to some reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Malaysia’s 1BestariNet – a cloud-based VLE (virtual learning environment) – was terminated after eight years amid investigations into alleged inconsistencies between internet speed claims and the reality experienced by many schools. The overall cost of that project was put in the billions of ringgit (one billion ringgit is around $235m).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the speed of the failure of the South Korean AI textbooks project and its high cost, suggest the educational adoption of AI texts delivered digitally is pitted with difficulty. An academic study conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published earlier this year hinted that using AI in educational contexts lowers brain activity in the long-term, which suggests the technology may not be suitable for developing minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Adorable sleeping students in the undergraduate library” by benchilada is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take our quiz: How much do you know about antimicrobial resistance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This week we had some terrifying news from the World Health Organization: Antibiotics are failing us.
