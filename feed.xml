As supporters cheered in waves of blue and white, capturing moments on their phones and sharing videos (despite the crushing crowd density), China Mobile Shanghai’s newly deployed 5G-A network monetisation strategy was being tested in real-time, powered by Huawei’s GainLeap solution and intelligent wireless infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the media section, the scale of the technical challenge became apparent – ensuring 80,000 simultaneous users could stream, upload, and transact without network degradation. This was something that required more than additional bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China Mobile Shanghai has become the first carrier in China to launch a differentiated 5G-A experience package, marking what industry observers see as a shift in how telecom operators might address revenue growth in saturated markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “5G-A Exclusive Package for Shenhua Football Fans” is a way to transform the elastic capabilities of 5G-Advanced networks into tangible value that users can perceive and are willing to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical foundation for this 5G-A network monetisation strategy relies heavily on Huawei’s technology portfolio, from the GainLeap solution that identifies premium subscribers, to the AI-powered intelligent wireless boards that optimise network performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The business model innovation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership between China Mobile Shanghai and Shanghai Shenhua Football Club offers approximately 200,000 football fans an annual package that combines network performance guarantees with fan-specific benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribers receive network acceleration on 5G-A, access to all matches via the Migu streaming service, unlimited video ringback tone downloads, and Shanghai Shenhua Football Club merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach to 5G-A network monetisation addresses what China Mobile Shanghai identifies as an important pain point for the telecommunications industry: how to drive quality growth when user acquisition has reached its ceiling. Rather than competing solely on price or basic connectivity, the package creates value through enhanced experiences in specific use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The technical infrastructure behind the experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Shanghai Stadium, China Mobile Shanghai implemented an elastic, scalable network capable of handling massive concurrent demand. During the match, with 80,000 users accessing the network simultaneously, 5G-A package subscribers can achieve download speeds of up to 600 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The necessary technical foundation relies on Huawei’s GainLeap solution, which lets the network identify 5G-A subscribers and allocates them a high-speed 3CC (three-component carrier) channel. The differentiation is key to the 5G-A network monetisation model – creating measurable performance differences between standard and premium subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, Huawei’s AI-powered intelligent wireless boards play a central role. They integrate on-board communications capabilities with artificial intelligence to perceive network service types, user experience goals, device characteristics, and resource status, in milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to test data provided by China Mobile Shanghai, they have helped result in QR code scanning latency reduced by 47%, WeChat uploading time shortened by 25%, live streaming speeds increased by 27%, and high-definition video ratios increased by 11%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure deployment scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the high concurrent demand during events, China Mobile Shanghai and Huawei conducted comprehensive network upgrades at the stadium. The lower stands received 32 new 2.6 GHz and 4.9 GHz pRRUs (passive remote radio units), more than doubling overall network capacity. Seven escalator entrances each received a 4.9 GHz EM device to eliminate coverage dead spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On match days, more than 40 engineers are stationed onsite for real-time network monitoring and dynamic optimisation. Outside of the stadium, China Mobile Shanghai has achieved continuous 5G-A coverage in the area inside Shanghai’s Outer Ring Road, the five new towns further out, and 21 metro lines in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The practical user experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fans at the match, the differentiated service manifested practically. The high bandwidth and business-level assurance capabilities enabled quick mobile payments for drinks, snacks, and souvenirs onsite. Users could share video highlights in real time without lag, even during peak moments when thousands of fans uploaded data simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to instantly see likes and comments from friends while still in the stadium represents the kind of enhanced experience that China Mobile Shanghai is betting users will value enough to pay a premium for. Whether this bet pays off commercially remains to be seen, but the technical execution at the September 21 match demonstrated that the infrastructure delivers on its promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industry implications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative raises questions about the future of 5G-A network monetisation strategies in the telecommunications industry. Traditional models have struggled to justify the massive infrastructure investments required for 5G and latterly, 5G-Advanced networks. By creating tiered experiences tied to specific user communities – in this case, football fans – carriers may have found a way to differentiate services beyond simple speed tiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach also represents a test case for how deeply integrated AI capabilities in network infrastructure can enable new business models. The intelligent wireless boards’ ability to make millisecond-level decisions about resource allocation is what makes the performance differentiation technically feasible at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China Mobile Shanghai’s target of serving 200,000 Shenhua fans provides a measurable benchmark for assessing commercial viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As telecommunications companies globally grapple with how to monetise increasingly expensive network upgrades, China Mobile Shanghai’s experiment with community-specific, experience-based packages may offer insights for the industry’s evolution beyond traditional connectivity provision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: Smart Shanghai &lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company touted that with this framework, developers gain access to AI models without worrying about any inference cost. Plus, these local models have capabilities such as guided generation and tool calling built in.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As iOS 26 is rolling out to all users, developers have been updating their apps to include features powered by Apple’s local AI models. Apple’s models are small compared with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Meta. That is why local-only features largely improve quality of life with these apps rather than introducing major changes to the app’s workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below are some of the first apps to tap into Apple’s AI framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lil-artist"&gt;Lil Artist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Lil Artist app offers various interactive experiences to help kids learn different skills like creativity, math, and music. Developer Arima Jain and Aman Jain shipped an AI story creator with the iOS 26 update. This allows users to select a character and a theme, with the app generating a story using AI. The developer said that the text generation in the story is powered by the local model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047762" height="451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/screenshot_3x_postspark_2025-09-01_01-19-08.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lil Artist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daylish"&gt;Daylish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The developer of the Daylish app is working on a prototype for automatically suggesting emojis for timeline events based on the title for the daily planner app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moneycoach"&gt;MoneyCoach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finance tracking app MoneyCoach has two neat features powered by local models. First, the app shows insights about your spending, such as whether you spent more than average on groceries for that particular week. The other feature automatically suggests categories and subcategories for a spending item for quick entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of financial tracking app MoneyCoach where the screen shows summary of accounts and shows a weekly insight on grocery spend for the week. " class="wp-image-3047763" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01-Foundation-Models-Insights.jpeg?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;MoneyCoach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lookup"&gt;LookUp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The word learning app LookUp has added two new modes using Apple’s AI models. There is a new learning mode, which leverages a local model to create examples corresponding to a word. Plus, the example asks users to explain the usage of the word in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of LookUp word learning app that shows a screen that displays an example to understand a new word " class="wp-image-3047764" height="400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Learn-Modes-2.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;LookUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The developer is also using on-device models to generate a map view of a word’s origin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Lookup app with a map view showing origin of a word." class="wp-image-3047765" height="400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Etymology-Maps-2.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lookup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tasks"&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just like a few other apps, the Tasks app implemented a feature to suggest tags for an entry using local models automatically. It’s also using these models to detect a recurring task and schedule it accordingly. And the app lets users speak a few things and use the local model to break them down into various tasks without using the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="This is a lifestyle shot of Tasks app showing screen with a new feautre that uses local models to suggest tags when you enter a task." class="wp-image-3047766" height="407" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tasks-app.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-day-one"&gt;Day One&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Automattic-owned journaling app Day One is using Apple’s models to get highlights and suggest titles for your entry. The team has also implemented a feature to generate prompts that nudge you to dive deeper and write more based on what you have already written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot showing Day One journaling app's features implemented using Apple's local model. These features include a summary, title suggestion, and prompt generation to go deeper into writing. " class="wp-image-3047759" height="625" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/On-Device-AI-scaled-1.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Day One&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crouton"&gt;Crouton&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recipe app Crouton is using Apple Intelligence to suggest tags for a recipe and assign names to timers. It also uses AI to break down a block of text into easy-to-follow steps for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signeasy"&gt;Signeasy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Digital signing app Signeasy is using Apple’s local models to extract key insights from a contract and give users a summary of the document they are signing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dark-noise"&gt;Dark Noise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Background sound app Dark Noise has used Apple’s local models to let users describe a soundscape in a few words and generate one based on that. You can adjust the levels of different elements of the soundscape once it is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lights-out"&gt;Lights Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lights Out is the new app to track the F1 season and grand prix from Shihab Mehboob, developer of Twitter client Avery and Mastodon client Mammoth. The app uses on-device AI models to summarize commentary during a race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-capture"&gt;Capture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Note-taking app Capture is using local AI to show category suggestions to users as they type in their notes or tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050861" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Capture.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lumy"&gt;Lumy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sun and weather-tracking app Lumy now shows neat weather-related suggestions on the app using AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050860" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lumy_image_iPhone_109_cef6.png?w=340" width="340" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lumy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cardpointers"&gt;CardPointers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CardPointers is an app that helps you track your credit card expenses and gives suggestions on the best way to earn points from the cards you have. The app’s new version is using AI to let users ask questions about their cards and offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050862" height="463" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CardPointers-for-Credit-Cards_image_iPhone_105_eb71.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;CardPointers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-guitar-wiz"&gt;Guitar Wiz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Guitar Wiz is a guitar learning app using the Apple Foundation Model framework in a few ways. Users will see an explanation of a chord while learning it. The app is showing advanced players’ insights based on time intervals. Plus, the AI model is helping the developer support over 15 languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SmartGym app uses local AI to convert the description of a workout to a step-wise set with rep counts, intervals, and equipment. It also gives users workout summaries with monthly progress, routine breakdowns, and individual exercise performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stoic"&gt;Stoic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Journaling app Stoic is using Apple’s models to give personalized prompts to users based on their mood logging. The models can also help users summarize posts, search past entries, and organize them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3053975" height="918" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Stoic-apple-models.jpg?w=484" width="653" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Stoic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-swingvision"&gt;SwingVision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This app helps players of racquet sports such as tennis and pickleball improve their form based on the video recordings. The app makers are now using Foundational models to give actionable and specific feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zoho"&gt;Zoho&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India-based productivity suite company Zoho is using local models to power summarization, translation, and transcription across its apps like Notebook for documents and Tables for spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trainfitness"&gt;TrainFitness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The workout app is using on-device models to suggest an alternative for an exercise when you don’t have particular equipment available to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stuff"&gt;Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The to-do app has a listen mode that uses Apple’s AI models to listen to the user and convert the voice to individual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will continue updating this list as we discover more apps using Apple’s local models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Earlier this year, Apple introduced its Foundation Models framework during WWDC 2025, which allows developers to use the company’s local AI models to power features in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company touted that with this framework, developers gain access to AI models without worrying about any inference cost. Plus, these local models have capabilities such as guided generation and tool calling built in.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As iOS 26 is rolling out to all users, developers have been updating their apps to include features powered by Apple’s local AI models. Apple’s models are small compared with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Meta. That is why local-only features largely improve quality of life with these apps rather than introducing major changes to the app’s workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below are some of the first apps to tap into Apple’s AI framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lil-artist"&gt;Lil Artist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Lil Artist app offers various interactive experiences to help kids learn different skills like creativity, math, and music. Developer Arima Jain and Aman Jain shipped an AI story creator with the iOS 26 update. This allows users to select a character and a theme, with the app generating a story using AI. The developer said that the text generation in the story is powered by the local model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047762" height="451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/screenshot_3x_postspark_2025-09-01_01-19-08.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lil Artist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daylish"&gt;Daylish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The developer of the Daylish app is working on a prototype for automatically suggesting emojis for timeline events based on the title for the daily planner app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moneycoach"&gt;MoneyCoach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finance tracking app MoneyCoach has two neat features powered by local models. First, the app shows insights about your spending, such as whether you spent more than average on groceries for that particular week. The other feature automatically suggests categories and subcategories for a spending item for quick entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of financial tracking app MoneyCoach where the screen shows summary of accounts and shows a weekly insight on grocery spend for the week. " class="wp-image-3047763" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01-Foundation-Models-Insights.jpeg?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;MoneyCoach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lookup"&gt;LookUp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The word learning app LookUp has added two new modes using Apple’s AI models. There is a new learning mode, which leverages a local model to create examples corresponding to a word. Plus, the example asks users to explain the usage of the word in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of LookUp word learning app that shows a screen that displays an example to understand a new word " class="wp-image-3047764" height="400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Learn-Modes-2.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;LookUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The developer is also using on-device models to generate a map view of a word’s origin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Lookup app with a map view showing origin of a word." class="wp-image-3047765" height="400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Etymology-Maps-2.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lookup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tasks"&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just like a few other apps, the Tasks app implemented a feature to suggest tags for an entry using local models automatically. It’s also using these models to detect a recurring task and schedule it accordingly. And the app lets users speak a few things and use the local model to break them down into various tasks without using the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="This is a lifestyle shot of Tasks app showing screen with a new feautre that uses local models to suggest tags when you enter a task." class="wp-image-3047766" height="407" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tasks-app.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-day-one"&gt;Day One&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Automattic-owned journaling app Day One is using Apple’s models to get highlights and suggest titles for your entry. The team has also implemented a feature to generate prompts that nudge you to dive deeper and write more based on what you have already written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot showing Day One journaling app's features implemented using Apple's local model. These features include a summary, title suggestion, and prompt generation to go deeper into writing. " class="wp-image-3047759" height="625" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/On-Device-AI-scaled-1.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Day One&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crouton"&gt;Crouton&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recipe app Crouton is using Apple Intelligence to suggest tags for a recipe and assign names to timers. It also uses AI to break down a block of text into easy-to-follow steps for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signeasy"&gt;Signeasy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Digital signing app Signeasy is using Apple’s local models to extract key insights from a contract and give users a summary of the document they are signing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dark-noise"&gt;Dark Noise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Background sound app Dark Noise has used Apple’s local models to let users describe a soundscape in a few words and generate one based on that. You can adjust the levels of different elements of the soundscape once it is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lights-out"&gt;Lights Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lights Out is the new app to track the F1 season and grand prix from Shihab Mehboob, developer of Twitter client Avery and Mastodon client Mammoth. The app uses on-device AI models to summarize commentary during a race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-capture"&gt;Capture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Note-taking app Capture is using local AI to show category suggestions to users as they type in their notes or tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050861" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Capture.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lumy"&gt;Lumy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sun and weather-tracking app Lumy now shows neat weather-related suggestions on the app using AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050860" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lumy_image_iPhone_109_cef6.png?w=340" width="340" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lumy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cardpointers"&gt;CardPointers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CardPointers is an app that helps you track your credit card expenses and gives suggestions on the best way to earn points from the cards you have. The app’s new version is using AI to let users ask questions about their cards and offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050862" height="463" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CardPointers-for-Credit-Cards_image_iPhone_105_eb71.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;CardPointers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-guitar-wiz"&gt;Guitar Wiz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Guitar Wiz is a guitar learning app using the Apple Foundation Model framework in a few ways. Users will see an explanation of a chord while learning it. The app is showing advanced players’ insights based on time intervals. Plus, the AI model is helping the developer support over 15 languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SmartGym app uses local AI to convert the description of a workout to a step-wise set with rep counts, intervals, and equipment. It also gives users workout summaries with monthly progress, routine breakdowns, and individual exercise performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stoic"&gt;Stoic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Journaling app Stoic is using Apple’s models to give personalized prompts to users based on their mood logging. The models can also help users summarize posts, search past entries, and organize them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3053975" height="918" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Stoic-apple-models.jpg?w=484" width="653" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Stoic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-swingvision"&gt;SwingVision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This app helps players of racquet sports such as tennis and pickleball improve their form based on the video recordings. The app makers are now using Foundational models to give actionable and specific feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zoho"&gt;Zoho&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India-based productivity suite company Zoho is using local models to power summarization, translation, and transcription across its apps like Notebook for documents and Tables for spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trainfitness"&gt;TrainFitness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The workout app is using on-device models to suggest an alternative for an exercise when you don’t have particular equipment available to you.&lt;/p&gt;

While it might not feel immediately disruptive, for startups waiting on permits, visas, or regulatory approvals, even a few weeks can become an existential problem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On this episode of Equity, Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and Max Zeff talk through how uncertainty is affecting startups in ways people might not realize, plus the messy reality of AI companies still trying to figure out sustainable business models.&lt;/p&gt;

On its first day, Sora saw 56,000 downloads, and is now ranked as the No. 3 Top Overall app on Apple’s U.S. App Store, according to new data from app intelligence provider Appfigures. On Friday, October 3, it became the No. 1 app on the U.S. App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That puts it ahead of Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm estimates Sora’s iOS app pulled in a total of 164,000 installs during its first two days, September 30 and October 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The day-one figure also puts Sora’s debut ahead of the performance of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and puts it on par with xAI’s Grok launch. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we’ll admit. It’s possible the new video app could have attracted even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; installs if it were open to all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite this restriction, it’s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers’ hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the chagrin of some at OpenAI, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity. But who’s to say that humanity isn’t benefiting from deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asking, “Are my piggies enjoying their slop?”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To compare Sora’s early success to other AI apps, Appfigures had to run an analysis that only looked at the other AI apps’ U.S. and Canadian downloads. That’s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and limited itself to U.S. users at the time, while Grok limited its iOS-only release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn’t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought its Claude app to iOS last year. &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app’s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively. Sora tied with Grok for day-one installs, at 56,000. And it easily beat out the launches from AI apps Claude and Copilot. The former pulled in 21,000 day-one downloads, while the latter only saw 7,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sora also hit the U.S. App Store’s top charts, becoming the No. 3 overall top app by day two. For comparison, ChatGPT reached No. 1 on its second day, while Grok was No. 4, Gemini was No. 6, Copilot was No. 19, and Claude was No. 78. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;As generative AI has taken off since ChatGPT's debut, inspiring hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and infrastructure developments, the top question on many people's minds has been: Is generative AI a bubble, and if so, when will it pop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help us potentially answer that question, I'll be hosting a live conversation with prominent AI critic Ed Zitron on October 7 at 3:30 pm ET as part of the Ars Live series. As Ars Technica's senior AI reporter, I've been tracking both the explosive growth of this industry and the mounting skepticism about its sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch the discussion live on YouTube when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zitron is the host of the &lt;em&gt;Better Offline&lt;/em&gt; podcast and CEO of EZPR, a media relations company. He writes the newsletter Where's Your Ed At, where he frequently dissects OpenAI's finances and questions the actual utility of current AI products. His recent posts have examined whether companies are losing money on AI investments, the economics of GPU rentals, OpenAI's trillion-dollar funding needs, and what he calls "The Subprime AI Crisis."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our conversation, we'll dig into whether the current AI investment frenzy matches the actual business value being created, what happens when companies realize their AI spending isn't generating returns, and whether we're seeing signs of a peak in the current AI hype cycle. We'll also discuss what it's like to be a prominent and sometimes controversial AI critic amid the drumbeat of AI mania in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ed and I don't see eye to eye on everything, his sharp criticism of the AI industry's excesses should make for an engaging discussion about one of tech's most consequential questions right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us for what should be a lively conversation about the sustainability of the current AI boom.&lt;/p&gt;

As Ars Technica's senior AI reporter, I've been tracking both the explosive growth of this industry and the mounting skepticism about its sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch the discussion live on YouTube when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zitron is the host of the &lt;em&gt;Better Offline&lt;/em&gt; podcast and CEO of EZPR, a media relations company. He writes the newsletter Where's Your Ed At, where he frequently dissects OpenAI's finances and questions the actual utility of current AI products. His recent posts have examined whether companies are losing money on AI investments, the economics of GPU rentals, OpenAI's trillion-dollar funding needs, and what he calls "The Subprime AI Crisis."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our conversation, we'll dig into whether the current AI investment frenzy matches the actual business value being created, what happens when companies realize their AI spending isn't generating returns, and whether we're seeing signs of a peak in the current AI hype cycle. We'll also discuss what it's like to be a prominent and sometimes controversial AI critic amid the drumbeat of AI mania in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ed and I don't see eye to eye on everything, his sharp criticism of the AI industry's excesses should make for an engaging discussion about one of tech's most consequential questions right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us for what should be a lively conversation about the sustainability of the current AI boom.&lt;/p&gt;

On Friday Supabase announced that it raised a fresh $100 million Series E on a $5 billion valuation, led by Accel and Peak XV. This is just four months after closing its $200 million Series D on a $2 billion valuation, led by Accel, with Coatue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And that Series D was just seven months after raising an $80 million Series C led by Sequoia spinoff Peak XV and David Sacks’ Craft Ventures at an undisclosed valuation. PitchBook estimated Supabase was valued at around $765 million in that deal, post-money.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So that’s $380 million raised in a year and an over 500% valuation step up, assuming PitchBook’s estimates of the Series C valuation are in the ballpark. Supabase has now raised a total of $500 million, it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open source database service Supabase was founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson (pictured), a few years before the LLM-powered vibe coding craze spawned. It was originally a Y Combinator startup that offered developers a Postgres-based open source alternative to Google’s Firebase. Firebase is a database that was also designed to power AI apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Supabase combines Postgres with other enterprise-grade open source tools for features like authentication, auto-generated APIs, file storage, and a vector toolkit (necessary for many AI apps).&amp;nbsp;It eased the difficult parts of setting up a database down to a few button clicks. Consequently it became a popular back end for vibe-coding tools — which write apps with natural language prompts —&amp;nbsp;like fast-growing Lovable and Bolt. It is increasingly used as the database of choice for Figma and other uber popular AI coding tools like Replit, Cursor, and Claude Code, it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Interestingly, because Supabase is open source and supported by a community of developers — claiming 4 million developers as users — it is allowing community members to also buy stock as part of this Series E funding, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
