&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Felicis, a returning investor, is considering doubling down on the company for the Series C, according to two sources. Felicis declined to comment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is currently targeting a valuation of $10 billion or more, one person said. That’s up from an $8 billion target valuation that the company discussed a couple of months ago, one person said. However, terms of the final deal could still change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has told potential investors that it already has multiple offers. VCs have been reaching out to Mercor preemptively with offers valuing the company at as much as $10 billion, the Information previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch also understands that the company has brought on at least two new investors to raise funds for the potential deal through special purpose vehicles (SPVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s previous round was announced in February – a $100 million Series B at a $2 billion valuation led by Felicis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2022, Mercor is approaching $450 million in annualized run-rate revenue, one person said. The company told TechCrunch in February that its annual revenue (calculated by multiplying the latest month by 12) had reached $75 million at that time. In March, Mercor CEO Brendan Foody posted on X that ARR was $100 million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has told investors it is on track to hit the $500 million ARR milestone faster than Anysphere,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the startup that makes AI coding assistant Cursor, according to one source familiar with the situation. Anysphere famously hit $500 million in ARR about a year after its product launched. Unlike Anysphere, which is still burning cash, Mercor generated $6 million in profit in the first half of the year, Forbes reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor earns revenue by providing companies with specialized domain experts to&amp;nbsp; perform AI model training — such as scientists, doctors, and lawyers — and charging an hourly finder’s fee and matching rate for their work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company claims to supply data labeling contractors to five top AI labs, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI, as well as to Tesla and Nvidia. According to sources, an outsized portion of its revenue is coming from a subset of those brands, including OpenAI.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To further diversify its business model, Mercor has been telling investors that it is adding more software infrastructure for reinforcement learning –&amp;nbsp; a training method where a model or agent’s decisions are verified or disputed, enabling it to incorporate feedback and improve over time. The company also intends to eventually build an AI-powered recruiting marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, Mercor faces competition from companies like Surge AI, which is reportedly in talks to raise funding at a $25 billion valuation, as well as from Turing Labs and other data labeling firms like Scale AI that are also expanding into RL services. Some believe that OpenAI’s recently launched hiring platform could lead the AI giant to create its own human-expert-powered RL training service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When reached for comment, Foody told TechCrunch, “We haven’t been trying to raise at all,” and, “We turn down offers every month.” He also said the company’s ARR is higher than $450 million. However, he clarified that the company’s revenue includes the total amount that customers pay Mercor for services before its contractors receive their portion. He added this is a common accounting practice recommended by audit firms and used by competitors Surge AI and Scale AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup was co-founded in 2023 by Thiel Fellows and Harvard dropouts Brendan Foody (CEO), Adarsh Hiremath (CTO), and Surya Midha (COO). All three co-founders are still in their early twenties. To take the company to the next level, Mercor recently appointed Sundeep Jain, a former chief product officer at Uber with decades of experience, as its first president, Forbes reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor was recently sued by competitor Scale AI for misappropriation of trade secrets. Scale AI alleges that one of its former employees who later joined Mercor “stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information,” according to a copy of the lawsuit TechCrunch previously reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That is the mission behind AegisAI, a new email security startup that has just emerged from stealth with $13 million in seed funding co-led by Accel and Foundation Capital.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 90% of successful cyberattacks begin with a phishing email, per U.S. federal cybersecurity agency CISA. A recent CrowdStrike study (PDF) also found that phishing messages generated by large language models (LLMs) had a 54% click-through rate in 2024, far higher than the 12% rate for human-written emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AegisAI aims to counter this growing threat with its suite of autonomous AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded by former Google Safe Browsing and reCAPTCHA executives Cy Khormaee and Ryan Luo, the startup offers an orchestrated network of real-time AI agents that inspect, analyze, and neutralize email threats autonomously, without relying on any specific set of rules. This approach challenges typical email security platforms that rely on static rules and often require extensive user training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The sum of all evil is a PDF attachment in an email. That’s always where all the attacks started, and so I really wanted to solve this problem,” Khormaee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="a photo of AegisAI co-founders Ryan Luo (Left) and Cy Khormaee (Right)" class="wp-image-3044483" height="1280" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aegisai-co-founders_d8bd27.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;AegisAI co-founders Ryan Luo (Left) and Cy Khormaee (Right)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Khormaee was head of product and director of product management at Google for over five years until July 2023. During that time, he led the security team responsible for protecting Google, its four billion users, and four million websites from phishing, malware, and fraud, using products like Safe Browsing, reCAPTCHA, and Web Risk. It was also during this time that he first met Luo, who had spent almost a decade at Google and was part of the Safe Browsing team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google gave Khormaee firsthand experience in building phishing detection technologies, a deep understanding of security from the company’s perspective, and how to develop and scale security businesses quickly, he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before Google, Khormaee founded the sales intelligence platform Contastic, which was acquired by SugarCRM in 2016. He later served as VP of product management at Attentive for over a year and a half until November 2024, before starting AegisAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AegisAI has built reasoning agents, each of which is a custom-built LLM tuned to a specific threat. Once the orchestrating agent recognizes a threat or potential threat, it calls other agents in the network, which Khormaee refers to as “buddies.” These agents then run the analysis, reason with each other, and respond to the orchestrating agent with a verdict.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The agents perform real-time analysis of every message component, including links, attachments, metadata, QR codes, and behavioral patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="a screenshot showing the AegisAI dashboard, showing the number of users and malicious emails blocked." class="wp-image-3044486" height="1250" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aegisai_executive_overview_dashboard.jpg" width="1596" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;AegisAI dashboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;AegisAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What we know from building these tools at Google is what all the things are about an email you need to analyze? What are all the data sources? What are all the techniques for spotting invasion, and all the nasty stuff adversaries do that we’ve seen over 10 years of playing chess with these adversaries?” said Khormaee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While AegisAI has currently built over 10 agents for this work, Khormaee told TechCrunch that there could be 50 to 100 agents over time as adversaries become smarter and try to fool the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I fully believe that in two years, adversaries will understand what we’re doing. They’ll retool and attack what we’re doing, and then we’ll need to build more agents to stay ahead of them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike a typical email security platform that uses a rules-based approach, these AI agents spot a bunch of attacks and self-tune themselves for every possible variant of those attacks in real-time, said Khormaee. The startup has developed multiple AI models tailored to various threats and specific industries, including those in venture capital and financial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside quickly detecting threats, AegisAI’s agents help reduce false positives by up to 90% compared to traditional solutions, the startup claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It takes “no more than five minutes” for customers to install AegisAI’s system on a Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 email account via an API, per Khormaee. Once set up, the startup will send a report in a couple of days with the details on what the system found in the environment, including false positives and false negatives. It will then run in read-only mode for a week and then activate quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s so hard without this technology to solve this very heterogeneous problem in email,” said Khormaee.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup, with offices in San Francisco and New York, is currently running a pilot with customers in the U.S. and Europe and has already added three paying customers, including data privacy compliance software Lokker and crypto payment platform Mesh Connect. The startup currently has a team of six members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the fresh investment, Khormaee said the startup plans to expand its technical expertise and build a robust go-to-market infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As AI is increasingly helping hackers to launch mass-scale email attacks, former Google security leaders have joined forces to build autonomous AI agents that aim to stop phishing, malware, and business email compromise threats before they ever reach user inboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

Their startup, TwinMind, has raised $5.7 million in seed funding and released an Android version, along with a new AI speech model. It also has an iPhone version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Co-founded in March 2024 by Daniel George (CEO) and his former Google X colleagues Sunny Tang and Mahi Karim (both CTOs), TwinMind runs in the background, capturing ambient speech (with user permission) to build a personal knowledge graph. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By turning spoken thoughts, meetings, lectures and conversations into structured memory, the app can generate AI-powered notes, to-dos, and answers. It works offline, processes audio in real-time to transcribe on-device, and can capture audio continuously for 16–17 hours without draining the device’s battery, the founders say. The app can also back up user data so conversations can be recovered if the device is lost, though users can opt-out of that. It also supports real-time translation in over 100 languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TwinMind differentiates itself from AI meeting note-takers like Otter, Granola, and Fireflies by capturing audio passively in the background all day. To make this possible, the team built a low-level service in pure Swift that runs natively on the iPhone. In contrast, many competitors use React Native and rely on cloud-based processing, which Apple restricts from running in the background for extended periods, George said in an exclusive interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We spent about six to seven months last year just perfecting this audio capture continuously and getting there to find a lot of hacks around Apple’s walled garden,” he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;George left Google X in 2020 and got the idea for TwinMind in 2023 when was working at JPMorgan as Vice President and Applied AI Lead, attending back-to-back meetings each day. To save time, he built a script that captured audio, transcribed it on his iPad, and fed it into ChatGPT — which began to understand his projects and even generate usable code. Impressed by the results, he shared it with friends and posted about it on Blind, where others showed interest but did not want something running on their work laptops. That led him to build an app that could run on a personal phone, quietly listening during meetings to gather useful context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to the mobile app, TwinMind offers a Chrome extension that gathers additional context through browser activity. Using vision AI, it can visually scan open tabs and interpret content from various platforms, including email, Slack, and Notion.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup even used the extension itself to shortlist interns from over 850 applications they received this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We opened all the LinkedIn profiles and CVs of the 854 applicants in browser tabs, then asked the Chrome extension to rank the best candidates,” George said. “It did a fantastic job — that’s how we hired our final four interns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3044501" height="990" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/twinmind-chrome-extension.jpg" width="1488" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;TwinMind offers a Chrome Extension for additional context gathering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TwinMind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He noted that current AI chatbots — including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude — cannot easily process hundreds of documents or parse sign-ups from tools like LinkedIn or Gmail to gather contextual information. Similarly, AI-powered browsers such as those from Perplexity and The Browser Company lack the ability to build knowledge from your offline conversations and in-person meetings.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup currently has over 30,000 users, with about 15,000 of them active each month. As much as 20–30% of TwinMind users also use the Chrome extension, George said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the U.S. is the largest base for TwinMind so far, the startup is also seeing traction from India, Brazil, the Philippines, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TwinMind targets the general audience, although 50–60% of its users are currently professionals, about 25% are students, and the remaining 20–25% are individuals using it for personal purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;George told TechCrunch that his father is among the individuals using TwinMind to write their autobiography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of AI’s significant drawbacks is its potential to compromise user privacy. But George asserted that TwinMind does not train its models on user data and is designed to work without sending recordings to the cloud. Unlike many other AI note-taking apps, TwinMind does not let users access audio recordings later — the audio is deleted on the fly — while only the transcribed text is stored locally in the app, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-google-x-experience-helped-speed-things-up"&gt;Google X experience helped speed things up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The TwinMind co-founders spent a few years working on various projects at Google X. George told TechCrunch that he worked on six projects alone, including iyO — the team behind AI-powered earbuds, which recently made headlines for suing OpenAI and Jony Ive. That experience helped the TwinMind team move quickly from concept to product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Google X was actually the perfect place to prepare for starting your own company,” said George. “There are around 30 to 40 startup-like projects happening at any given time. Nobody else gets to work at six early-stage startups over two or three years before launching their own — at least not in such a short span.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3044536" height="1280" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/twinmind-co-founders.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;TwinMind Co-founders Sunny Tang, Daniel George, and Mahi Karim (From Left to Right)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TwinMind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before joining Google, George worked on applying deep learning to gravitational wave astrophysics as part of the Nobel Prize–winning LIGO group at the University of Illinois’ National Center for Supercomputing Applications. He had completed his PhD in AI for astrophysics in just one year — at the age of 24 — a feat that led him to join Stephen Wolfram’s research lab in 2017 as a deep learning and AI researcher.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That early connection with Wolfram came full circle years later — he ended up writing the first check for TwinMind, marking his first-ever investment in a startup. The recent seed round was led by Streamlined Ventures, with participation from Sequoia Capital and other investors, including Wolfram. The round values TwinMind at $60 million post-money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-twinmind-ear-3-model"&gt;TwinMind Ear-3 model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to its apps and browser extension, TwinMind has also introduced the TwinMind Ear-3 model, a successor to its existing Ear-2, which supports over 140 languages worldwide and has a word error rate of 5.26%, the startup said. The new model can also recognize different speakers in a conversation and has a speaker diarization error rate of 3.8%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new AI model is a fine-tuned blend of several open-source models, trained on a curated set of human-annotated internet data — including podcasts, videos, and movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We found that the more languages you support, the better the model gets at understanding accents and regional dialects because it’s training on a broader range of speakers,” George said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The model costs $0.23/ hour and will be available through an API to developers and enterprises over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3044497" height="1137" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/twinmind-ear-3-pricing-performance.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TwinMind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Ear-3, unlike the Ear-2, does not support a complete offline experience, as it is larger in size and runs on the cloud. However, the app automatically switches to Ear-2 if the internet goes away and then moves back to Ear-3 when it is back, George said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the introduction of the Ear-3, TwinMind now offers a Pro subscription at $15/month, with a larger context window of up to 2 million tokens and email support within 24 hours. Nonetheless, the free version still exists with all the existing features including unlimited hours of transcriptions and on-device speech recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup currently has a team of 11 members. It plans to hire a few designers to enhance its user experience and set up a business development team to sell its API. Furthermore, there are plans to spend some money on acquiring new users.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Three former Google X scientists aim to give you a second brain virtually — not in the sci-fi or chip-in-your-head sense — but through an AI-powered app that gains context by listening to everything you say in the background. Their startup, TwinMind, has raised $5.7 million in seed funding and released an Android version, along with a new AI speech model. It also has an iPhone version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TwinMind differentiates itself from AI meeting note-takers like Otter, Granola, and Fireflies by capturing audio passively in the background all day. To make this possible, the team built a low-level service in pure Swift that runs natively on the iPhone. In contrast, many competitors use React Native and rely on cloud-based processing, which Apple restricts from running in the background for extended periods, George said in an exclusive interview.&lt;/p&gt;

Our reporters and editors traced where AI’s carbon footprint stands now, and where it’s headed, as AI barrels towards billions of daily users.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’ve just produced a short video to accompany that investigation.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI is changing the grid. Could it help more than it harms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The rising popularity of AI is driving an increase in electricity demand so significant it has the potential to reshape the grid. Energy consumption by data centers has gone up by 80% from 2020 to 2025 and is likely to keep growing. Electricity prices are already rising, especially in places where data centers are most concentrated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet many people, especially in Big Tech, argue that AI will be, on balance, a positive force for the grid. They claim that the technology could help get more clean power online faster, run our power system more efficiently, and predict and prevent failures that cause blackouts. How much merit is there to that argument?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Casey Crownhart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three big things we still don’t know about AI’s energy burden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—James O’Donnell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, when my colleague Casey Crownhart and I spent six months researching the climate and energy burden of AI, we came to see one number in particular as our white whale: how much energy the leading AI models, like ChatGPT or Gemini, use up when generating a single response.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We pestered Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft, but each company refused to provide its figure for our article. But then this summer, after we published, a strange thing started to happen. They finally started to release the numbers we’d been calling for.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;So with this newfound transparency, is our job complete? Did we finally harpoon our white whale? I reached out to some of our old sources, and some new ones, to find out.

That’s a problem: It could lead us to deploy an AI system in a highly sensitive field like medicine without understanding its critical flaws.But a team at Google DeepMind that studies something called mechanistic interpretability has been working on new ways to let us peer under the hood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

Our reporters and editors traced where AI’s carbon footprint stands now, and where it’s headed, as AI barrels towards billions of daily users.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’ve just produced a short video to accompany that investigation.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI is changing the grid. Could it help more than it harms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The rising popularity of AI is driving an increase in electricity demand so significant it has the potential to reshape the grid. Energy consumption by data centers has gone up by 80% from 2020 to 2025 and is likely to keep growing. Electricity prices are already rising, especially in places where data centers are most concentrated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet many people, especially in Big Tech, argue that AI will be, on balance, a positive force for the grid. They claim that the technology could help get more clean power online faster, run our power system more efficiently, and predict and prevent failures that cause blackouts. How much merit is there to that argument?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Casey Crownhart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three big things we still don’t know about AI’s energy burden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—James O’Donnell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, when my colleague Casey Crownhart and I spent six months researching the climate and energy burden of AI, we came to see one number in particular as our white whale: how much energy the leading AI models, like ChatGPT or Gemini, use up when generating a single response.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We pestered Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft, but each company refused to provide its figure for our article. But then this summer, after we published, a strange thing started to happen. They finally started to release the numbers we’d been calling for.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;So with this newfound transparency, is our job complete? Did we finally harpoon our white whale? I reached out to some of our old sources, and some new ones, to find out.

That’s a problem: It could lead us to deploy an AI system in a highly sensitive field like medicine without understanding its critical flaws.But a team at Google DeepMind that studies something called mechanistic interpretability has been working on new ways to let us peer under the hood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.
