But beneath the headline-grabbing sell-out and subsequent controversy lies a more significant story: the enterprise implications of operating-system-level AI agents that can autonomously execute complex, multi-step tasks in device ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ZTE Nubia M153, powered by ByteDance’s Doubao large language model, represents both a consumer gadget experiment and a preview of how agentic AI smartphones could reshape workplace productivity, field operations, and enterprise mobility strategies – if the technology can overcome fundamental trust and governance challenges that enterprise adoption demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From consumer curiosity to enterprise necessity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer appeal is obvious: voice-activated restaurant bookings, automatic photo editing, cross-platform price comparisons. But, according to Gartner projections, by 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI capabilities, up from less than 1% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smartphone, as the most ubiquitous computing device in enterprise workflows, becomes a important testing ground. “Agentic AI in industries like manufacturing, construction, healthcare, and energy will enhance decisions, boost safety, and streamline tasks,” says Nicholas Muy, CISO of Scrut Automation. However, he cautions that early adopters must navigate real risks around AI errors and security gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKinsey’s research indicates 23% of organisations are scaling agentic AI systems in at least one business function, with an additional 39% experimenting with AI agents. However, enterprise adoption differs from consumer use: it needs governance frameworks, audit trails, role-based permissions, and compliance mechanisms that ByteDance’s consumer-focused prototype notably lacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;China’s strategic advantage in software-hardware integration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ByteDance’s approach – partnering with ZTE rather than building proprietary hardware – mirrors successful enterprise AI strategies. The company positions Doubao as a system-level integration that any manufacturer can adopt, similar to how Google used Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 157 million monthly active users as of August 2025, according to data from QuestMobile, Doubao already dominates China’s consumer AI market, more than doubling Tencent’s Yuanbao with73 million users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software-over-hardware strategy addresses what Morgan Stanley analysts identifies as a important weakness: major smartphone manufacturers, including Apple, Huawei, and Xiaomi, possess strong enough technology capabilities to self-develop AI assistants rather than partnering with third-party providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ByteDance’s realistic target market appears to be second-tier manufacturers and, potentially, enterprise device management platforms seeking differentiated capabilities. For enterprise buyers, this fragmentation presents both opportunity and challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisations can select device manufacturers based on hardware requirements while standardising on AI capabilities – but only if governance and security frameworks prove robust enough for regulated industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The privacy panic that revealed enterprise requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The swift backlash following entrepreneur Taylor Ogan’s viral demos on social media of the M153’s capabilities, which illuminated what enterprise adoption demands. When users witnessed an AI agent with deep system privileges autonomously accessing apps, processing payments, and manipulating data, the immediate concern wasn’t convenience – it was control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a Forum Ventures survey of 100 senior enterprise IT decision-makers, trust remains the primary adoption barrier. “The trust gap is enormous,” says Jonah Midanik, General Partner at Forum Ventures. “While AI agents can perform tasks with remarkable efficiency, their outputs are based on statistical probabilities rather than inherent truths.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ByteDance’s reported rollback of capabilities demonstrates an understanding that enterprise-grade agentic AI smartphones require granular permission systems, comprehensive logging, and the ability to define strict operational boundaries – features notably absent from the consumer prototype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enterprise vs. consumer: Different use cases, different requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise uses for agentic AI smartphones diverge sharply from consumer applications. Field service technicians could use AI agents that proactively surface equipment histories, recommend optimal routes based on real-time conditions, and guide complex procedures without manual searches. Healthcare providers could access patient context and decision support without navigating multiple systems. Financial services professionals could receive compliance-checked recommendations and automated workflow orchestration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to PwC research, 79% of organisations have implemented AI agents at some level, with 96% of IT leaders planning expansions in 2025. However, Cloudera’s survey of 1,484 IT decision-makers revealed that successful enterprise deployment requires industry-specific data integration, transparent decision-making processes, and phased rollouts with comprehensive testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer smartphone market, projected by IDC to ship 912 million generative AI-enabled units by 2028, emphasises personalisation and convenience. Enterprise deployments prioritise auditability, compliance, and risk mitigation – requirements that consumer-focused agentic AI smartphones haven’t yet addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Global competitive dynamics and regional strategies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US-China technology divide adds complexity. Apple’s delayed Apple Intelligence rollout in mainland China created an opening that ByteDance, Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent are competing to fill. However, Apple’s approach differs fundamentally: tight hardware-software integration with on-device processing prioritises user privacy – a stance that resonates with enterprise security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ByteDance’s licensing strategy positions Doubao for rapid market penetration in Chinese manufacturers, potentially establishing de facto standards before Western competitors can match operating-system-level integration. For multinational enterprises operating in regions, this creates device management challenges around data sovereignty, compliance frameworks, and consistent user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Counterpoint Research, Asia-Pacific represents the fastest-growing market for AI agents, with the US currently holding 40.1% revenue share. Enterprise buyers must navigate a bifurcated landscape, potentially maintaining separate device strategies for different regulatory environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The path forward: Solutions over hype&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders evaluating agentic AI smartphones, ByteDance’s prototype offers valuable lessons in what to demand from vendors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, comprehensive governance frameworks that define decision boundaries, log all autonomous actions, and provide role-based access controls. Anthropic’s enterprise solution, which features centralised provisioning, audit logs, and role-based granting of permissions, may demonstrate those requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, hybrid approaches that balance on-device processing for sensitive operations with cloud capabilities for complex reasoning. Enterprise deployments require flexibility to meet varying data residency and compliance requirements in jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, phased rollouts starting with low-risk use cases. Amazon’s deployment of AI agents for Java application modernisation illustrates how enterprises can capture value while managing risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ByteDance-ZTE collaboration ultimately previews an inevitable convergence: agentic AI capabilities will become standard smartphone features, not premium differentiators. Enterprise adoption will follow proven patterns – pilot programmes in controlled environments, security validation, and gradual expansion as governance frameworks mature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question facing enterprise technology leaders isn’t whether agentic AI smartphones will affect workplace productivity, but whether they’ll shape deployment strategies proactively or react to consumer technologies retrofitted with enterprise features. The privacy panic that followed ByteDance’s launch suggests that organisations demanding enterprise-grade security and governance from the outset will define the technology’s trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gartner projects that at least 15% of work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, compared with none in 2024, the smartphone becomes a communication device and an autonomous enterprise agent. The winners won’t be those who deploy fastest, but those who deploy most thoughtfully – with security and scalable governance built in from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: IBM cites agentic AI, data policies, and quantum as 2026 trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111182" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This group exercise is mostly fun and always engrossing, but at times it can also be quite difficult.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We collectively pitch dozens of ideas, and the editors meticulously review and debate the merits of each. We agonize over which ones might make the broadest impact, whether one is too similar to something we’ve featured in the past, and how confident we are that a recent advance will actually translate into long-term success. There is plenty of lively discussion along the way.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 2026 list will come out on January 12—so stay tuned. In the meantime, I wanted to share some of the technologies from this year’s reject pile, as a window into our decision-making process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These four technologies &lt;em&gt;won’t &lt;/em&gt;be on our 2026 list of breakthroughs, but all were closely considered, and we think they’re worth knowing about.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Male contraceptives&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are several new treatments in the pipeline for men who are sexually active and wish to prevent pregnancy—potentially providing them with an alternative to condoms or vasectomies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two of those treatments are now being tested in clinical trials by a company called Contraline. One is a gel that men would rub on their shoulder or upper arm once a day to suppress sperm production, and the other is a device designed to block sperm during ejaculation. (Kevin Eisenfrats, Contraline’s CEO, was recently named to our Innovators Under 35 list). A once-a-day pill is also in early-stage trials with the firm YourChoice Therapeutics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Though it’s exciting to see this progress, it will still take several years for any of these treatments to make their way through clinical trials—assuming all goes well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World models&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;World models have become the hot new thing in AI in recent months. Though they’re difficult to define, these models are generally trained on videos or spatial data and aim to produce 3D virtual worlds from simple prompts. They reflect fundamental principles, like gravity, that govern our actual world. The results could be used in game design or to make robots more capable by helping them understand their physical surroundings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite some disagreements on exactly what constitutes a world model, the idea is certainly gaining momentum. Renowned AI researchers including Yann LeCun and Fei-Fei Li have launched companies to develop them, and Li’s startup World Labs released its first version last month. And Google made a huge splash with the release of its Genie 3 world model earlier this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though these models are shaping up to be an exciting new frontier for AI in the year ahead, it seemed premature to deem them a breakthrough. But definitely watch this space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of personhood&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thanks to AI, it’s getting harder to know who and what is real online. It’s now possible to make hyperrealistic digital avatars of yourself or someone you know based on very little training data, using equipment many people have at home. And AI agents are being set loose across the internet to take action on people’s behalf.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of this is creating more interest in what are known as personhood credentials, which could offer a way to verify that you are, in fact, a real human when you do something important online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, we’ve reported on efforts by OpenAI, Microsoft, Harvard, and MIT to create a digital token that would serve this purpose. To get it, you’d first go to a government office or other organization and show identification. Then it’d be installed on your device and whenever you wanted to, say, log into your bank account, cryptographic protocols would verify that the token was authentic—confirming that you are the person you claim to be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not this particular approach catches on, many of us in the newsroom agree that the future internet will need something along these lines. Right now, though, many competing identity verification projects are in various stages of development. One is World ID by Sam Altman’s startup Tools for Humanity, which uses a twist on biometrics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;If these efforts reach critical mass—or if one emerges as the clear winner, perhaps by becoming a universal standard or being integrated into a major platform—we’ll know it’s time to revisit the idea.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The world’s oldest baby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In July, senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou broke the news of a record-setting baby. The infant developed from an embryo that had been sitting in storage for more than 30 years, earning him the bizarre honorific of “oldest baby.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This odd new record was made possible in part by advances in IVF, including safer methods of thawing frozen embryos. But perhaps the greater enabler has been the rise of “embryo adoption” agencies that pair donors with hopeful parents. People who work with these agencies are sometimes more willing to make use of decades-old embryos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This practice could help find a home for some of the millions of leftover embryos that remain frozen in storage banks today. But since this recent achievement was brought about by changing norms as much as by any sudden technological improvements, this record didn’t quite meet our definition of a breakthrough—though it’s impressive nonetheless.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/benched.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re a longtime reader, you probably know that our newsroom selects 10 breakthroughs every year that we think will define the future.

The results could be used in game design or to make robots more capable by helping them understand their physical surroundings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite some disagreements on exactly what constitutes a world model, the idea is certainly gaining momentum. Renowned AI researchers including Yann LeCun and Fei-Fei Li have launched companies to develop them, and Li’s startup World Labs released its first version last month. And Google made a huge splash with the release of its Genie 3 world model earlier this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though these models are shaping up to be an exciting new frontier for AI in the year ahead, it seemed premature to deem them a breakthrough. But definitely watch this space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of personhood&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thanks to AI, it’s getting harder to know who and what is real online. It’s now possible to make hyperrealistic digital avatars of yourself or someone you know based on very little training data, using equipment many people have at home. And AI agents are being set loose across the internet to take action on people’s behalf.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of this is creating more interest in what are known as personhood credentials, which could offer a way to verify that you are, in fact, a real human when you do something important online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, we’ve reported on efforts by OpenAI, Microsoft, Harvard, and MIT to create a digital token that would serve this purpose. To get it, you’d first go to a government office or other organization and show identification. Then it’d be installed on your device and whenever you wanted to, say, log into your bank account, cryptographic protocols would verify that the token was authentic—confirming that you are the person you claim to be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not this particular approach catches on, many of us in the newsroom agree that the future internet will need something along these lines. Right now, though, many competing identity verification projects are in various stages of development. One is World ID by Sam Altman’s startup Tools for Humanity, which uses a twist on biometrics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;If these efforts reach critical mass—or if one emerges as the clear winner, perhaps by becoming a universal standard or being integrated into a major platform—we’ll know it’s time to revisit the idea.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The world’s oldest baby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In July, senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou broke the news of a record-setting baby. The infant developed from an embryo that had been sitting in storage for more than 30 years, earning him the bizarre honorific of “oldest baby.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This odd new record was made possible in part by advances in IVF, including safer methods of thawing frozen embryos. But perhaps the greater enabler has been the rise of “embryo adoption” agencies that pair donors with hopeful parents. People who work with these agencies are sometimes more willing to make use of decades-old embryos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This practice could help find a home for some of the millions of leftover embryos that remain frozen in storage banks today. But since this recent achievement was brought about by changing norms as much as by any sudden technological improvements, this record didn’t quite meet our definition of a breakthrough—though it’s impressive nonetheless.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/08/1128969/2026-breakthroughs-list-leftovers/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] OpenAI boasts enterprise win days after internal ‘code red’ on Google threat (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/openai-boasts-enterprise-win-days-after-internal-code-red-on-google-threat/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI released new data Monday showing enterprise usage of its AI tools has surged dramatically over the past year, with ChatGPT message volume growing 8x since November 2024 and workers reporting they’re saving up to an hour daily. The findings arrive a week after CEO Sam Altman sent an internal “code red” memo about the competitive threat of Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The timing underscores OpenAI’s push to reframe its position as the enterprise AI leader, even as it faces mounting pressures. While close to 36% of U.S. businesses are ChatGPT Enterprise customers compared to 14.3% for Anthropic, per Ramp AI Index, the majority of OpenAI’s revenue still comes from consumer subscriptions — a base that’s being threatened by Google’s Gemini. OpenAI also must compete against rival AI firm Anthropic — whose revenue comes mainly from B2B sales – and, increasingly, open-weight model providers for enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI giant has committed&amp;nbsp; $1.4 trillion to infrastructure commitments over the next few years, making enterprise growth essential to its business model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you think about it from an economic growth perspective, consumers really matter,” Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, said during a briefing. “But when you look at historically transformative technologies like the steam engine, it’s when firms adopt and scale these technologies that you really see the biggest economic benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s new findings suggest that adoption among larger enterprises is not only growing but becoming more integrated into workflows. Employees aren’t only sending more messages — organizations using OpenAI’s API (its developer interface) are consuming 320 times more “reasoning tokens” than they were a year ago, suggesting companies are using AI for more complex problem-solving. That, or they are experimenting heavily with the new tech and burning through tokens, without necessarily getting long-term value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That increase in reasoning tokens, which correlates with increased energy usage, could be expensive for companies and therefore not sustainable in the long term. TechCrunch has asked OpenAI about enterprise budget allocation for AI and the sustainability of this growth rate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3073657" height="269" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond raw usage metrics, OpenAI is also seeing changes in how companies deploy its tools. Use of custom GPTs — which companies use to codify institutional knowledge into assistants or automate workflows —&amp;nbsp; jumped 19x this year, now accounting for 20% of enterprise messages, the report found. OpenAI pointed to digital bank customer BBVA, which it says regularly uses over 4,000 custom GPTs.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It shows you how much people are really able to take this powerful technology and start to customize it to the things that are useful to them,” said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, during the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These integrations have led to meaningful time savings, according to OpenAI. Participants reported saving 40 to 60 minutes per day with OpenAI’s enterprise products — though that may not include time spent learning the systems, prompting, or correcting AI output.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The report found that enterprise workers are also increasingly leveraging AI tools to expand their own capabilities. Three quarters of those surveyed say AI enables them to do things, including technical tasks, they couldn’t do before. OpenAI reported a 36% increase in coding-related messages outside of engineering, IT, and research teams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While OpenAI drove home the idea that its technology is democratizing access to skills, it’s important to note that more vibe coding could lead to more security vulnerabilities and other flaws. When asked about this, Lightcap pointed to OpenAI’s recent release of its agentic security researcher Aardvark, which is in private beta, as a potential way to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3073656" height="340" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;The gaps are widest between frontier and median workers for writing, coding, and analysis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s report also found that even the most active ChatGPT Enterprise users aren’t using the most advanced tools available to them, like data analysis, reasoning, or search. During the briefing, Lightcap mused that this was because fully adopting AI systems requires a mindset shift and deeper integration with enterprise data and processes. Adoption of advanced features will take time, he said, as companies retool workflows to better understand what’s possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lightcap and Chatterji also stressed a report finding that showed a “growing divide in AI adoption,” with some “frontier” workers using more tools more often to save more time than the “laggards.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There are firms that still very much see these systems as a piece of software, something I can buy and give to my teams and that’s kind of the end of it,” Lightcap said. “And then there are companies that are really starting to embrace it, almost more like an operating system. It’s basically a re-platforming of a lot of the company’s operations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s leadership — which certainly feels the pressure of the firm’s $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments — framed this as an opportunity for laggards to catch up. For workers training AI systems to replicate their work, “catching up” might feel more like a countdown.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI released new data Monday showing enterprise usage of its AI tools has surged dramatically over the past year, with ChatGPT message volume growing 8x since November 2024 and workers reporting they’re saving up to an hour daily.

In the UK, many GP (general practice) surgeries’ phone lines are tied up in the mornings as patients try to contact their medical practitioner for appointments. More acute need can be delayed among calls with routine enquiries, meaning high-priority callers can be left waiting for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system uses voice-based AI to handle calls, schedule appointments, and assess patient needs, and is capable of handling many calls simultaneously, channelling callers with appointment requests, those seeking general advice, prescription requests, and seeking results of clinical tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded by Daniel Park, InTouchNow.ai draws on his 30+ years of experience in medical call centres. The AI receptionist answers calls quickly, and can automatically update integrated appointment systems. Practices can record a voice messages to personalise the experience for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits for practices include reducing the numbers of missed calls, decreased workload for reception staff, and improved access by patients to medical services. Being entirely software-based, the system operates outside regular hours, which can reduce the need for staff overtime at times of peak demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system integrates with common GP software like Surgery Connect, AWS, and Anima, automating tasks and maintaining patient data security while giving practices full control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology supports over 200 languages, with options for different dialects and accents, an aspect that will help patients in multi-cultural areas like inner-cities. Several practices in the UK are already using InTouchNow.ai and have reported positive results in call handling and patient access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The much under-funded National Health Service in the UK has been quick to deploy AI-powered software to reduce its operating costs, often targeting the reduction of staff administration costs to funnel funds into patient care. For example, Smart Triage is an AI-powered system deployed in UK GP practices that can triage patients making initial enquiries, and based on their responses, book them into the right care pathway, such as GP or nurse appointment, or referral to specialist clinician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An evaluation of Smart Triage at a Surrey GP practice in 2024 showed the platform reduced the average patient waiting time by 73%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clinicians, especially GPs, iatroX is a UK-based AI clinical reference platform that helps doctors retrieve evidence-based clinical guidance, and summarising relevant literature &amp;amp; guidelines. Doctors in general practice are expected to be able to assess a full range of patients’ needs, and such platforms help clinicians identify the cause of uncommon symptoms when GPs might lack specialist knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An evaluation in 2025 found a majority of surveyed users stating iatroX was useful (~86%) or reliable (~79%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As documented by NHS England, AI platforms are used in practice, tackling tasks like diagnosis, the monitoring of chronic disease, provision of prescription advice, and handling general administration tasks that otherwise would take up clinicians’ time. Of all the sectors where sensitive data has to be protected, medicine has one of the highest standards of governance, making the deployment of AI a delicate balance between operational effectiveness and the preservation of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Doctor appointment” by Taric25 is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
