&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many organizations are eager to explore how AI can transform their business, its success will hinge not on tools, but on how well people embrace them. This shift requires a different kind of leadership rooted in empathy, curiosity and intentionality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technology leaders must guide their organizations with clarity and care. People use technology to solve human problems, and AI is no different, which means adoption is as emotional as it is technical, and must be inclusive to your organization from the start.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Empathy and trust are not optional. They are essential for scaling change and encouraging innovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-ai-moment-feels-different"&gt;Why this AI moment feels different&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year alone, we’ve seen AI adoption accelerate at breakneck speed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, it was generative AI, then Copilots; now we’re in the era of AI agents. With each new wave of AI innovation, businesses rush to adopt the latest tools, but the most important part of technological change that is often overlooked? People.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past, teams had time to adapt to new technologies. Operating systems or enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools evolved over years, giving users more room to learn these platforms and acquire the skills to use them. Unlike previous tech shifts, this one with AI doesn’t come with a long runway. Change arrives overnight, and expectations follow just as fast. Many employees feel like they’re being asked to keep pace with systems they haven’t had time to learn, let alone trust. A recent example would be ChatGPT reaching 100 million monthly active users just two months after launch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This creates friction — uncertainty, fear and disengagement — especially when teams feel left behind. It’s no surprise that 81% of staff still don’t use AI tools in their daily work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This underlines the emotional and behavioral complexity of adoption. Some people are naturally curious and quick to experiment with new technology while others are skeptical, risk-averse or anxious about job security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To unlock the full value of AI, leaders must meet people where they are and understand that adoption will look different across every team and individual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-4-e-s-of-ai-adoption"&gt;The 4 E’s of AI adoption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful AI adoption requires a carefully thought-out framework, which is where the “four E’s” come in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evangelism – inspiring through trust and vision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before employees adopt AI, they need to understand why it matters to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evangelism isn’t about hype. It’s about helping people care by showing them how AI can make their work more meaningful, not just more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leaders must connect the dots between the organization’s goals and individual motivations. Remember, people prioritize stability and belonging before transformation. The priority is to show how AI supports, not disrupts, their sense of purpose and place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use meaningful metrics like DORA or cycle time improvements to demonstrate value without pressure. When done with transparency, this builds trust and fosters a high-performance culture grounded in clarity, not fear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enablement – empowering people with empathy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful adoption depends as much on emotional readiness as it does on technical training. Many people process disruption in personal and often unpredictable ways. Empathetic leaders recognize this and build enablement strategies that give teams space to learn, experiment and ask questions without judgment. The AI talent gap is real; organizations must actively support people in bridging it with structured training, learning time or internal communities to share progress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When tools don’t feel relevant, people disengage. If they can’t connect today’s skills to tomorrow’s systems, they tune out. That’s why enablement must feel tailored, timely and transferable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enforcement – aligning people around shared goals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enforcement doesn’t mean command and control. It is about creating alignment through clarity, fairness and context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People need to understand not just what is expected of them in an AI-driven environment, but why. Skipping straight to results without removing blockers only creates friction. As Chesterton’s Fence suggests, if you don’t understand why something exists, you shouldn’t rush to remove it. Instead, set realistic expectations, define measurable goals and make progress visible across the organization. Performance data can motivate, but only when it’s shared transparently, framed with context and used to lift people up, not call them out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimentation – creating safe spaces for innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Innovation thrives when people feel safe to try, fail and learn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is&amp;nbsp; especially true with AI, where the pace of change can be overwhelming. When perfection is the bar, creativity suffers. Leaders must model a mindset of progress over perfection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my own teams, we’ve seen that progress, not polish, builds momentum. Small experiments lead to big breakthroughs. A culture of experimentation values curiosity as much as execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Empathy and experimentation go hand in hand. One empowers the other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leading-the-change-human-first"&gt;Leading the change, human first&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adopting AI is not just a technical initiative, it’s a cultural reset, one that challenges leaders to show up with more empathy and not just expertise. Success depends on how well leaders can inspire trust and empathy across their organizations. The 4 E’s of adoption offer more than a framework. They reflect a leadership mindset rooted in inclusion, clarity and care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By embedding empathy into structure and using metrics to illuminate progress rather than pressure outcomes, teams become more adaptable and resilient. When people feel supported and empowered, change becomes not only possible, but scalable. That’s where AI’s true potential begins to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Does that suggest something is amiss with the acquisition, or with plans for Ive to lead design work at OpenAI? Not exactly, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who reports that the “deal is on track and has NOT dissolved or anything of the sort.” Instead, he said a judge has issued a restraining order over the io name, forcing the company to pull all materials that used it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI subsequently confirmed this is the case, updating the old announcement page with the statement, “This page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint from iyO about our use of the name ‘io.’ We don’t agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said this does not affect the deal with io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The iyO in question emerged from the Alphabet X “moonshot factory,” and its first announced product is a set of generative AI-powered earbuds. An earlier report at Bloomberg Law noted that iyO had brought a trademark lawsuit against OpenAI, with the judge suggesting she’s open to the company’s argument that OpenAI’s promotional video might already be creating consumer confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For now, at least, the video remains viewable on X.&lt;/p&gt;

Rubin Observatory (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/23/1119129/first-images-vera-c-rubin-observatory/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first spectacular images taken by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory have been released for the world to peruse: a panoply of iridescent galaxies and shimmering nebulas. “This is the dawn of the Rubin Observatory,” says Meg Schwamb, a planetary scientist and astronomer at Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Much has been written about the observatory’s grand promise: to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos by revealing a once-hidden population of far-flung galaxies, erupting stars, interstellar objects, and elusive planets. And thanks to its unparalleled technical prowess, few doubted its ability to make good on that. But over the past decade, during its lengthy construction period, “everything’s been in the abstract,” says Schwamb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, that promise has become a staggeringly beautiful reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rubin’s view of the universe is unlike any that preceded it—an expansive vision of the night sky replete with detail, including hazy envelopes of matter coursing around galaxies and star-paved bridges arching between them. “These images are truly stunning,” says Pedro Bernardinelli, an astronomer at the University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;During its brief perusal of the night sky, Rubin even managed to spy more than 2,000 never-before-seen asteroids, demonstrating that it should be able to spotlight even the sneakiest denizens, and darkest corners, of our own solar system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119119" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NSF-DOE-Rubin-Virgo-cluster-2-Im3crop2.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A small section of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's view of the Virgo Cluster. Three merging galaxies can be seen on the upper right. The view also includes two striking spiral galaxies (lower right), distant galaxies, and many Milky Way stars.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NSF-DOE VERA C. RUBIN OBSERVATORY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today’s reveal is a mere amuse-bouche compared with what’s to come: Rubin, funded by the US National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, is set for at least 10 years of planned observations. But this moment, and these glorious inaugural images, are worth celebrating for what they represent: the culmination of over a decade of painstaking work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“This is a direct demonstration that Rubin is no longer in the future,” says Bernardinelli. “It’s the present.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The observatory is named after the late Vera Rubin, an astronomer who uncovered strong evidence for dark matter, a mysterious and as-yet-undetected &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that’s binding galaxies together more strongly than the gravity of ordinary, visible matter alone can explain. Trying to make sense of dark matter—and its equally mysterious, universe-stretching cousin, dubbed dark energy—is a monumental task, one that cannot be addressed by just one line of study or scrutiny of one type of cosmic object.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s why Rubin was designed to document anything and everything that shifts or sparkles in the night sky. Sitting atop Chile’s Cerro Pachón mountain range, it boasts a 7,000-pound, 3,200-megapixel digital camera that can take detailed snapshots of a large patch of the night sky; a house-size cradle of mirrors that can drink up extremely distant and faint starlight; and a maze of joints and pistons that allow it to swivel about with incredible speed and precision. A multinational computer network permits its sky surveys to be largely automated, its images speedily processed, any new objects easily detected, and the relevant groups of astronomers quickly alerted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that technical wizardry allows Rubin to take a picture of the entire visible night sky once every few days, filling in the shadowed gaps and unseen activity between galaxies. “The sky [isn’t] static. There are asteroids zipping by, and supernovas exploding,” says Yusra AlSayyad, Rubin’s overseer of image processing. By conducting a continuous survey over the next decade, the facility will create a three-dimensional movie of the universe’s ever-changing chaos that could help address all sorts of astronomic queries. What were the very first galaxies like? How did the Milky Way form? Are there planets hidden in our own solar system’s backyard?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rubin’s first glimpse of the firmament is predictably bursting with galaxies and stars. But the resolution, breadth, and depth of the images have taken astronomers aback. “I’m very impressed with these images. They’re really incredible,” says Christopher Conselice, an extragalactic astronomer at the University of Manchester in England.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One shot, created from 678 individual exposures, showcases the Trifid and Lagoon nebulas—two oceans of luminescent gas and dust where stars are born. Others depict a tiny portion of Rubin’s view of the Virgo Cluster, a zoo of galaxies. Hues of blue are coming from relatively nearby whirlpools of stars, while red tints emanate from remarkably distant and primeval galaxies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The rich detail in these images is already proving to be illuminating. “As galaxies merge and interact, the galaxies are pulling stars away from each other,” says Conselice. This behavior can be seen in plumes of diffuse light erupting from several galaxies, creating halos around them or illuminated bridges between them—records of these ancient galaxies’ pasts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Images like these are also likely to contain several supernovas, the explosive final moments of sizable stars. Not only do supernovas seed the cosmos with all the heavy elements that planets—and life—rely on, but they can also hint at how the universe has expanded over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Anais Möller, an astrophysicist at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia, is a supernova hunter. “I search for exploding stars in very far away galaxies,” she says. Older sky surveys have found plenty, but they can lack context: You can see the explosion, but not what galaxy it’s from. Thanks to Rubin’s resolution—amply demonstrated by the Virgo Cluster set of images—astronomers can now “find where those exploding stars live,” says Möller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119150" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NSF-DOE-Rubin-Virgo-cluster-1-Im3crop11.jpg?w=1251" width="1251" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Another small section of the observatory's view of the Virgo Cluster.

RUBIN OBSERVATORY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;While taking these images of the distant universe, Rubin also discovered 2,104 asteroids flitting about in our own solar system—including seven whose orbits hew close to Earth’s own. This number may sound impressive, but it’s just par for the course for Rubin. In just a few months, it will find over a million new asteroids—doubling the current known tally. And over the course of its decadal survey, Rubin is projected to identify 89,000 near-Earth asteroids, 3.7 million asteroids in the belt between Mars and Jupiter, and 32,000 icy objects beyond Neptune.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finding more than 2,000 previously hidden asteroids in just a few hours of observations, then, “wasn’t even hard” for Rubin, says Mario Jurić, an astronomer at the University of Washington. “The asteroids really popped out.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rubin’s comprehensive inventorying of the solar system has two benefits. The first is scientific: All those lumps of rocks and ice are the remnants of the solar system’s formative days, which means astronomers can use them to understand how everything around us was pieced together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second benefit is security. Somewhere out there, there could be an asteroid on an Earthbound trajectory—one whose impact could devastate an entire city or even several countries. Engineers are working on defensive tech designed to either deflect or obliterate such asteroids, but if astronomers don’t know where they are, those defenses are useless. In quickly finding so many asteroids, Rubin has clearly shown that it will bolster Earth’s planetary defense capabilities like no other ground-based telescope.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Altogether, Rubin’s debut has validated the hopes of countless astronomers: The observatory won’t just be an incremental improvement on what’s come before. “I think it’s a generational leap,” says Möller. It is a ruthlessly efficient, discovery-making behemoth—and a firehose of astronomic delights is about to inundate the scientific community. “It’s very scary,” says Möller. “But very exciting at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It's going to be a very hectic decade. As Schwamb puts it, “The roller-coaster starts now.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first spectacular images taken by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory have been released for the world to peruse: a panoply of iridescent galaxies and shimmering nebulas. “This is the dawn of the Rubin Observatory,” says Meg Schwamb, a planetary scientist and astronomer at Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Much has been written about the observatory’s grand promise: to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos by revealing a once-hidden population of far-flung galaxies, erupting stars, interstellar objects, and elusive planets. And thanks to its unparalleled technical prowess, few doubted its ability to make good on that. But over the past decade, during its lengthy construction period, “everything’s been in the abstract,” says Schwamb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, that promise has become a staggeringly beautiful reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rubin’s view of the universe is unlike any that preceded it—an expansive vision of the night sky replete with detail, including hazy envelopes of matter coursing around galaxies and star-paved bridges arching between them. “These images are truly stunning,” says Pedro Bernardinelli, an astronomer at the University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;During its brief perusal of the night sky, Rubin even managed to spy more than 2,000 never-before-seen asteroids, demonstrating that it should be able to spotlight even the sneakiest denizens, and darkest corners, of our own solar system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119119" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NSF-DOE-Rubin-Virgo-cluster-2-Im3crop2.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A small section of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's view of the Virgo Cluster. Three merging galaxies can be seen on the upper right. The view also includes two striking spiral galaxies (lower right), distant galaxies, and many Milky Way stars.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NSF-DOE VERA C. RUBIN OBSERVATORY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today’s reveal is a mere amuse-bouche compared with what’s to come: Rubin, funded by the US National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, is set for at least 10 years of planned observations. But this moment, and these glorious inaugural images, are worth celebrating for what they represent: the culmination of over a decade of painstaking work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“This is a direct demonstration that Rubin is no longer in the future,” says Bernardinelli. “It’s the present.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The observatory is named after the late Vera Rubin, an astronomer who uncovered strong evidence for dark matter, a mysterious and as-yet-undetected &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that’s binding galaxies together more strongly than the gravity of ordinary, visible matter alone can explain. Trying to make sense of dark matter—and its equally mysterious, universe-stretching cousin, dubbed dark energy—is a monumental task, one that cannot be addressed by just one line of study or scrutiny of one type of cosmic object.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s why Rubin was designed to document anything and everything that shifts or sparkles in the night sky. Sitting atop Chile’s Cerro Pachón mountain range, it boasts a 7,000-pound, 3,200-megapixel digital camera that can take detailed snapshots of a large patch of the night sky; a house-size cradle of mirrors that can drink up extremely distant and faint starlight; and a maze of joints and pistons that allow it to swivel about with incredible speed and precision. A multinational computer network permits its sky surveys to be largely automated, its images speedily processed, any new objects easily detected, and the relevant groups of astronomers quickly alerted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that technical wizardry allows Rubin to take a picture of the entire visible night sky once every few days, filling in the shadowed gaps and unseen activity between galaxies. “The sky [isn’t] static. There are asteroids zipping by, and supernovas exploding,” says Yusra AlSayyad, Rubin’s overseer of image processing. By conducting a continuous survey over the next decade, the facility will create a three-dimensional movie of the universe’s ever-changing chaos that could help address all sorts of astronomic queries. What were the very first galaxies like? How did the Milky Way form? Are there planets hidden in our own solar system’s backyard?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rubin’s first glimpse of the firmament is predictably bursting with galaxies and stars.
