Now, it sees a new opportunity for its technology: robotics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;New York-based Runway is known for its video and photo generation AI world models, or large language models that create a simulated version of the real world. Most recently, the company released Gen-4, its video-generating model, in March and Runway Aleph, its video editing model, in July.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Runway’s world models started to improve —&amp;nbsp;and get more realistic —&amp;nbsp;the company began to receive inbound interest from robotics and self-driving car companies looking to use the tech, Anastasis Germanidis, Runway co-founder and CTO, told TechCrunch in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We think that this ability to simulate the world is broadly useful beyond entertainment, even though entertainment is an ever increasing and big area for us,” Germanidis said. “It makes it much more scalable and cost effective to train [robotic] policies that interact with the real world whether that’s in robotics or in self driving.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Germanidis said working with robotics and self-driving car companies was not something Runway initially envisioned when it launched back in 2018. It wasn’t until robotics and other companies in other industries reached out, that the company realized their models had much broader use cases than they originally thought, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Robotics companies are using Runway’s tech for training simulations, Germanidis said. He added that just training robots and self-driving cars in real-world scenarios is costly for companies, takes a long time, and is hard to scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Runway knows it isn’t going to replace real-world training by any means, Germanidis said companies can get a lot of value running simulations on Runway’s models because they have the ability to get incredibly specific.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike in real-world training, using these models makes it easier to test for specific variables and situations without changing anything else in the scenario, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You can take a step back and then simulate the effect of different actions,” he said. “If the car took this turn over this, or perform this action, what will be the outcome of that? Creating those rollouts from the same context, is a really difficult thing to do in the physical world, to basically keep all the other aspects of the environment the same and only test the effect of the specific action you want to take.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Runway isn’t the only company looking to tackle this. For instance, Nvidia released the latest version of its Cosmos world models, in addition to other robot training infrastructure, earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company doesn’t anticipate releasing a “completely separate line of models” for its robotics and self-driving car customers, Germanidis said. Instead, Runway will fine-tune its existing models to better serve these industries. The company is also building a dedicated a robotics team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Germanidis added that while these industries weren’t in the company’s initial pitches to investors, they are on board with this expansion. Runway has raised more than $500 million from investors like Nvidia, Google and General Atlantic at a $3 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The way we think of the company, is really built on a principle, rather than being on the market,” Germanidis said. “That principle is this idea of simulation, of being able to build a better and better representation of the world. Once you have those really powerful models, then you can use them for a wide variety of different markets, a variety of different industries. [The] industries we expect are there already, and they’re going to change even more as a result of the power of generative models.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2183872064.jpg?resize=1200,793" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Runway has spent the past seven years building visual-generating tools for the creative industry.

Yet only 16% of digital transformations succeed, and that’s only 4–11% in traditional industries. The main barriers? Weak leadership commitment, a rigid culture, and a lack of digital talent. LayerX offers an AI SaaS platform to help enterprises scale back-office automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LayerX, a Japanese AI SaaS startup that enables businesses to cut back-office workload, has raised $100 million in a Series B round led by Technology Cross Ventures (TCV), marking the U.S. fund’s first investment in a Japanese startup.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company declined to disclose its valuation, but said both the valuation and the size of the round are among the largest ever raised by a seven-year-old Japanese startup at the Series B stage. Other investors, including MUFG Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Innovation Partners, JAFCO Group, Keyrock Capital, Coreline Venture, and JP Investment, also joined the Series B round, bringing the total raised to $192.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup’s key offerings include Bakuraku, a platform that automates corporate spending workflows, covering expense management, invoice processing, and corporate card operations — for more than 15,000 companies; Alterna, a retail digital securities investment platform developed in partnership with Mitsui &amp;amp; Co.; and Ai Workforce, a generative AI solution designed to streamline workflows and harness enterprise data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2018 by serial entrepreneur Yoshinori Fukushima, who studied machine learning at the University of Tokyo and previously launched the news app Gunosy, which was later listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, LayerX grew out of one of his digital transformation (DX) and blockchain projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The founder launched LayerX after identifying a significant bottleneck in Japan’s enterprise workflows: paper-based invoice processing. This insight prompted the team to pivot into SaaS with their AI-driven platform, Bakuraku, Fukushima told TechCrunch, adding that the platform’s AI-native user experience quickly gained traction, helping LayerX secure major strategic partnerships, including with MUFG, or&amp;nbsp;Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and paving the way for its latest funding round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite a wave of digitalization, many Japanese companies still rely on paper and Excel for expense reimbursements and invoice processing, the CEO continued. Domestically, the startup competes with Money Forward Cloud Keihi, freee, and Rakuraku Seisan. Globally, its rivals include SAP Concur, Rippling, Brex, Ramp, Spendesk, and Airbase. In the AI Workforce space, it faces competition from Harvey, Fukushima noted.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bakuraku differentiates itself with an AI-driven user experience. The company continuously upgrades automation features like “auto-entry and document splitting”, while also investing in AI agents and AI-enabled business processing outsourcing (BPO). Its team includes “more than 12 former CTOs and a Kaggle Grandmaster.” Bakuraku offers a comprehensive, integrated platform covering “expense management, invoice processing, corporate cards, workflows, e-ledger compliance, attendance, and receivables—all in one solution,” Fukushima added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3041362" height="423" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LayerX-CEO-CTO-1.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;CEO of Layerx (Yoshinori Fukushima) and CTO of layerx (Yuki Matsumoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has closed its Series B funding less than two years after securing its Series A in November 2023. Its signature platform, the Bakuraku Suite, has seen significant growth, the seven-year-old company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We passed 10,000 customers in February 2024 and reached 15,000 by April 2025, with more enterprise clients coming on board,” the CEO said. “Headcount has also grown from about 220 employees in October 2023 to around 430 as of the end of July 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LayerX is on track to reach $68 million, equivalent to ¥10 billion, faster than any SaaS company in Japan’s history, according to the company. “The growth benchmark known as T2D3 was achieved ahead of schedule, and we expect to surpass the previous domestic record, which took eight years from product launch, in under five years,” Fukushima said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ai Workforce counts Mitsui &amp;amp; Co. and MUFG Bank among its clients, while Bakuraku serves customers such as Ippudo, IRIS Ohyama, the Imperial Hotel, and Sekisui Chemical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Looking forward, the company targets approximately $680 million (¥100 billion) in annual recurring revenue by fiscal year 2030, with roughly half expected to come from its AI agent business. It also plans to grow its workforce to around 1,000 employees by 2028.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Aging demographics, labor shortages, the adoption of GenAI, and the 2023 implementation of e-invoicing are driving companies to automate finance, tax, procurement, and HR in Japan. Yet only 16% of digital transformations succeed, and that’s only 4–11% in traditional industries. The main barriers? Weak leadership commitment, a rigid culture, and a lack of digital talent. LayerX offers an AI SaaS platform to help enterprises scale back-office automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LayerX, a Japanese AI SaaS startup that enables businesses to cut back-office workload, has raised $100 million in a Series B round led by Technology Cross Ventures (TCV), marking the U.S. fund’s first investment in a Japanese startup.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company declined to disclose its valuation, but said both the valuation and the size of the round are among the largest ever raised by a seven-year-old Japanese startup at the Series B stage. Other investors, including MUFG Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Innovation Partners, JAFCO Group, Keyrock Capital, Coreline Venture, and JP Investment, also joined the Series B round, bringing the total raised to $192.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup’s key offerings include Bakuraku, a platform that automates corporate spending workflows, covering expense management, invoice processing, and corporate card operations — for more than 15,000 companies; Alterna, a retail digital securities investment platform developed in partnership with Mitsui &amp;amp; Co.; and Ai Workforce, a generative AI solution designed to streamline workflows and harness enterprise data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2018 by serial entrepreneur Yoshinori Fukushima, who studied machine learning at the University of Tokyo and previously launched the news app Gunosy, which was later listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, LayerX grew out of one of his digital transformation (DX) and blockchain projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The founder launched LayerX after identifying a significant bottleneck in Japan’s enterprise workflows: paper-based invoice processing. This insight prompted the team to pivot into SaaS with their AI-driven platform, Bakuraku, Fukushima told TechCrunch, adding that the platform’s AI-native user experience quickly gained traction, helping LayerX secure major strategic partnerships, including with MUFG, or&amp;nbsp;Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and paving the way for its latest funding round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite a wave of digitalization, many Japanese companies still rely on paper and Excel for expense reimbursements and invoice processing, the CEO continued. Domestically, the startup competes with Money Forward Cloud Keihi, freee, and Rakuraku Seisan. Globally, its rivals include SAP Concur, Rippling, Brex, Ramp, Spendesk, and Airbase. In the AI Workforce space, it faces competition from Harvey, Fukushima noted.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bakuraku differentiates itself with an AI-driven user experience. The company continuously upgrades automation features like “auto-entry and document splitting”, while also investing in AI agents and AI-enabled business processing outsourcing (BPO). Its team includes “more than 12 former CTOs and a Kaggle Grandmaster.” Bakuraku offers a comprehensive, integrated platform covering “expense management, invoice processing, corporate cards, workflows, e-ledger compliance, attendance, and receivables—all in one solution,” Fukushima added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has closed its Series B funding less than two years after securing its Series A in November 2023. Its signature platform, the Bakuraku Suite, has seen significant growth, the seven-year-old company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We passed 10,000 customers in February 2024 and reached 15,000 by April 2025, with more enterprise clients coming on board,” the CEO said. “Headcount has also grown from about 220 employees in October 2023 to around 430 as of the end of July 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LayerX is on track to reach $68 million, equivalent to ¥10 billion, faster than any SaaS company in Japan’s history, according to the company. “The growth benchmark known as T2D3 was achieved ahead of schedule, and we expect to surpass the previous domestic record, which took eight years from product launch, in under five years,” Fukushima said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ai Workforce counts Mitsui &amp;amp; Co. and MUFG Bank among its clients, while Bakuraku serves customers such as Ippudo, IRIS Ohyama, the Imperial Hotel, and Sekisui Chemical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Looking forward, the company targets approximately $680 million (¥100 billion) in annual recurring revenue by fiscal year 2030, with roughly half expected to come from its AI agent business.
