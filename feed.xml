Love it or hate it, the technology has become a star in its own right, alongside the latest movie trailers and snack brands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Let’s explore the biggest moments from this year’s Big Game ads, which featured everything from robots and AI glasses to a touch of drama involving tech founders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-svedka"&gt;Svedka &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vodka brand Svedka went with what it touts as the first “primarily” AI-generated national Super Bowl spot. The 30-second ad, titled “Shake Your Bots Off,” features the company’s robot character, Fembot, and her new companion, Brobot, dancing their circuits off at a human party.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Svedka’s parent company, Sazerac, it took roughly four months to reconstruct the Fembot and train the AI to mimic facial expressions and body movements, The Wall Street Journal reported. However, the vodka brand noted that certain aspects were still handled by humans, such as developing the storyline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​The company partnered with AI company Silverside to create the Super Bowl spot, according to ADWEEK. Silverside AI is the same team behind recent AI-generated Coca-Cola commercials that sparked controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​It’s a bold move to debut AI-generated content during the Super Bowl, an event known for star-studded, high-production ads. The heavy reliance on AI is polarizing, fueling debates over whether AI will replace creative jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;Boston, MA&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;June 23, 2026&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Either way, Svedka definitely got people talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic"&gt;Anthropic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic’s ad wasn’t just about selling its Claude chatbot; it was about throwing shade. The commercial took a jab at OpenAI’s plan to introduce ads to ChatGPT, with a tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” Rather than focus solely on Claude’s features, it poked fun at the idea of your helpful AI assistant suddenly turning into a hype man for “Step Boost Maxx” insoles, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It wasn’t a standard product pitch, and it escalated into an online feud. OpenAI’s Sam Altman fired back on social media, calling the ad “clearly dishonest.” So while we didn’t get any more Kendrick vs. Drake rap beef this time around, maybe we did get our own AI, nerdy version of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta spotlighted its Oakley-branded AI glasses, designed for sports, workouts, and adventures, including extreme scenarios such as chasing down a departing plane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ad showcased thrill-seekers, from skydivers to mountain bikers, using the glasses to capture epic moments. Famous faces like IShowSpeed and filmmaker Spike Lee made appearances, demonstrating capabilities like filming a basketball dunk in slow motion, posting hands-free to Instagram, and other advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech giant also featured its wearable AI tech in last year’s Super Bowl ad to spark consumer interest, with stars like Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, and Kris Jenner showing off Ray-Ban Meta glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amazon"&gt;Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon’s ad took a cheeky (and slightly unsettling) approach, starring Chris Hemsworth in a satirical “AI is out to get me” storyline. The commercial exaggerates common fears about AI, with Hemsworth humorously accusing Alexa+ of plotting against him. Scenes included Alexa+ closing the garage door on his head and shutting the pool cover while he swam, each mishap escalating in absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond the dark comedy, the ad introduced the new Alexa+, showcasing its enhanced intelligence and capabilities, ranging from managing smart home devices to planning vacations. Alexa+ had been available in early access for over a year and officially launched to all U.S. users on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ring"&gt;Ring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ring’s commercial spotlighted its “Search Party” feature, which leverages AI and a community network to reunite lost pets with their owners. The ad followed a young girl searching for her dog Milo, illustrating how users can upload a pet’s photo to the app, where AI works to identify matches and taps into nearby cameras and the broader Ring user community to help track down missing furry family members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ring recently announced that anyone can now use Search Party, even without owning a Ring security camera. According to the company, the feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog with its owner every day.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-google"&gt;Google&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s ad showcased the Nano Banana Pro, its newest image-generation model. The commercial followed a mother and son as they used AI to envision and design their new home, uploading photos of bare rooms and turning them into personalized spaces with just a few prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ramp"&gt;Ramp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ramp scored big by getting Brian Baumgartner — the actor who played Kevin in “The Office” — for its Super Bowl commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the spot, Baumgartner uses Ramp’s AI-powered spend management platform to “multiply” himself, effortlessly tackling a mountain of work. The ad highlights how Ramp’s all-in-one solution helps teams focus on the most important tasks through smart automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And, as a playful nod to his TV persona, Baumgartner is seen carrying a pot of chili in the ad, referencing Kevin’s legendary scene where he brings his cherished recipe for his co-workers to try, only to disastrously spill the entire pot on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rippling"&gt;Rippling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rippling, the cloud-based workforce management platform, went all in on its first-ever Super Bowl ad. The company tapped comedian Tim Robinson in a spot about onboarding an alien monster, poking fun at HR headaches and the promise of AI automation.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hims-amp-hers"&gt;Hims &amp;amp; Hers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Health company Hims &amp;amp; Hers used its Super Bowl spot to address disparities in healthcare access. The ad cleverly references the lengths the wealthy go to for health and longevity, even appearing to poke fun at Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin spaceflight in 2021 and Bryan Johnson’s expensive anti-aging routines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In recent years, the company launched an AI-powered “MedMatch” tool to deliver more personalized treatment recommendations, especially for mental health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wix"&gt;Wix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Website builder Wix spotlighted its new AI-powered Wix Harmony platform, promising website creation as easy as chatting with a friend. Unveiled in January, the flagship platform combines AI-driven creation and “vibe coding” with full visual editing and customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wix’s biggest competitor, Squarespace, also has a Super Bowl ad this year. Squarespace’s ad has a more cinematic approach starring Emma Stone and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.&lt;/p&gt;
