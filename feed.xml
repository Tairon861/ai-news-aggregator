&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI companies have been hemorrhaging&amp;nbsp;talent&amp;nbsp;the past few weeks. Half of&amp;nbsp;xAI’s&amp;nbsp;founding team&amp;nbsp;has left the company — some on their own, others through “restructuring” — while OpenAI is facing its own shakeups, from the&amp;nbsp;disbanding of its&amp;nbsp;mission alignment team&amp;nbsp;to the firing of a policy exec who opposed its “adult mode” feature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

If successful, the company believes that in a year’s time, more than 30% of its total customer support tickets will be handled by AI voice and chat in all the languages where it also employs a human customer service agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We think this is going to be massive because not only does this reduce the cost base of Airbnb customer service, but the quality of service is going to be a huge step change,” CEO Brian Chesky said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call this week. This seems to suggest he believes the AI would do a better job than its human counterparts in resolving some issues.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also touted its recent hire of CTO Ahmad Al-Dahle, poached from Meta for his AI expertise, and its plans to create an AI-native experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With his guidance, Chesky said that Airbnb was poised to introduce an app that doesn’t just search for you, but one that “knows you.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” Chesky explained, adding that’s why Airbnb brought Al-Dahle on board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ahmad is one of the world’s leading AI experts. He spent 16 years at Apple, and most recently led the generative AI team at Meta that built the Llama models. He’s an expert at pairing massive technical scale with world-class design, which is exactly how we’re going to transform the Airbnb experience,” Chesky noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other businesses poised for disruption by AI, Airbnb’s leadership is pushing the idea that it has a unique database and product that other AI chatbots can’t replicate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A chatbot doesn’t have our 200 million verified identities or our 500 million proprietary reviews, and it can’t message the hosts, which 90% of our guests do,” Chesky told analysts during the earnings call. Instead, he pitched the idea of layering AI over the Airbnb experience, which he claimed would help to accelerate growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company forecast revenue growth would be in the “low double digits” this year, after pulling in $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, above estimates of $2.72 billion. This quarter, it expects revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion, above Wall Street forecasts of $2.53 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Investors still wanted to know if AI platforms could be a risk in the long-term, assuming they moved into the short-term rentals market. Chesky, however, pushed back at that idea, saying that Airbnb isn’t just the consumer-facing app; it’s also the host app, the customer service, and the protections it offers, like insurance and user verifications.  &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve built this over 18 years. We handle more than $100 billion in payments through the platform,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, AI chatbots serve a function similar to search, in that they deliver top-of-funnel traffic, he noted. That traffic also converts at a higher rate than traffic from Google, Chesky pointed out, suggesting that the shift to AI would benefit Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is already using AI to power its search, with the feature now enabled for a “very small percentage” of Airbnb’s traffic, while it experiments with making its search more conversational. Later, the company plans to integrate sponsored listings within search.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Spotify this week told investors its best developers hadn’t written a single line of code since December, thanks to AI, Airbnb offered a more high-level metric on its own internal AI adoption. The company said that 80% of its engineers now use AI tools, and it’s working to get that to 100% soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Airbnb-Summer-feat.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Airbnb says its custom-built AI agent is now handling roughly a third of its customer support issues in North America, and it’s preparing to roll out the feature globally.

          &lt;p&gt;This spring, a Southern California beach town will become the first city in the country where municipal parking enforcement vehicles will use an AI system looking for potential bike lane violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in April, the City of Santa Monica will bring Hayden AI’s scanning technology to seven cars in its parking enforcement fleet, expanding beyond similar cameras already mounted on city buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The more we can reduce the amount of illegal parking, the safer we can make it for bike riders,” Charley Territo, chief growth officer at Hayden AI, told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayden AI’s bus cameras, designed to detect bike lane and bus zone violations, currently exist in two other California cities: Oakland and Sacramento. The company also has installations around the country, including New York City, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia. In September 2025, the company announced that it had installed 2,000 systems on buses worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year, over a 59-day period, Hayden AI also said its technology detected over 1,100 parking violations at the University of California, San Diego—and 88 percent of those were instances of blocking a bike lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayden AI says it sells its product to municipalities and related entities to not only increase bus speed (by removing obstructions) but also improve safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do that by [reducing] one of the biggest causes of collisions with buses—moving out of their lanes,” Territo added. “So the fewer times they have to make a turn, the fewer instances there are [of a crash].”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
            
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;As part of its setup process, the San Francisco-based startup says that it begins any installation by first mapping a city. Then it teaches the AI the local parking enforcement rules. Typically, those rules say that cars can’t block a bike or bus lane. Traditionally, Hayden AI’s cameras have only been mounted on buses, so enforcement was limited to existing routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We tell our system that if you see a vehicle that encroaches on a bike lane, capture a 10-second video and the license plate of that vehicle,” Territo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From there, an evidence package goes to the [police] and they will review and verify the elements—that a prosecutable violation exists—and then they will issue a violation under [state law]. If there is no violation, the system doesn’t capture any data. The system is only looking for scenarios where a bike lane is blocked and a license plate is evident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local bike advocates have applauded this expansion of automated enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Enforcement cannot be everywhere at once. If we can extend their arm so these things can get done, and keep our community safe, that is a win,” Cynthia Rose, the director of Santa Monica Spoke, told Ars. While warning of the potential misuse of bulk data collection in general, Rose was on board with Hayden AI’s particular plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anywhere where there’s bike infrastructure, where I know of, [blocking the lane] is a problem,” Rose said. “It’s tantamount to parking in handicapped zones. It’s just a flat no.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;This spring, a Southern California beach town will become the first city in the country where municipal parking enforcement vehicles will use an AI system looking for potential bike lane violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in April, the City of Santa Monica will bring Hayden AI’s scanning technology to seven cars in its parking enforcement fleet, expanding beyond similar cameras already mounted on city buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The more we can reduce the amount of illegal parking, the safer we can make it for bike riders,” Charley Territo, chief growth officer at Hayden AI, told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayden AI’s bus cameras, designed to detect bike lane and bus zone violations, currently exist in two other California cities: Oakland and Sacramento. The company also has installations around the country, including New York City, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia. In September 2025, the company announced that it had installed 2,000 systems on buses worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year, over a 59-day period, Hayden AI also said its technology detected over 1,100 parking violations at the University of California, San Diego—and 88 percent of those were instances of blocking a bike lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayden AI says it sells its product to municipalities and related entities to not only increase bus speed (by removing obstructions) but also improve safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do that by [reducing] one of the biggest causes of collisions with buses—moving out of their lanes,” Territo added. “So the fewer times they have to make a turn, the fewer instances there are [of a crash].”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
            
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;As part of its setup process, the San Francisco-based startup says that it begins any installation by first mapping a city. Then it teaches the AI the local parking enforcement rules. Typically, those rules say that cars can’t block a bike or bus lane. Traditionally, Hayden AI’s cameras have only been mounted on buses, so enforcement was limited to existing routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We tell our system that if you see a vehicle that encroaches on a bike lane, capture a 10-second video and the license plate of that vehicle,” Territo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From there, an evidence package goes to the [police] and they will review and verify the elements—that a prosecutable violation exists—and then they will issue a violation under [state law]. If there is no violation, the system doesn’t capture any data. The system is only looking for scenarios where a bike lane is blocked and a license plate is evident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local bike advocates have applauded this expansion of automated enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Enforcement cannot be everywhere at once. If we can extend their arm so these things can get done, and keep our community safe, that is a win,” Cynthia Rose, the director of Santa Monica Spoke, told Ars. While warning of the potential misuse of bulk data collection in general, Rose was on board with Hayden AI’s particular plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anywhere where there’s bike infrastructure, where I know of, [blocking the lane] is a problem,” Rose said. “It’s tantamount to parking in handicapped zones. It’s just a flat no.”&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Speaking at the company’s fourth-quarter conference call, Chesky said the company wants to increase its use of large language models for customer discovery, support and engineering. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are building an AI-native experience where the app does not just search for you. It knows you. It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company separately said it is testing a new feature that lets users search and ask questions about properties and locations using natural language queries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently, Airbnb offers an LLM-powered customer service bot, for some personalization, and communications. The new AI search feature is expected to “evolve into a more comprehensive and intuitive search experience that extends through the trip.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questioned by analyst whether Airbnb would roll out sponsored property slots within AI search, Chesky said the company wants to get the design and user experience right first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI search is live to a very small percentage of traffic right now. We are doing a lot of experimentation. Over time, we are gonna be experimenting with making AI search more conversational, integrating it into more than the trip, and, eventually, we will be looking at sponsor listings as a result of that,” Chesky said, adding that Airbnb would consider designing an ad unit that fits the conversational search flow.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chesky said Airbnb plans to tap the AI expertise of its new CTO, Ahmad Al-Dahle (he worked on Meta’s  Llama models previously), to use its trove of identity and review data to make the app more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Airbnb claimed its AI-powered customer support bot, launched in North America last year, now handles a third of customer problems without needing any human intervention. Chesky noted there are plans to enable customers to call the AI bot for support, and expand language coverage to customer support as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A year from now, if we are successful, significantly more than 30% of tickets will be handled by a custom service agent, in many more languages, in all the languages where we have live agents. AI customer service will not only be chat, it will be voice,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is also thinking about increasing AI usage internally. Airbnb said 80% of its engineers use AI tools, but the goal is to get to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Airbnb reported better-than-expected revenue of $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, up 12% from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/brian-chesky-GettyImages-2217178973.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Airbnb has taken its time to launch AI features within the app, but CEO Brian Chesky on Friday said the company is now planning to bake in features powered by large language models that would help users search for listings, plan their trips, and aid hosts in managing their properties.&lt;/p&gt;
