Summer and winter tend to see the highest electricity demand, so plant operators schedule maintenance and refueling for other parts of the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This scheduled regularity might seem mundane, but it’s quite the feat that operational reactors are as reliable and predictable as they are. It leaves some big shoes to fill for next-generation technology hoping to join the fleet in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Generally, nuclear reactors operate at constant levels, as close to full capacity as possible. In 2024, for commercial reactors worldwide, the average capacity factor—the ratio of actual energy output to the theoretical maxiumum—was 83%. North America rang in at an average of about 90%.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;(I’ll note here that it’s not always fair to just look at this number to compare different kinds of power plants—natural-gas plants can have lower capacity factors, but it’s mostly because they’re more likely to be intentionally turned on and off to help meet uneven demand.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those high capacity factors also undersell the fleet’s true reliability—a lot of the downtime is scheduled. Reactors need to refuel every 18 to 24 months, and operators tend to schedule those outages for the spring and fall, when electricity demand isn’t as high as when we’re all running our air conditioners or heaters at full tilt.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1128760" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-03-at-5.00.44-PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Take a look at this chart of nuclear outages from the US Energy Information Administration. There are some days, especially at the height of summer, when outages are low, and nearly all commercial reactors in the US are operating at nearly full capacity. On July 28 of this year, the fleet was operating at 99.6%. Compare that with&amp;nbsp; the 77.6% of capacity on October 18, as reactors were taken offline for refueling and maintenance. Now we’re heading into another busy season, when reactors are coming back online and shutdowns are entering another low point.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s not to say all outages are planned. At the Sequoyah nuclear power plant in Tennessee, a generator failure in July 2024 took one of two reactors offline, an outage that lasted nearly a year. (The utility also did some maintenance during that time to extend the life of the plant.) Then, just days after that reactor started back up, the entire plant had to shut down because of low water levels.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And who can forget the incident earlier this year when jellyfish wreaked havoc on not one but two nuclear power plants in France? In the second instance, the squishy creatures got into the filters of equipment that sucks water out of the English Channel for cooling at the Paluel nuclear plant. They forced the plant to cut output by nearly half, though it was restored within days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barring jellyfish disasters and occasional maintenance, the global nuclear fleet operates quite reliably. That wasn’t always the case, though. In the 1970s, reactors operated at an average capacity factor of just 60%. They were shut down nearly as often as they were running.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fleet of reactors today has benefited from decades of experience. Now we’re seeing a growing pool of companies aiming to bring new technologies to the nuclear industry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next-generation reactors that use new materials for fuel or cooling will be able to borrow some lessons from the existing fleet, but they’ll also face novel challenges.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That could mean early demonstration reactors aren’t as reliable as the current commercial fleet at first. “First-of-a-kind nuclear, just like with any other first-of-a-kind technologies, is very challenging,” says Koroush Shirvan, a professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That means it will probably take time for molten-salt reactors or small modular reactors, or any of the other designs out there to overcome technical hurdles and settle into their own rhythm. It’s taken decades to get to a place where we take it for granted that the nuclear fleet can follow a neat seasonal curve based on electricity demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There will always be hurricanes and electrical failures and jellyfish invasions that cause some unexpected problems and force nuclear plants (or any power plants, for that matter) to shut down. But overall, the fleet today operates at an extremely high level of consistency. One of the major challenges ahead for next-generation technologies will be proving that they can do the same.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm will back AI startups and seek out India-focused startups in consumer, fintech, and digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI has soaked up most of the venture capital raised globally and the 20-year-old VC firm also sees AI as a defining technological shift. But it argues crowding into a single, overheated category carries its own risks. India’s digital economy provides a counterbalance: an expanding market where AI adoption is rising and opportunities remain more diverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Nexus, that balance is rooted in its origins. The Delaware-headquartered firm, with offices in Menlo Park, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, has operated as a single fund and an integrated U.S.–India team since its founding in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It backs early-stage software and India-focused startups from the same pool of capital. Over time, its cross-border software bets have encompassed a range from infrastructure and developer tools to AI agent startups. U.S. portfolio includes companies such as Postman, Apollo, MinIO, Giga, and Firecrawl, which have become widely adopted in developer tooling and AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, its India portfolio has broadened across consumer, fintech, logistics, and digital infrastructure. Some of its bets there include Zepto, Delhivery, Rapido, Turtlemint, and Infra.Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI is a huge inflection point, and we are anchoring on that,” Jishnu Bhattacharjee, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch in an interview. “But we are also seeing that many of these AI innovations are actually getting used to serve the masses better.”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nexus manages $3.2 billion in capital across its funds and has invested in more than 130 companies over the years. The firm has recorded more than 30 exits to date, including several IPOs, underscoring the depth of its early-stage, long-horizon approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Abhishek Sharma, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch the firm’s sweet spot remains inception to seed and Series A, often beginning with checks as small as a few hundred thousand dollars or around $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nexus, which operates with an eight-member investment team, began with a $100 million fund and has kept its fund size at $700 million since launching Fund VII in 2023. It typically raises every 2.5 to 3 years. Bhattacharjee said the reason for keeping the eighth fund the same size was the firm believes $700 million is the right amount for its early-stage strategy.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We don’t want to raise money for the sake of raising,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even though India’s AI journey is not as advanced as the U.S.’s in many areas, Nexus believes India could leapfrog in several parts of the AI ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bhattacharjee underlined the country’s large talent pool, rising digital infrastructure, and demand for localized models that support India’s many languages and service needs. These dynamics, he said, are pushing Indian startups to build AI applications and agents faster, often atop open source tools and emerging domestic AI infrastructure companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partners pointed to companies backed by Nexus, such as Zepto and Neysa, to illustrate how AI is taking shape in India. They said Zepto, the quick-commerce platform, uses AI extensively across its operations — from customer support to routing and fulfillment — demonstrating how consumer businesses are becoming deeply AI-native. Besides, infrastructure players like Neysa are emerging to address India-specific needs, including sovereign AI workloads, localized data handling, and support for the country’s many languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nexus did not share fund metrics. The partners said its funds have been realizing significant enough returns over the years to largely fill this fund from returning limited partners. The firm’s LP base spans the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every technological innovation of the past several years has been laser-focused on one thing: generative AI. Many of these supposedly revolutionary systems run on big, expensive servers in a data center somewhere, but at the same time, chipmakers are crowing about the power of the neural processing units (NPU) they have brought to consumer devices. Every few months, it’s the same thing: This new NPU is 30 or 40 percent faster than the last one. That’s supposed to let you do something important, but no one really gets around to explaining what that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts envision a future of secure, personal AI tools with on-device intelligence, but does that match the reality of the AI boom? AI on the “edge” sounds great, but almost every AI tool of consequence is running in the cloud. So what’s that chip in your phone even doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is an NPU?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies launching a new product often get bogged down in superlatives and vague marketing speak, so they do a poor job of explaining technical details. It’s not clear to most people buying a phone why they need the hardware to run AI workloads, and the supposed benefits are largely theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of today’s flagship consumer processors are systems-on-a-chip (SoC) because they incorporate multiple computing elements—like CPU cores, GPUs, and imaging controllers—on a single piece of silicon. This is true of mobile parts like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon or Google’s Tensor, as well as PC components like the Intel Core Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NPU is a newer addition to chips, but it didn’t just appear one day—there’s a lineage that brought us here. NPUs are good at what they do because they emphasize parallel computing, something that’s also important in other SoC components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm devotes significant time during its new product unveilings to talk about its Hexagon NPUs. Keen observers may recall that this branding has been reused from the company’s line of digital signal processors (DSPs), and there’s a good reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our journey into AI processing started probably 15 or 20 years ago, wherein our first anchor point was looking at signal processing,” said Vinesh Sukumar, Qualcomm’s head of AI products. DSPs have a similar architecture compared to NPUs, but they’re much simpler, with a focus on processing audio (e.g., speech recognition) and modem signals.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;

      The NPU is one of multiple components in modern SoCs.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the collection of technologies we refer to as “artificial intelligence” developed, engineers began using DSPs for more types of parallel processing, like long short-term memory (LSTM). Sukumar explained that as the industry became enamored with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the technology underlying applications like computer vision, DSPs became focused on matrix functions, which are essential to generative AI processing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is an architectural lineage here, it’s not quite right to say NPUs are just fancy DSPs. “If you talk about DSPs in the general term of the word, yes, [an NPU] is a digital signal processor,” said MediaTek Assistant Vice President Mark Odani. “But it’s all come a long way and it’s a lot more optimized for parallelism, how the transformers work, and holding huge numbers of parameters for processing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being so prominent in new chips, NPUs are not strictly necessary for running AI workloads on the “edge,” a term that differentiates local AI processing from cloud-based systems. CPUs are slower than NPUs but can handle some light workloads without using as much power. Meanwhile, GPUs can often chew through more data than an NPU, but they use more power to do it. And there are times you may want to do that, according to Qualcomm’s Sukumar. For example, running AI workloads while a game is running could favor the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here, your measurement of success is that you cannot drop your frame rate while maintaining the spatial resolution, the dynamic range of the pixel, and also being able to provide AI recommendations for the player within that space,” says Sukumar. “In this kind of use case, it actually makes sense to run that in the graphics engine, because then you don’t have to keep shifting between the graphics and a domain-specific AI engine like an NPU.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Livin’ on the edge is hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the NPUs in many devices sit idle (and not just during gaming). The mix of local versus cloud AI tools favors the latter because that’s the natural habitat of LLMs. AI models are trained and fine-tuned on powerful servers, and that’s where they run best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A server-based AI, like the full-fat versions of Gemini and ChatGPT, is not resource-constrained like a model running on your phone’s NPU. Consider the latest version of Google’s on-device Gemini Nano model, which has a context window of 32k tokens. That is a more than 2x improvement over the last version. However, the cloud-based Gemini models have context windows of up to 1 million tokens, meaning they can process much larger volumes of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both cloud-based and edge AI hardware will continue getting better, but the balance may not shift in the NPU’s favor. “The cloud will always have more compute resources versus a mobile device,” said Google’s Shenaz Zack, senior product manager on the Pixel team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you want the most accurate models or the most brute force models, that all has to be done in the cloud,” Odani said. “But what we’re finding is that, in a lot of the use cases where there’s just summarizing some text or you’re talking to your voice assistant, a lot of those things can fit within three billion parameters.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Squeezing AI models onto a phone or laptop involves some compromise—for example, by reducing the parameters included in the model. Odani explained that cloud-based models run hundreds of billions of parameters, the weighting that determines how a model processes input tokens to generate outputs. You can’t run anything like that on a consumer device right now, so developers have to vastly scale back the size of models for the edge. Odani says MediaTek’s latest ninth-generation NPU can handle about 3 billion parameters—a difference of several orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of memory available in a phone or laptop is also a limiting factor, so mobile-optimized AI models are usually quantized. That means the model’s estimation of the next token runs with less precision. Let’s say you want to run one of the larger open models, like Llama or Gemma 7b, on your device. The de facto standard is FP16, known as half-precision. At that level, a model with 7 billion parameters will lock up 13 or 14 gigabytes of memory. Stepping down to FP4 (quarter-precision) brings the size of the model in memory to a few gigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you compress to, let’s say, between three and four gigabytes, it’s a sweet spot for integration into memory constrained form factors like a smartphone,” Sukumar said. “And there’s been a lot of investment in the ecosystem and at Qualcomm to look at various ways of compressing the models without losing quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to create a generalized AI with these limitations for mobile devices, but computers—and especially smartphones—are a wellspring of data that can be pumped into models to generate supposedly helpful outputs. That’s why most edge AI is geared toward specific, narrow use cases, like analyzing screenshots or suggesting calendar appointments. Google says its latest Pixel phones run more than 100 AI models, both generative and traditional.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Even AI skeptics can recognize that the landscape is changing quickly. In the time it takes to shrink and optimize AI models for a phone or laptop, new cloud models may appear that make that work obsolete. This is also why third-party developers have been slow to utilize NPU processing in apps. They either have to plug into an existing on-device model, which involves restrictions and rapidly moving development targets, or deploy their own custom models. Neither is a great option currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A matter of trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the cloud is faster and easier, why go to the trouble of optimizing for the edge and burning more power with an NPU? Leaning on the cloud means accepting a level of dependence and trust in the people operating AI data centers that may not always be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We always start off with user privacy as an element,” said Qualcomm’s Sukumar. He explained that the best inference is not general in nature—it’s personalized based on the user’s interests and what’s happening in their lives. Fine-tuning models to deliver that experience calls for personal data, and it’s safer to store and process that data locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when companies say the right things about privacy in their cloud services, they’re far from guarantees. The helpful, friendly vibe of general chatbots also encourages people to divulge a lot of personal information, and if that assistant is running in the cloud, your data is there as well. OpenAI’s copyright fight with The New York Times could lead to millions of private chats being handed over to the publisher. The explosive growth and uncertain regulatory framework of gen AI make it hard to know what’s going to happen to your data.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“People are using a lot of these generative AI assistants like a therapist,” Odani said. “And you don’t know one day if all this stuff is going to come out on the Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is so concerned. Zack claims Google has built “the world’s most secure cloud infrastructure,” allowing it to process data where it delivers the best results. Zack uses Video Boost and Pixel Studio as examples of this approach, noting that Google’s cloud is the only way to make these experiences fast and high-quality. The company recently announced its new Private AI Compute system, which it claims is just as safe as local AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if that’s true, the edge has other advantages—edge AI is just more reliable than a cloud service. “On-device is fast,” Odani said. “Sometimes I’m talking to ChatGPT and my Wi-Fi goes out or whatever, and it skips a beat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The services hosting cloud-based AI models aren’t just a single website—the Internet of today is massively interdependent, with content delivery networks, DNS providers, hosting, and other services that could degrade or shut down your favorite AI in the event of a glitch. When Cloudflare suffered a self-inflicted outage recently, ChatGPT users were annoyed to find their trusty chatbot was unavailable. Local AI features don’t have that drawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloud dominance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to agree that a hybrid approach is necessary to deliver truly useful AI features (assuming those exist), sending data to more powerful cloud services when necessary—Google, Apple, and every other phone maker does this. But the pursuit of a seamless experience can also obscure what’s happening with your data. More often than not, the AI features on your phone aren’t running in a secure, local way, even when the device has the hardware to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the new OnePlus 15. This phone has Qualcomm’s brand-new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, which has an NPU that is 37 percent faster than the last one, for whatever that’s worth. Even with all that on-device AI might, OnePlus is heavily reliant on the cloud to analyze your personal data. Features like AI Writer and the AI Recorder connect to the company’s servers for processing, a system OnePlus assures us is totally safe and private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Motorola released a new line of foldable Razr phones over the summer that are loaded with AI features from multiple providers. These phones can summarize your notifications using AI, but you might be surprised how much of it happens in the cloud unless you read the terms and conditions. If you buy the Razr Ultra, that summarization happens on your phone. However, the cheaper models with less RAM and NPU power use cloud services to process your notifications. Again, Motorola says this system is secure, but a more secure option would have been to re-optimize the model for its cheaper phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when an OEM focuses on using the NPU hardware, the results can be lacking. Look at Google’s Daily Hub and Samsung’s Now Brief. These features are supposed to chew through all the data on your phone and generate useful recommendations and actions, but they rarely do anything aside from showing calendar events. In fact, Google has temporarily removed Daily Hub from Pixels because the feature did so little, and Google is a pioneer in local AI with Gemini Nano. Google has actually moved some parts of its mobile AI experience from local to cloud-based processing in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those “brute force” models appear to be winning, and it doesn’t hurt that companies also get more data when you interact with their private computing cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maybe take what you can get?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of interest in local AI, but so far, that hasn’t translated to an AI revolution in your pocket. Most of the AI advances we’ve seen so far depend on the ever-increasing scale of cloud systems and the generalized models that run there. Industry experts say that extensive work is happening behind the scenes to shrink AI models to work on phones and laptops, but it will take time for that to make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, local AI processing is out there in a limited way. Google still makes use of the Tensor NPU to handle sensitive data for features like Magic Cue, and Samsung really makes the most of Qualcomm’s AI-focused chipsets. While Now Brief is of questionable utility, Samsung is cognizant of how reliance on the cloud may impact users, offering a toggle in the system settings that restricts AI processing to run only on the device. This limits the number of available AI features, and others don’t work as well, but you’ll know none of your personal data is being shared. No one else offers this option on a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung spokesperson Elise Sembach said the company’s AI efforts are grounded in enhancing experiences while maintaining user control. “The on-device processing toggle in One UI reflects this approach. It gives users the option to process AI tasks locally for faster performance, added privacy, and reliability even without a network connection,” Sembach said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in edge AI might be a good thing even if you don’t use it. Planning for this AI-rich future can encourage device makers to invest in better hardware—like more memory to run all those theoretical AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We definitely recommend our partners increase their RAM capacity,” said Sukumar. Indeed, Google, Samsung, and others have boosted memory capacity in large part to support on-device AI. Even if the cloud is winning, we’ll take the extra RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every technological innovation of the past several years has been laser-focused on one thing: generative AI. Many of these supposedly revolutionary systems run on big, expensive servers in a data center somewhere, but at the same time, chipmakers are crowing about the power of the neural processing units (NPU) they have brought to consumer devices. Every few months, it’s the same thing: This new NPU is 30 or 40 percent faster than the last one. That’s supposed to let you do something important, but no one really gets around to explaining what that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts envision a future of secure, personal AI tools with on-device intelligence, but does that match the reality of the AI boom? AI on the “edge” sounds great, but almost every AI tool of consequence is running in the cloud. So what’s that chip in your phone even doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is an NPU?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies launching a new product often get bogged down in superlatives and vague marketing speak, so they do a poor job of explaining technical details. It’s not clear to most people buying a phone why they need the hardware to run AI workloads, and the supposed benefits are largely theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of today’s flagship consumer processors are systems-on-a-chip (SoC) because they incorporate multiple computing elements—like CPU cores, GPUs, and imaging controllers—on a single piece of silicon. This is true of mobile parts like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon or Google’s Tensor, as well as PC components like the Intel Core Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NPU is a newer addition to chips, but it didn’t just appear one day—there’s a lineage that brought us here. NPUs are good at what they do because they emphasize parallel computing, something that’s also important in other SoC components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm devotes significant time during its new product unveilings to talk about its Hexagon NPUs. Keen observers may recall that this branding has been reused from the company’s line of digital signal processors (DSPs), and there’s a good reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our journey into AI processing started probably 15 or 20 years ago, wherein our first anchor point was looking at signal processing,” said Vinesh Sukumar, Qualcomm’s head of AI products. DSPs have a similar architecture compared to NPUs, but they’re much simpler, with a focus on processing audio (e.g., speech recognition) and modem signals.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the collection of technologies we refer to as “artificial intelligence” developed, engineers began using DSPs for more types of parallel processing, like long short-term memory (LSTM). Sukumar explained that as the industry became enamored with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the technology underlying applications like computer vision, DSPs became focused on matrix functions, which are essential to generative AI processing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is an architectural lineage here, it’s not quite right to say NPUs are just fancy DSPs. “If you talk about DSPs in the general term of the word, yes, [an NPU] is a digital signal processor,” said MediaTek Assistant Vice President Mark Odani. “But it’s all come a long way and it’s a lot more optimized for parallelism, how the transformers work, and holding huge numbers of parameters for processing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being so prominent in new chips, NPUs are not strictly necessary for running AI workloads on the “edge,” a term that differentiates local AI processing from cloud-based systems. CPUs are slower than NPUs but can handle some light workloads without using as much power. Meanwhile, GPUs can often chew through more data than an NPU, but they use more power to do it. And there are times you may want to do that, according to Qualcomm’s Sukumar. For example, running AI workloads while a game is running could favor the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here, your measurement of success is that you cannot drop your frame rate while maintaining the spatial resolution, the dynamic range of the pixel, and also being able to provide AI recommendations for the player within that space,” says Sukumar. “In this kind of use case, it actually makes sense to run that in the graphics engine, because then you don’t have to keep shifting between the graphics and a domain-specific AI engine like an NPU.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Livin’ on the edge is hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the NPUs in many devices sit idle (and not just during gaming). The mix of local versus cloud AI tools favors the latter because that’s the natural habitat of LLMs. AI models are trained and fine-tuned on powerful servers, and that’s where they run best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A server-based AI, like the full-fat versions of Gemini and ChatGPT, is not resource-constrained like a model running on your phone’s NPU. Consider the latest version of Google’s on-device Gemini Nano model, which has a context window of 32k tokens. That is a more than 2x improvement over the last version. However, the cloud-based Gemini models have context windows of up to 1 million tokens, meaning they can process much larger volumes of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both cloud-based and edge AI hardware will continue getting better, but the balance may not shift in the NPU’s favor. “The cloud will always have more compute resources versus a mobile device,” said Google’s Shenaz Zack, senior product manager on the Pixel team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you want the most accurate models or the most brute force models, that all has to be done in the cloud,” Odani said. “But what we’re finding is that, in a lot of the use cases where there’s just summarizing some text or you’re talking to your voice assistant, a lot of those things can fit within three billion parameters.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Squeezing AI models onto a phone or laptop involves some compromise—for example, by reducing the parameters included in the model. Odani explained that cloud-based models run hundreds of billions of parameters, the weighting that determines how a model processes input tokens to generate outputs. You can’t run anything like that on a consumer device right now, so developers have to vastly scale back the size of models for the edge. Odani says MediaTek’s latest ninth-generation NPU can handle about 3 billion parameters—a difference of several orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of memory available in a phone or laptop is also a limiting factor, so mobile-optimized AI models are usually quantized. That means the model’s estimation of the next token runs with less precision. Let’s say you want to run one of the larger open models, like Llama or Gemma 7b, on your device. The de facto standard is FP16, known as half-precision. At that level, a model with 7 billion parameters will lock up 13 or 14 gigabytes of memory. Stepping down to FP4 (quarter-precision) brings the size of the model in memory to a few gigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you compress to, let’s say, between three and four gigabytes, it’s a sweet spot for integration into memory constrained form factors like a smartphone,” Sukumar said. “And there’s been a lot of investment in the ecosystem and at Qualcomm to look at various ways of compressing the models without losing quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to create a generalized AI with these limitations for mobile devices, but computers—and especially smartphones—are a wellspring of data that can be pumped into models to generate supposedly helpful outputs. That’s why most edge AI is geared toward specific, narrow use cases, like analyzing screenshots or suggesting calendar appointments. Google says its latest Pixel phones run more than 100 AI models, both generative and traditional.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Even AI skeptics can recognize that the landscape is changing quickly. In the time it takes to shrink and optimize AI models for a phone or laptop, new cloud models may appear that make that work obsolete. This is also why third-party developers have been slow to utilize NPU processing in apps. They either have to plug into an existing on-device model, which involves restrictions and rapidly moving development targets, or deploy their own custom models. Neither is a great option currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A matter of trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the cloud is faster and easier, why go to the trouble of optimizing for the edge and burning more power with an NPU? Leaning on the cloud means accepting a level of dependence and trust in the people operating AI data centers that may not always be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We always start off with user privacy as an element,” said Qualcomm’s Sukumar. He explained that the best inference is not general in nature—it’s personalized based on the user’s interests and what’s happening in their lives. Fine-tuning models to deliver that experience calls for personal data, and it’s safer to store and process that data locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when companies say the right things about privacy in their cloud services, they’re far from guarantees. The helpful, friendly vibe of general chatbots also encourages people to divulge a lot of personal information, and if that assistant is running in the cloud, your data is there as well. OpenAI’s copyright fight with The New York Times could lead to millions of private chats being handed over to the publisher. The explosive growth and uncertain regulatory framework of gen AI make it hard to know what’s going to happen to your data.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People are using a lot of these generative AI assistants like a therapist,” Odani said. “And you don’t know one day if all this stuff is going to come out on the Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is so concerned. Zack claims Google has built “the world’s most secure cloud infrastructure,” allowing it to process data where it delivers the best results. Zack uses Video Boost and Pixel Studio as examples of this approach, noting that Google’s cloud is the only way to make these experiences fast and high-quality. The company recently announced its new Private AI Compute system, which it claims is just as safe as local AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if that’s true, the edge has other advantages—edge AI is just more reliable than a cloud service. “On-device is fast,” Odani said. “Sometimes I’m talking to ChatGPT and my Wi-Fi goes out or whatever, and it skips a beat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The services hosting cloud-based AI models aren’t just a single website—the Internet of today is massively interdependent, with content delivery networks, DNS providers, hosting, and other services that could degrade or shut down your favorite AI in the event of a glitch. When Cloudflare suffered a self-inflicted outage recently, ChatGPT users were annoyed to find their trusty chatbot was unavailable. Local AI features don’t have that drawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloud dominance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to agree that a hybrid approach is necessary to deliver truly useful AI features (assuming those exist), sending data to more powerful cloud services when necessary—Google, Apple, and every other phone maker does this. But the pursuit of a seamless experience can also obscure what’s happening with your data. More often than not, the AI features on your phone aren’t running in a secure, local way, even when the device has the hardware to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the new OnePlus 15. This phone has Qualcomm’s brand-new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, which has an NPU that is 37 percent faster than the last one, for whatever that’s worth. Even with all that on-device AI might, OnePlus is heavily reliant on the cloud to analyze your personal data. Features like AI Writer and the AI Recorder connect to the company’s servers for processing, a system OnePlus assures us is totally safe and private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Motorola released a new line of foldable Razr phones over the summer that are loaded with AI features from multiple providers. These phones can summarize your notifications using AI, but you might be surprised how much of it happens in the cloud unless you read the terms and conditions. If you buy the Razr Ultra, that summarization happens on your phone. However, the cheaper models with less RAM and NPU power use cloud services to process your notifications. Again, Motorola says this system is secure, but a more secure option would have been to re-optimize the model for its cheaper phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when an OEM focuses on using the NPU hardware, the results can be lacking. Look at Google’s Daily Hub and Samsung’s Now Brief. These features are supposed to chew through all the data on your phone and generate useful recommendations and actions, but they rarely do anything aside from showing calendar events. In fact, Google has temporarily removed Daily Hub from Pixels because the feature did so little, and Google is a pioneer in local AI with Gemini Nano. Google has actually moved some parts of its mobile AI experience from local to cloud-based processing in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those “brute force” models appear to be winning, and it doesn’t hurt that companies also get more data when you interact with their private computing cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maybe take what you can get?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of interest in local AI, but so far, that hasn’t translated to an AI revolution in your pocket. Most of the AI advances we’ve seen so far depend on the ever-increasing scale of cloud systems and the generalized models that run there. Industry experts say that extensive work is happening behind the scenes to shrink AI models to work on phones and laptops, but it will take time for that to make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, local AI processing is out there in a limited way. Google still makes use of the Tensor NPU to handle sensitive data for features like Magic Cue, and Samsung really makes the most of Qualcomm’s AI-focused chipsets. While Now Brief is of questionable utility, Samsung is cognizant of how reliance on the cloud may impact users, offering a toggle in the system settings that restricts AI processing to run only on the device. This limits the number of available AI features, and others don’t work as well, but you’ll know none of your personal data is being shared. No one else offers this option on a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung spokesperson Elise Sembach said the company’s AI efforts are grounded in enhancing experiences while maintaining user control. “The on-device processing toggle in One UI reflects this approach. It gives users the option to process AI tasks locally for faster performance, added privacy, and reliability even without a network connection,” Sembach said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in edge AI might be a good thing even if you don’t use it. Planning for this AI-rich future can encourage device makers to invest in better hardware—like more memory to run all those theoretical AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We definitely recommend our partners increase their RAM capacity,” said Sukumar. Indeed, Google, Samsung, and others have boosted memory capacity in large part to support on-device AI. Even if the cloud is winning, we’ll take the extra RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

The industry’s obsession with chat interfaces has been replaced by a far more demanding mandate: “frontier agents” that don’t just talk, but work autonomously for days at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are moving from the novelty phase of generative AI into a grinding era of infrastructure economics and operational plumbing. The “wow” factor of a poem-writing bot has faded; now, the cheque comes due for the infrastructure needed to run these systems at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-addressing-the-plumbing-crisis-at-aws-re-invent-2025"&gt;Addressing the plumbing crisis at AWS re:Invent 2025&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, building frontier AI agents capable of executing complex, non-deterministic tasks was a bespoke engineering nightmare. Early adopters have been burning resources cobbling together tools to manage context, memory, and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS is trying to kill that complexity with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. It’s a managed service that acts as an operating system for agents, handling the backend work of state management and context retrieval. The efficiency gains from standardising this layer are hard to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take MongoDB. By ditching their home-brewed infrastructure for AgentCore, they consolidated their toolchain and pushed an agent-based application to production in eight weeks—a process that previously ate up months of evaluation and maintenance time. The PGA TOUR saw even sharper returns, using the platform to build a content generation system that increased writing speed by 1,000 percent while slashing costs by 95 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software teams are getting their own dedicated workforce, too. At re:Invent 2025, AWS rolled out three specific frontier AI agents: Kiro (a virtual developer), a Security Agent, and a DevOps Agent. Kiro isn’t just a code-completion tool; it hooks directly into workflows with “powers” (specialised integrations for tools like Datadog, Figma, and Stripe) that allow it to act with context rather than just guessing at syntax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agents that run for days consume massive amounts of compute. If you are paying standard on-demand rates for that, your ROI evaporates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS knows this, which is why the hardware announcements this year are aggressive. The new Trainium3 UltraServers, powered by 3nm chips, are claiming a 4.4x jump in compute performance over the previous generation. For the organisations training massive foundation models, this cuts training timelines from months to weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the more interesting shift is where that compute lives. Data sovereignty remains a headache for global enterprises, often blocking cloud adoption for sensitive AI workloads. AWS is countering this with ‘AI Factories’ (essentially shipping racks of Trainium chips and NVIDIA GPUs directly into customers’ existing data centres.) It’s a hybrid play that acknowledges a simple truth: for some data, the public cloud is still too far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tackling-the-legacy-mountain"&gt;Tackling the legacy mountain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation like we’re seeing with frontier AI agents is great, but most IT budgets are strangled by technical debt. Teams spend roughly 30 percent of their time just keeping the lights on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During re:Invent 2025, Amazon updated AWS Transform to attack this specifically; using agentic AI to handle the grunt work of upgrading legacy code. The service can now handle full-stack Windows modernisation; including upgrading .NET apps and SQL Server databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air Canada used this to modernise thousands of Lambda functions. They finished in days. Doing it manually would have cost them five times as much and taken weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers who actually want to write code, the ecosystem is widening. The Strands Agents SDK, previously a Python-only affair, now supports TypeScript. As the lingua franca of the web, it brings type safety to the chaotic output of LLMs and is a necessary evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sensible-governance-in-the-era-of-frontier-ai-agents"&gt;Sensible governance in the era of frontier AI agents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a danger here. An agent that works autonomously for “days without intervention” is also an agent that can wreck a database or leak PII without anyone noticing until it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS is attempting to wrap this risk in ‘AgentCore Policy,’ a feature allowing teams to set natural language boundaries on what an agent can and cannot do. Coupled with ‘Evaluations,’ which uses pre-built metrics to monitor agent performance, it provides a much-needed safety net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security teams also get a boost with updates to Security Hub, which now correlates signals from GuardDuty, Inspector, and Macie into single “events” rather than flooding the dashboard with isolated alerts. GuardDuty itself is expanding, using ML to detect complex threat patterns across EC2 and ECS clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are clearly past the point of pilot programs.

But in other places, they’re obscured thousands of feet underground. Now AI could help uncover these hidden pockets of potential power.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A startup company called Zanskar announced today that it’s used AI and other advanced computational methods to uncover a blind geothermal system—meaning there aren’t signs of it on the surface—in the western Nevada desert. The company says it’s the first blind system that’s been identified and confirmed to be a commercial prospect in over 30 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Historically, finding new sites for geothermal power was a matter of brute force. Companies spent a lot of time and money drilling deep wells, looking for places where it made sense to build a plant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zanskar’s approach is more precise. With advancements in AI, the company aims to “solve this problem that had been unsolvable for decades, and go and finally find those resources and prove that they’re way bigger than previously thought,” says Carl Hoiland, the company’s cofounder and CEO.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To support a successful geothermal power plant, a site needs high temperatures at an accessible depth and space for fluid to move through the rock and deliver heat. In the case of the new site, which the company calls Big Blind, the prize is a reservoir that reaches 250 °F at about 2,700 feet below the surface.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As electricity demand rises around the world, geothermal systems like this one could provide a source of constant power without emitting the greenhouse gases that cause climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The company has used its technology to identify many potential hot spots. “We have dozens of sites that look just like this,” says Joel Edwards, Zanskar’s cofounder and CTO. But for Big Blind, the team has done the fieldwork to confirm its model’s predictions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first step to identifying a new site is to use regional AI models to search large areas. The team trains models on known hot spots and on simulations it creates. Then it feeds in geological, satellite, and other types of data, including information about fault lines. The models can then predict where potential hot spots might be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI.

With that lease secured, the team returned with large drill rigs and drilled thousands of feet down in July and August. The workers found the hot, permeable rock they expected.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next they must secure permits to build and connect to the grid and line up the investments needed to build the plant. The team will also continue testing at the site, including long-term testing to track heat and water flow.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s a tremendous need for methodology that can look for large-scale features,” says John McLennan, technical lead for resource management at Utah FORGE, a national lab field site for geothermal energy funded by the US Department of Energy. The new discovery is “promising,” McLennan adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Big Blind is Zanskar’s first confirmed discovery that wasn’t previously explored or developed, but the company has used its tools for other geothermal exploration projects. Earlier this year, it announced a discovery at a site that had previously been explored by the industry but not developed. The company also purchased and revived a geothermal power plant in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And this could be just the beginning for Zanskar. As Edwards puts it, “This is the start of a wave of new, naturally occurring geothermal systems that will have enough heat in place to support power plants.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LDG-rig-and-flow-test.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes geothermal hot spots are obvious, marked by geysers and hot springs on the planet’s surface.

Summer and winter tend to see the highest electricity demand, so plant operators schedule maintenance and refueling for other parts of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scheduled regularity might seem mundane, but it’s quite the feat that operational reactors are as reliable and predictable as they are.

 &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How AI is uncovering hidden geothermal energy resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes geothermal hot spots are obvious, marked by geysers and hot springs on Earth’s surface. But in other places, they’re obscured thousands of feet underground. Now AI could help uncover these hidden pockets of potential power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A startup company called Zanskar announced today that it’s used AI and other advanced computational methods to uncover a blind geothermal system—meaning there aren’t signs of it on the surface—in the western Nevada desert. The company says it’s the first blind system that’s been identified and confirmed to be a commercial prospect in over 30 years. Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

The finding marks a dramatic shift from just two years ago, when most organizations treated AI as an experimental technology relegated to pilot programs and individual productivity hacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, based on an analysis of 7.1 million sales opportunities across more than 3,600 companies and a survey of over 3,000 global revenue leaders spanning the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany, paints a picture of an industry in rapid transformation. Organizations that have embedded AI into their core go-to-market strategies are 65 percent more likely to increase their win rates than competitors still treating the technology as optional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#x27;t think people delegate decisions to AI, but they do rely on AI in the process of making decisions,&amp;quot; Amit Bendov, Gong&amp;#x27;s co-founder and chief executive, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;Humans are making the decision, but they&amp;#x27;re largely assisted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction matters. Rather than replacing human judgment, AI has become what Bendov describes as a &amp;quot;second opinion&amp;quot; — a data-driven check on the intuition and guesswork that has traditionally governed sales forecasting and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slowing growth is forcing sales teams to squeeze more from every rep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of AI&amp;#x27;s ascendance in revenue organizations is no coincidence. The study reveals a sobering reality: after rebounding in 2024, average annual revenue growth among surveyed companies decelerated to 16 percent in 2025, marking a three-percentage-point decline year over year. Sales rep quota attainment fell from 52 percent to 46 percent over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culprit, according to Gong&amp;#x27;s analysis, isn&amp;#x27;t that salespeople are performing worse on individual deals. Win rates and deal duration remained consistent. The problem is that representatives are working fewer opportunities—a finding that suggests operational inefficiencies are eating into selling time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why productivity has rocketed to the top of executive priorities. For the first time in the study&amp;#x27;s history, increasing the productivity of existing teams ranked as the number-one growth strategy for 2026, jumping from fourth place the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The focus is on increasing sales productivity,&amp;quot; Bendov said. &amp;quot;How much dollar-output per dollar-input.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers back up the urgency. Teams where sellers regularly use AI tools generate 77 percent more revenue per representative than those that don&amp;#x27;t — a gap Gong characterizes as a six-figure difference per salesperson annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Companies are moving beyond basic AI automation toward strategic decision-making&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nature of AI adoption in sales has evolved considerably over the past year. In 2024, most revenue teams used AI for basic automation: transcribing calls, drafting emails, updating CRM records. Those use cases continue to grow, but 2025 marked what the report calls a shift &amp;quot;from automation to intelligence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of U.S. companies using AI for forecasting and measuring strategic initiatives jumped 50 percent year over year. These more sophisticated applications — predicting deal outcomes, identifying at-risk accounts, measuring which value propositions resonate with different buyer personas — correlate with dramatically better results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations in the 95th percentile of commercial impact from AI were two to four times more likely to have deployed these strategic use cases, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bendov offered a concrete example of how this plays out in practice. &amp;quot;Companies have thousands of deals that they roll up into their forecast,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It used to be based solely on human sentiment—believe it or not. That&amp;#x27;s why a lot of companies miss their numbers: because people say, &amp;#x27;Oh, he told me he&amp;#x27;ll buy,&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;I think I can probably get this one.&amp;#x27;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI changes that calculus by examining evidence rather than optimism. &amp;quot;Companies now get a second opinion from AI on their forecasting, and that improves forecasting accuracy dramatically — 10 [or] 15 percent better accuracy just because it&amp;#x27;s evidence-based, not just based on human sentiment,&amp;quot; Bendov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revenue-specific AI tools are dramatically outperforming general-purpose alternatives&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the study&amp;#x27;s more provocative findings concerns the type of AI that delivers results. Teams using revenue-specific AI solutions — tools built explicitly for sales workflows rather than general-purpose platforms like ChatGPT — reported 13 percent higher revenue growth and 85 percent greater commercial impact than those relying on generic tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These specialized systems were also twice as likely to be deployed for forecasting and predictive modeling, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding carries obvious implications for Gong, which sells precisely this type of domain-specific platform. But the data suggests a real distinction in outcomes. General-purpose AI, while more prevalent, often creates what the report describes as a &amp;quot;blind spot&amp;quot; for organizations — particularly when employees adopt consumer AI tools without company oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/mit-report-misunderstood-shadow-ai-economy-booms-while-headlines-cry-failure"&gt;Research from MIT&lt;/a&gt; suggests that while only 59 percent of survey respondents said their teams use personal AI tools like ChatGPT at work, the actual figure is likely closer to 90 percent. This shadow AI usage poses security risks and creates fragmented technology stacks that undermine the potential for organization-wide intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most sales leaders believe AI will reshape their jobs rather than eliminate them&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most closely watched question in any AI study concerns employment. The Gong research offers a more nuanced picture than the apocalyptic predictions that often dominate headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about AI&amp;#x27;s three-year impact on revenue headcount, 43 percent of respondents said they expect it to transform jobs without reducing headcount — the most common response. Only 28 percent anticipate job eliminations, while 21 percent actually foresee AI creating new roles. Just 8 percent predict minimal impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bendov frames the opportunity in terms of reclaiming lost time. He cited &lt;a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/use-science-to-improve-sales-productivity/"&gt;Forrester research &lt;/a&gt;indicating that &lt;a href="https://www.crmbuyer.com/story/gong-ai-platform-delivers-improved-accuracy-to-revenue-forecasting-177228.html"&gt;77 percent&lt;/a&gt; of a sales representative&amp;#x27;s time is spent on activities that don&amp;#x27;t involve customers — administrative work, meeting preparation, researching accounts, updating forecasts, and internal briefings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;AI can eliminate, ideally, all 77 percent—all the drudgery work that they&amp;#x27;re doing,&amp;quot; Bendov said. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#x27;t think it necessarily eliminates jobs. People are half productive right now. Let&amp;#x27;s make them fully productive, and whatever you&amp;#x27;re paying them will translate to much higher revenue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation is already visible in role consolidation. Over the past decade, sales organizations splintered into hyper-specialized functions: one person qualifies leads, another sets appointments, a third closes deals, a fourth handles onboarding. The result was customers interacting with five or six different people across their buying journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Which is not a great buyer experience, because every time I meet a new person that might not have the full context, and it&amp;#x27;s very inefficient for companies,&amp;quot; Bendov said. &amp;quot;Now with AI, you can have one person do all this, or much of this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Gong itself, sellers now generate 80 percent of their own appointments because AI handles the prospecting legwork, Bendov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;American companies are adopting AI 18 months faster than their European counterparts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reveals a notable divide in AI adoption between the United States and Europe. While 87 percent of U.S. companies now use AI in their revenue operations, with another 9 percent planning adoption within a year, the United Kingdom trails by 12 to 18 months. Just 70 percent of UK companies currently use AI, with 22 percent planning near-term adoption — figures that mirror U.S. data from 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bendov said the pattern reflects a broader historical tendency for enterprise technology trends to cross the Atlantic with a delay. &amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s always like that,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Even when the internet was taking off in the US, Europe was a step behind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gap isn&amp;#x27;t permanent, he noted, and Europe sometimes leads on technology adoption — mobile payments and messaging apps like WhatsApp gained traction there before the U.S. — but for AI specifically, the American market remains ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gong says a decade of AI development gives it an edge over Salesforce and Microsoft&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings arrive as Gong navigates an increasingly crowded market. The company, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.gong.io/press/gong-surpasses-300m-arr-amid-increased-demand-for-ai-powered-revenue-solutions"&gt;surpassed $300 million&lt;/a&gt; in annual recurring revenue, faces potential competition from enterprise software giants like &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/"&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are embedding AI capabilities into their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bendov argues that Gong&amp;#x27;s decade of AI development creates a substantial barrier to entry. The company&amp;#x27;s architecture comprises three layers: a &amp;quot;revenue graph&amp;quot; that aggregates customer data from CRM systems, emails, calls, videos, and web signals; an intelligence layer combining large language models with approximately 40 proprietary small language models; and workflow applications built on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anybody that would want to build something like that—it&amp;#x27;s not a small feature, it&amp;#x27;s 10 years in development—would need first to build the revenue graph,&amp;quot; Bendov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than viewing Salesforce and Microsoft as threats, Bendov characterized them as partners, pointing to both companies&amp;#x27; participation in Gong&amp;#x27;s recent user conference to discuss agent interoperability. The rise of MCP (&lt;a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro"&gt;Model Context Protocol&lt;/a&gt;) support and consumption-based pricing models means customers can mix AI agents from multiple vendors rather than committing to a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The real question is whether AI will expand the sales profession or hollow it out&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report&amp;#x27;s implications extend beyond sales departments. If AI can transform revenue operations — long considered a relationship-driven, human-centric function — it raises questions about which other business processes might be next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bendov sees the potential for expansion rather than contraction. Drawing an analogy to digital photography, he noted that while camera manufacturers suffered, the total number of photos taken exploded once smartphones made photography effortless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If AI makes selling simple, I could see a world—I don&amp;#x27;t know exactly what it looks like yet—but why not?&amp;quot; Bendov said. &amp;quot;Maybe ten times more jobs than we have now. It&amp;#x27;s expensive and inefficient today, but if it becomes as easy as taking a photo, the industry could actually grow and create opportunities for people of different abilities, from different locations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Bendov, who co-founded Gong in 2015 when AI was still a hard sell to non-technical business users, the current moment represents something he waited a decade to see. Back then, mentioning AI to sales executives sounded like science fiction. The company struggled to raise money because the underlying technology barely existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When we started the company, we were born as an AI company, but we had to almost hide AI,&amp;quot; Bendov recalled. &amp;quot;It was intimidating.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, seven out of ten of those same executives say they trust AI to help run their business. The technology that once had to be disguised has become the one thing nobody can afford to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;The debate over whether artificial intelligence belongs in the corporate boardroom appears to be over — at least for the people responsible for generating revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven in ten enterprise revenue leaders now trust AI to regularly inform their business decisions, according to &lt;a href="https://www.gong.io/resources/guides/state-of-revenue-ai-2026-report"&gt;a sweeping new study released Thursday by Gong&lt;/a&gt;, the revenue intelligence company. The finding marks a dramatic shift from just two years ago, when most organizations treated AI as an experimental technology relegated to pilot programs and individual productivity hacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, based on an analysis of 7.1 million sales opportunities across more than 3,600 companies and a survey of over 3,000 global revenue leaders spanning the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany, paints a picture of an industry in rapid transformation. Organizations that have embedded AI into their core go-to-market strategies are 65 percent more likely to increase their win rates than competitors still treating the technology as optional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#x27;t think people delegate decisions to AI, but they do rely on AI in the process of making decisions,&amp;quot; Amit Bendov, Gong&amp;#x27;s co-founder and chief executive, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;Humans are making the decision, but they&amp;#x27;re largely assisted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction matters. Rather than replacing human judgment, AI has become what Bendov describes as a &amp;quot;second opinion&amp;quot; — a data-driven check on the intuition and guesswork that has traditionally governed sales forecasting and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slowing growth is forcing sales teams to squeeze more from every rep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of AI&amp;#x27;s ascendance in revenue organizations is no coincidence. The study reveals a sobering reality: after rebounding in 2024, average annual revenue growth among surveyed companies decelerated to 16 percent in 2025, marking a three-percentage-point decline year over year. Sales rep quota attainment fell from 52 percent to 46 percent over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culprit, according to Gong&amp;#x27;s analysis, isn&amp;#x27;t that salespeople are performing worse on individual deals. Win rates and deal duration remained consistent. The problem is that representatives are working fewer opportunities—a finding that suggests operational inefficiencies are eating into selling time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why productivity has rocketed to the top of executive priorities. For the first time in the study&amp;#x27;s history, increasing the productivity of existing teams ranked as the number-one growth strategy for 2026, jumping from fourth place the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The focus is on increasing sales productivity,&amp;quot; Bendov said. &amp;quot;How much dollar-output per dollar-input.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers back up the urgency. Teams where sellers regularly use AI tools generate 77 percent more revenue per representative than those that don&amp;#x27;t — a gap Gong characterizes as a six-figure difference per salesperson annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Companies are moving beyond basic AI automation toward strategic decision-making&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nature of AI adoption in sales has evolved considerably over the past year. In 2024, most revenue teams used AI for basic automation: transcribing calls, drafting emails, updating CRM records. Those use cases continue to grow, but 2025 marked what the report calls a shift &amp;quot;from automation to intelligence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of U.S. companies using AI for forecasting and measuring strategic initiatives jumped 50 percent year over year. These more sophisticated applications — predicting deal outcomes, identifying at-risk accounts, measuring which value propositions resonate with different buyer personas — correlate with dramatically better results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations in the 95th percentile of commercial impact from AI were two to four times more likely to have deployed these strategic use cases, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bendov offered a concrete example of how this plays out in practice. &amp;quot;Companies have thousands of deals that they roll up into their forecast,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It used to be based solely on human sentiment—believe it or not. That&amp;#x27;s why a lot of companies miss their numbers: because people say, &amp;#x27;Oh, he told me he&amp;#x27;ll buy,&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;I think I can probably get this one.&amp;#x27;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI changes that calculus by examining evidence rather than optimism. &amp;quot;Companies now get a second opinion from AI on their forecasting, and that improves forecasting accuracy dramatically — 10 [or] 15 percent better accuracy just because it&amp;#x27;s evidence-based, not just based on human sentiment,&amp;quot; Bendov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revenue-specific AI tools are dramatically outperforming general-purpose alternatives&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the study&amp;#x27;s more provocative findings concerns the type of AI that delivers results. Teams using revenue-specific AI solutions — tools built explicitly for sales workflows rather than general-purpose platforms like ChatGPT — reported 13 percent higher revenue growth and 85 percent greater commercial impact than those relying on generic tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These specialized systems were also twice as likely to be deployed for forecasting and predictive modeling, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding carries obvious implications for Gong, which sells precisely this type of domain-specific platform.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For 2025, the winning iPhone app was visual planner Tiimo, and the iPhone game of the year was the card game Pokémon TCG Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Apple has continued to avoid naming a dedicated AI app or AI chatbot as its app of the year, AI was showcased among this year’s winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple’s app of the year, Tiimo, for instance, is described as a visual AI planner that turns to-dos into plans with visual timelines. The app uses AI to break down your tasks into a realistic schedule by estimating how long each step of a task could take and helping you to create a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3072726" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Apple-App-Store-Awards-2025-winner-iPhone-App-of-the-Year-Tiimo-Al-Planner-To-do.png?w=486" width="486" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Tiimo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, the iPad app of the year, Detail, simplifies video editing with an “Auto Edit” AI feature that handles things like silence removal, zoom cuts, and adding titles and captions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3072727" height="490" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Detail-AutoEdit-Frame.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Cultural Impact winner, StoryGraph, uses a machine learning AI to make book recommendations based on your reading data, while another, Be My Eyes, offers an AI assistant that provides visual descriptions of real-world images for blind and low-vision users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3072729" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BeMyEyes-Be-My-AI-Description.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Be My Eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And the Apple Watch app of the year, Strava, includes an AI assistant that turns workout data into insights.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced winners for the iPad, Mac, Vision Pro, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and a standout within its own game subscription service, Apple Arcade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, Apple gave a handful of apps a “Cultural Impact” award. These apps, the company said, offered helpful tools, promoted understanding, or shaped a more inclusive world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple first named 45 apps and games as finalists for its awards in November, and the list has now been narrowed down to 17 apps and games. The winners include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Apple on Thursday shared its annual list of App Store Award winners, continuing its tradition of celebrating the best apps and games of the past year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For 2025, the winning iPhone app was visual planner Tiimo, and the iPhone game of the year was the card game Pokémon TCG Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Apple has continued to avoid naming a dedicated AI app or AI chatbot as its app of the year, AI was showcased among this year’s winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple’s app of the year, Tiimo, for instance, is described as a visual AI planner that turns to-dos into plans with visual timelines. The app uses AI to break down your tasks into a realistic schedule by estimating how long each step of a task could take and helping you to create a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3072726" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Apple-App-Store-Awards-2025-winner-iPhone-App-of-the-Year-Tiimo-Al-Planner-To-do.png?w=486" width="486" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Tiimo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, the iPad app of the year, Detail, simplifies video editing with an “Auto Edit” AI feature that handles things like silence removal, zoom cuts, and adding titles and captions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3072727" height="490" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Detail-AutoEdit-Frame.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Cultural Impact winner, StoryGraph, uses a machine learning AI to make book recommendations based on your reading data, while another, Be My Eyes, offers an AI assistant that provides visual descriptions of real-world images for blind and low-vision users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3072729" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BeMyEyes-Be-My-AI-Description.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Be My Eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And the Apple Watch app of the year, Strava, includes an AI assistant that turns workout data into insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced winners for the iPad, Mac, Vision Pro, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and a standout within its own game subscription service, Apple Arcade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, Apple gave a handful of apps a “Cultural Impact” award. These apps, the company said, offered helpful tools, promoted understanding, or shaped a more inclusive world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple first named 45 apps and games as finalists for its awards in November, and the list has now been narrowed down to 17 apps and games. The winners include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GeForce NOW is decking the digital halls with 30 new games to keep spirits high all month long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the fun with &lt;i&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/i&gt;, the&lt;i&gt; LEGO Harry Potter Collection&lt;/i&gt; and a sleighful of new adventures streaming straight from the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Half-Price Holiday” sale keeps the savings rolling after Black Friday, with premium GeForce NOW memberships available at 50% off for the first month for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And GeForce NOW is bringing members a new way to jump into the worlds of some of the most iconic games. Stream select Activision titles through Ubisoft+ Premium in the cloud for GeForce RTX power&amp;nbsp; — including &lt;i&gt;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Spyro Reignited Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;, with more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not all: Battle.net single sign-on is now live, making it easier than ever for members to leap into &lt;i&gt;Overwatch 2, Diablo IV&lt;/i&gt; and other titles without multiple logins. Link once and play instantly, no matter the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, the GeForce NOW Community Video Contest is rolling on — creators are decking the halls with epic clips and their merriest cloud gaming moments from all over the world. There’s still time to jump in with a clip of a favorite game or a memorable match. Submit a clip and score two Ultimate day passes — one to share with a friend and one to keep — plus a chance to win a one-year Ultimate membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Half-Price Holiday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holiday season continues with more ways to play. Even after Black Friday, GeForce NOW is keeping the celebration going with its “Half-Price Holiday” offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a limited time, premium memberships are half off for the first month. Performance and Ultimate tiers unlock shorter queue times, longer gaming sessions and access to more than 2,000 additional Install-to-Play titles powered by GeForce RTX in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Half-Price Holiday” sale is the perfect opportunity to experience premium gaming at a fraction of the cost and keep the winter gaming streak alive. The sale wraps up on Tuesday, Dec. 30, while supplies last, so now’s the time to lock in that first month at half off and head into the new year with the GeForce NOW premium experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Auto Sign-In, Auto Win&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_88067"&gt;&lt;img alt="Battle.net SSO on GFN" class="size-full wp-image-88067" height="724" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GFN_Thursday-Battlenet_-SSO.png" width="1191" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-88067"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One login, endless worlds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GeForce NOW is making it easier than ever for members to jump into games from Blizzard Entertainment, Activision and more. Starting today, members can link their Battle.net accounts directly to GeForce NOW for automatic single sign-on across all supported devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick one-time setup, members are automatically logged in for future cloud gaming sessions — no extra steps, no password juggling, just instant access to Battle.net favorites like &lt;i&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update expands on existing automatic login support for Xbox, Epic Games and Ubisoft, further streamlining the GeForce NOW cloud gaming experience. Whether at home or on the go, members can enjoy faster, simpler, smoother access to the games they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Very GeForce NOW December&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_88070"&gt;&lt;img alt="Octopath Traveler 0 on GFN" class="size-large wp-image-88070" height="840" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GFN_Thursday-Octopath_Travelers_0-1680x840.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-88070"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eight travelers, one very GeForce NOW cloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Square Enix’s &lt;i&gt;Octopath Traveler 0&lt;/i&gt; brings the series’ signature wanderlust and quiet drama back to Orsterra, this time with a fresh cast and a few extra tricks up each traveler’s sleeve. The prequel leans into sharp character banter, devious Path Actions and choices that can charm, swindle or strong-arm just about anyone in the way. Expect rich pixel art, big feelings and plenty of scheming as players embark on an adventure of their own creation, navigating revenge and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

Premium members can continue to play these games as part of their Install-to-Play benefits. See this article for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most popular Install-to-Play games — including &lt;i&gt;Megabonk, R.E.P.O &lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;i&gt;RV There Yet? &lt;/i&gt;— have moved to Ready-to-Play, so they’ll always be kept up to date for instant streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_88067"&gt;&lt;img alt="Battle.net SSO on GFN" class="size-full wp-image-88067" height="724" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GFN_Thursday-Battlenet_-SSO.png" width="1191" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-88067"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One login, endless worlds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GeForce NOW is making it easier than ever for members to jump into games from Blizzard Entertainment, Activision and more. Starting today, members can link their Battle.net accounts directly to GeForce NOW for automatic single sign-on across all supported devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick one-time setup, members are automatically logged in for future cloud gaming sessions — no extra steps, no password juggling, just instant access to Battle.net favorites like &lt;i&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update expands on existing automatic login support for Xbox, Epic Games and Ubisoft, further streamlining the GeForce NOW cloud gaming experience. Whether at home or on the go, members can enjoy faster, simpler, smoother access to the games they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Very GeForce NOW December&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_88070"&gt;&lt;img alt="Octopath Traveler 0 on GFN" class="size-large wp-image-88070" height="840" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GFN_Thursday-Octopath_Travelers_0-1680x840.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-88070"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eight travelers, one very GeForce NOW cloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Square Enix’s &lt;i&gt;Octopath Traveler 0&lt;/i&gt; brings the series’ signature wanderlust and quiet drama back to Orsterra, this time with a fresh cast and a few extra tricks up each traveler’s sleeve. The prequel leans into sharp character banter, devious Path Actions and choices that can charm, swindle or strong-arm just about anyone in the way. Expect rich pixel art, big feelings and plenty of scheming as players embark on an adventure of their own creation, navigating revenge and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

The capability marks a departure from how most AI coding tools work today. Typically, these tools load every possible capability into memory upfront — a process that burns through computational resources and can overwhelm the AI with irrelevant information. Kiro powers takes the opposite approach, activating specialized knowledge only at the moment a developer actually needs it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our goal is to give the agent specialized context so it can reach the right outcome faster — and in a way that also reduces cost,&amp;quot; said Deepak Singh, Vice President of Developer Agents and Experiences at Amazon, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch includes partnerships with nine technology companies: &lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/"&gt;Datadog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/"&gt;Dynatrace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.figma.com/"&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://neon.com/"&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com/"&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.postman.com/"&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://supabase.com/"&gt;Supabase&lt;/a&gt;, and AWS&amp;#x27;s own services. Developers can also create and share their own powers with the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why AI coding assistants choke when developers connect too many tools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why &lt;a href="https://kiro.dev/"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; powers matters, it helps to understand a growing tension in the AI development tool market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern AI coding assistants rely on something called the &lt;a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro"&gt;Model Context Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, or MCP, to connect with external tools and services. When a developer wants their AI assistant to work with Stripe for payments, Figma for design, and Supabase for databases, they connect MCP servers for each service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem: each connection loads dozens of tool definitions into the AI&amp;#x27;s working memory before it writes a single line of code. According to AWS documentation, connecting just five MCP servers can consume more than 50,000 tokens — roughly 40 percent of an AI model&amp;#x27;s context window — before the developer even types their first request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers have grown increasingly vocal about this issue. Many complain that they don&amp;#x27;t want to burn through their token allocations just to have an AI agent figure out which tools are relevant to a specific task. They want to get to their workflow instantly — not watch an overloaded agent struggle to sort through irrelevant context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, which some in the industry call &amp;quot;context rot,&amp;quot; leads to slower responses, lower-quality outputs, and significantly higher costs — since AI services typically charge by the token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inside the technology that loads AI expertise on demand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiro powers addresses this by packaging three components into a single, dynamically-loaded bundle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first component is a steering file called POWER.md, which functions as an onboarding manual for the AI agent. It tells the agent what tools are available and, crucially, when to use them. The second component is the MCP server configuration itself — the actual connection to external services. The third includes optional hooks and automation that trigger specific actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a developer mentions &amp;quot;payment&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;checkout&amp;quot; in their conversation with Kiro, the system automatically activates the Stripe power, loading its tools and best practices into context. When the developer shifts to database work, Supabase activates while Stripe deactivates. The baseline context usage when no powers are active approaches zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You click a button and it automatically loads,&amp;quot; Singh said. &amp;quot;Once a power has been created, developers just select &amp;#x27;open in Kiro&amp;#x27; and it launches the IDE with everything ready to go.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How AWS is bringing elite developer techniques to the masses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh framed Kiro powers as a democratization of advanced development practices. Before this capability, only the most sophisticated developers knew how to properly configure their AI agents with specialized context — writing custom steering files, crafting precise prompts, and manually managing which tools were active at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;ve found that our developers were adding in capabilities to make their agents more specialized,&amp;quot; Singh said. &amp;quot;They wanted to give the agent some special powers to do a specific problem. For example, they wanted their front end developer, and they wanted the agent to become an expert at backend as a service.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This observation led to a key insight: if Supabase or Stripe could build the optimal context configuration once, every developer using those services could benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kiro powers formalizes that — things that people, only the most advanced people were doing — and allows anyone to get those kind of skills,&amp;quot; Singh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why dynamic loading beats fine-tuning for most AI coding use cases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement also positions Kiro powers as a more economical alternative to fine-tuning, the process of training an AI model on specialized data to improve its performance in specific domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s much cheaper,&amp;quot; Singh said, when asked how powers compare to fine-tuning. &amp;quot;Fine-tuning is very expensive, and you can&amp;#x27;t fine-tune most frontier models.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a significant point. The most capable AI models from &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/"&gt;Anthropic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are typically &amp;quot;closed source,&amp;quot; meaning developers cannot modify their underlying training. They can only influence the models&amp;#x27; behavior through the prompts and context they provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Most people are already using powerful models like Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.5,&amp;quot; Singh said. &amp;quot;What those models need is to be pointed in the right direction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dynamic loading mechanism also reduces ongoing costs. Because powers only activate when relevant, developers aren&amp;#x27;t paying for token usage on tools they&amp;#x27;re not currently using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where Kiro powers fits in Amazon&amp;#x27;s bigger bet on autonomous AI agents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiro powers arrives as part of a broader push by AWS into what the company calls &amp;quot;agentic AI&amp;quot; — artificial intelligence systems that can operate autonomously over extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier at re:Invent, AWS announced three &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/amazons-new-ai-can-code-for-days-without-human-help-what-does-that-mean-for"&gt;frontier agents&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; designed to work for hours or days without human intervention: the Kiro autonomous agent for software development, the AWS security agent, and the AWS DevOps agent. These represent a different approach from Kiro powers — tackling large, ambiguous problems rather than providing specialized expertise for specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two approaches are complementary. Frontier agents handle complex, multi-day projects that require autonomous decision-making across multiple codebases. Kiro powers, by contrast, gives developers precise, efficient tools for everyday development tasks where speed and token efficiency matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is betting that developers need both ends of this spectrum to be productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Kiro powers reveals about the future of AI-assisted software development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch reflects a maturing market for AI development tools. GitHub Copilot, which Microsoft launched in 2021, introduced millions of developers to AI-assisted coding. Since then, a proliferation of tools — including &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/"&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cline.bot/"&gt;Cline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code"&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt; — have competed for developers&amp;#x27; attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as these tools have grown more capable, they&amp;#x27;ve also grown more complex. The &lt;a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro"&gt;Model Context Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which Anthropic open-sourced last year, created a standard for connecting AI agents to external services. That solved one problem while creating another: the context overload that Kiro powers now addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS is positioning itself as the company that understands production software development at scale. Singh emphasized that Amazon&amp;#x27;s experience running AWS for 20 years, combined with its own massive internal software engineering organization, gives it unique insight into how developers actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s not something you would use just for your prototype or your toy application,&amp;quot; Singh said of AWS&amp;#x27;s AI development tools. &amp;quot;If you want to build production applications, there&amp;#x27;s a lot of knowledge that we bring in as AWS that applies here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The road ahead for Kiro powers and cross-platform compatibility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS indicated that Kiro powers currently works only within the &lt;a href="https://kiro.dev/"&gt;Kiro IDE&lt;/a&gt;, but the company is building toward cross-compatibility with other AI development tools, including command-line interfaces, &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/"&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cline.bot/"&gt;Cline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code"&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt;. The company&amp;#x27;s documentation describes a future where developers can &amp;quot;build a power once, use it anywhere&amp;quot; — though that vision remains aspirational for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the technology partners launching powers today, the appeal is straightforward: rather than maintaining separate integration documentation for every AI tool on the market, they can create a single power that works everywhere Kiro does. As more AI coding assistants crowd into the market, that kind of efficiency becomes increasingly valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiro powers is &lt;a href="https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-powers/"&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt; to developers using Kiro IDE version 0.7 or later at no additional charge beyond the standard Kiro subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underlying bet is a familiar one in the history of computing: that the winners in AI-assisted development won&amp;#x27;t be the tools that try to do everything at once, but the ones smart enough to know what to forget.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday introduced &lt;a href="https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-powers/"&gt;Kiro powers&lt;/a&gt;, a system that allows software developers to give their AI coding assistants instant, specialized expertise in specific tools and workflows — addressing what the company calls a fundamental bottleneck in how artificial intelligence agents operate today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS made the announcement at its annual &lt;a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/"&gt;re:Invent conference&lt;/a&gt; in Las Vegas.

The baseline context usage when no powers are active approaches zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You click a button and it automatically loads,&amp;quot; Singh said. &amp;quot;Once a power has been created, developers just select &amp;#x27;open in Kiro&amp;#x27; and it launches the IDE with everything ready to go.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How AWS is bringing elite developer techniques to the masses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh framed Kiro powers as a democratization of advanced development practices. Before this capability, only the most sophisticated developers knew how to properly configure their AI agents with specialized context — writing custom steering files, crafting precise prompts, and manually managing which tools were active at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;ve found that our developers were adding in capabilities to make their agents more specialized,&amp;quot; Singh said. &amp;quot;They wanted to give the agent some special powers to do a specific problem. For example, they wanted their front end developer, and they wanted the agent to become an expert at backend as a service.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This observation led to a key insight: if Supabase or Stripe could build the optimal context configuration once, every developer using those services could benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kiro powers formalizes that — things that people, only the most advanced people were doing — and allows anyone to get those kind of skills,&amp;quot; Singh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why dynamic loading beats fine-tuning for most AI coding use cases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement also positions Kiro powers as a more economical alternative to fine-tuning, the process of training an AI model on specialized data to improve its performance in specific domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s much cheaper,&amp;quot; Singh said, when asked how powers compare to fine-tuning. &amp;quot;Fine-tuning is very expensive, and you can&amp;#x27;t fine-tune most frontier models.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a significant point. The most capable AI models from &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/"&gt;Anthropic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are typically &amp;quot;closed source,&amp;quot; meaning developers cannot modify their underlying training. They can only influence the models&amp;#x27; behavior through the prompts and context they provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Most people are already using powerful models like Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.5,&amp;quot; Singh said. &amp;quot;What those models need is to be pointed in the right direction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dynamic loading mechanism also reduces ongoing costs. Because powers only activate when relevant, developers aren&amp;#x27;t paying for token usage on tools they&amp;#x27;re not currently using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where Kiro powers fits in Amazon&amp;#x27;s bigger bet on autonomous AI agents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiro powers arrives as part of a broader push by AWS into what the company calls &amp;quot;agentic AI&amp;quot; — artificial intelligence systems that can operate autonomously over extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier at re:Invent, AWS announced three &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/amazons-new-ai-can-code-for-days-without-human-help-what-does-that-mean-for"&gt;frontier agents&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; designed to work for hours or days without human intervention: the Kiro autonomous agent for software development, the AWS security agent, and the AWS DevOps agent. These represent a different approach from Kiro powers — tackling large, ambiguous problems rather than providing specialized expertise for specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two approaches are complementary. Frontier agents handle complex, multi-day projects that require autonomous decision-making across multiple codebases. Kiro powers, by contrast, gives developers precise, efficient tools for everyday development tasks where speed and token efficiency matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is betting that developers need both ends of this spectrum to be productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Kiro powers reveals about the future of AI-assisted software development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch reflects a maturing market for AI development tools. GitHub Copilot, which Microsoft launched in 2021, introduced millions of developers to AI-assisted coding. Since then, a proliferation of tools — including &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/"&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cline.bot/"&gt;Cline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code"&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt; — have competed for developers&amp;#x27; attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as these tools have grown more capable, they&amp;#x27;ve also grown more complex. The &lt;a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro"&gt;Model Context Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which Anthropic open-sourced last year, created a standard for connecting AI agents to external services. That solved one problem while creating another: the context overload that Kiro powers now addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS is positioning itself as the company that understands production software development at scale. Singh emphasized that Amazon&amp;#x27;s experience running AWS for 20 years, combined with its own massive internal software engineering organization, gives it unique insight into how developers actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s not something you would use just for your prototype or your toy application,&amp;quot; Singh said of AWS&amp;#x27;s AI development tools. &amp;quot;If you want to build production applications, there&amp;#x27;s a lot of knowledge that we bring in as AWS that applies here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The road ahead for Kiro powers and cross-platform compatibility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS indicated that Kiro powers currently works only within the &lt;a href="https://kiro.dev/"&gt;Kiro IDE&lt;/a&gt;, but the company is building toward cross-compatibility with other AI development tools, including command-line interfaces, &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/"&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cline.bot/"&gt;Cline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code"&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt;. The company&amp;#x27;s documentation describes a future where developers can &amp;quot;build a power once, use it anywhere&amp;quot; — though that vision remains aspirational for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the technology partners launching powers today, the appeal is straightforward: rather than maintaining separate integration documentation for every AI tool on the market, they can create a single power that works everywhere Kiro does. As more AI coding assistants crowd into the market, that kind of efficiency becomes increasingly valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiro powers is &lt;a href="https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-powers/"&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt; to developers using Kiro IDE version 0.7 or later at no additional charge beyond the standard Kiro subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underlying bet is a familiar one in the history of computing: that the winners in AI-assisted development won&amp;#x27;t be the tools that try to do everything at once, but the ones smart enough to know what to forget.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/aws-launches-kiro-powers-with-stripe-figma-and-datadog-integrations-for-ai</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 14:02:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] EU investigating Meta over policy change that bans rival AI chatbots from WhatsApp (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/eu-investigating-meta-over-policy-change-that-bans-rival-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/whatsapp-logo.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta’s decision to serve only its AI chatbot, Meta AI, to WhatsApp users isn’t sitting well with the competition regulators in Europe. The European Commission on Thursday said it is launching an antitrust investigation into Meta’s move to ban other AI companies from using WhatsApp’s business tools to offer their own AI chatbots to users on the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;WhatsApp in October changed its business API policy to ban general-purpose chatbots from the chat app, saying that the API isn’t designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT are prohibited from being distributed via the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its statement, the EU’s executive arm said it was concerned that the policy may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As a result of the new policy, competing AI providers may be blocked from reaching their customers through WhatsApp. On the other hand, Meta’s own AI service ‘Meta AI’ would remain accessible to users on the platform,” the Commission wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI markets are booming in Europe and beyond. We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully from this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is why we are investigating if Meta’s new policy might be illegal under competition rules, and whether we should act quickly to prevent any possible irreparable harm to competition in the AI space,” Ribera said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Meta is found guilty of breaching EU’s antitrust rules, it may be fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue, and the Commission may impose additional measures on the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;WhatsApp, for its part, called the EU’s claims “baseless,” and said people have many other options to use rival AI companies’ chatbots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API puts a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support,” a spokesperson for WhatsApp said in an emailed statement. “Even still, the AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations, and operating systems.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/whatsapp-logo.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta’s decision to serve only its AI chatbot, Meta AI, to WhatsApp users isn’t sitting well with the competition regulators in Europe.

The company on Wednesday said it is expanding its partnership with cloud data company Snowflake in a $200 million multi-year AI deal that will bring Anthropic’s large language models to Snowflake’s platform and, consequently, to its sizable customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide,” Snowflake’s co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in the blog post. “Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This deal is also being positioned as a joint go-to-market initiative to bring AI agents to enterprise customers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 will power Snowflake Intelligence, the cloud company’s enterprise AI service. Snowflake said its customers will be able to tap Claude models, including Claude Opus 4.5, to run multimodal data analysis. Customers will also be able to use the models to build their own custom agents. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise,”&amp;nbsp;Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said in a statement. “This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It’s a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic has struck a slew of large enterprise deals in recent months as it seeks to prioritize selling to businesses instead of individual users — a strategy in contrast to its arch-rival OpenAI, which has taken a more popular route to growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic in October signed a deal with Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the consulting giant’s employee base of more than 500,000 staff. That same week, Anthropic struck a partnership with IBM to bring some of its LLMs into the latter’s software products. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super Serves as Brain of Self-Paddling Canoe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robotics enthusiast Dave Niewinski has built a self‑paddling canoe using the Jetson Orin Nano Super Developer Kit, letting boaters relax and glide on their rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotic boat integrates two six-axis robotic arms mounted on a lightweight canoe frame, with paddle motion controlled through ROS software and AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jetson Orin Nano Super delivers up to 67 INT8 TOPS of AI performance through its NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU, 32 Tensor Cores and 1,024 CUDA cores, alongside a six-core Arm Cortex‑A78AE CPU and 8GB LPDDR5 memory with 102 GB/s bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its low power envelope of up to 25 watts enables sustained real-time inference and control in mobile, battery-powered applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;NVIDIA AGX Orin Dives Into Open Seas on Underwater AI System&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OptoScale, an AI aquaculture company based in Norway, has integrated the Jetson AGX Orin-powered MX13/23 platform from edge AI solutions provider Aetina to build an underwater AI sensing system that monitors fish health in massive open-sea pens housing thousands of fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-88085" height="442" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/optoscale-960x442.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mounted inside a submerged camera module, the Jetson AGX Orin processes high-resolution video streams directly at the edge and runs real-time vision models on the device. This allows the system to estimate biomass with exceptional accuracy and deliver continuous inference-based insights even in remote environments with limited connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether tapping into the breakthrough capabilities of Jetson AGX Thor, the versatility of Jetson AGX Orin or the palm-sized power of the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super Developer Kit, anyone can deck out their bots with greater physical AI performance for lower costs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jetson AGX Thor Developer Kit — now 20% off — is designed for building humanoid robots, fleets of autonomous machines and multimodal physical AI agents. It delivers server-class compute and generative AI capabilities for the most challenging workloads in labs, factories and the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jetson AGX Orin Developer Kit — now 50% off — powers advanced robots, autonomous machines and generative AI at the edge with 275 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of AI performance, ideal for delivery bots, smart vision capabilities and industrial automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jetson Orin Nano Super Developer Kit — the world’s most affordable generative AI supercomputer — offers desktop-class AI in a palm-sized kit for exploring, building and deploying cutting-edge generative AI, vision and robotics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more below on how the NVIDIA Jetson platform presents the future of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super Serves as Brain of Self-Paddling Canoe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robotics enthusiast Dave Niewinski has built a self‑paddling canoe using the Jetson Orin Nano Super Developer Kit, letting boaters relax and glide on their rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotic boat integrates two six-axis robotic arms mounted on a lightweight canoe frame, with paddle motion controlled through ROS software and AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jetson Orin Nano Super delivers up to 67 INT8 TOPS of AI performance through its NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU, 32 Tensor Cores and 1,024 CUDA cores, alongside a six-core Arm Cortex‑A78AE CPU and 8GB LPDDR5 memory with 102 GB/s bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its low power envelope of up to 25 watts enables sustained real-time inference and control in mobile, battery-powered applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;NVIDIA AGX Orin Dives Into Open Seas on Underwater AI System&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OptoScale, an AI aquaculture company based in Norway, has integrated the Jetson AGX Orin-powered MX13/23 platform from edge AI solutions provider Aetina to build an underwater AI sensing system that monitors fish health in massive open-sea pens housing thousands of fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-88085" height="442" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/optoscale-960x442.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mounted inside a submerged camera module, the Jetson AGX Orin processes high-resolution video streams directly at the edge and runs real-time vision models on the device. This allows the system to estimate biomass with exceptional accuracy and deliver continuous inference-based insights even in remote environments with limited connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jetson AGX Orin delivers powerful GPU acceleration and high TOPS AI performance in a compact, energy-efficient module ideal for deployment anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor Powers Mobile Humanoid ‘Dex’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas-based Richtech Robotics is developing Dex, a mobile humanoid robot for factory and warehouse environments designed to handle light-to medium-weight industrial tasks like machine operation, parts sorting, material handling and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor, Dex combines the mobility of an autonomous wheeled platform with the precision of dual-arm dexterity, allowing it to efficiently navigate environments and pick and place objects. It was trained with a mix of real-world and synthetic data generated from NVIDIA Isaac Sim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Jetson Thor modules enable real-time reasoning for physical AI, delivering up to 2,070 FP4 teraflops of AI compute and 128GB of memory with power configurable between 40-130 watts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With discounted pricing for a limited time and a full spectrum of performance options, the NVIDIA Jetson family gives anyone the tools to design, build and deploy the next generation of intelligent machines. It’s the ideal gift for robot lovers — and the robots in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Company executives are mulling slashing the virtual reality platform’s budget by up to 30%, the report said, adding that any reductions would also include layoffs. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Meta does go ahead with such a plan, the move would reflect the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware — both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since Meta’s rebrand in 2021, investors have been skeptical of the company’s allocation of resources to Metaverse projects, which lose billions of dollars each quarter. The company’s efforts in AI and smart glasses have been more successful, though investors still worry that its investment plans are too steep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta’s shares rose, however, following this report.&lt;/p&gt;

As global temperatures rise, that choreography can falter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkley Walker, an associate professor at Michigan State University, spends his days thinking about how to keep that choreography in step.

Because the structure of GLYK has never been determined experimentally, they turned to AlphaFold to predict its 3D shape, not only in plants but also in a heat-loving algae that thrives in volcanic hot springs. By taking AlphaFold’s predicted shapes and plugging them into sophisticated molecular simulations, the researchers could watch as these enzymes flexed and twisted as the temperature rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when the problem came into focus: three flexible loops in the plant version of GLYK wobbled out of shape at high heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiments alone could never deliver such insights, says Walker: “AlphaFold enabled access to experimentally unavailable enzyme structures and helped us identify key sections for modification.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with this knowledge, the researchers in Walker’s lab made a series of hybrid enzymes that replaced the unstable loops in the plant GLYK with more rigid ones borrowed from the algae’s GLYK.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature is rolling out now to global users on Facebook and Instagram on both the iOS and Android apps. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new AI assistant being tested is designed to offer more personalized help with things like account recovery, managing your profile, or updating your settings. This particular feature will first be available to Facebook users, but the company expects to roll it out to other apps in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3072778" height="592" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/01_Support-Hub_Carousel-02.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company claims that its use of AI systems is helping protect users’ accounts, noting that account hacks have decreased by over 30% globally across Facebook and Instagram. AI is also used to help identify and stop other threats, like phishing, suspicious logins, compromised accounts, and more.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, Meta says that AI has helped it avoid disabling accounts by mistake more than ever before and has sped up the appeals process when mistakes occurred. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3072781" height="592" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-03.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, that claim doesn’t match up with the lived experience of thousands of users of Meta’s apps, who complain that they’ve lost access to their accounts or Facebook Pages due to mistakes made by Meta’s systems. Some even suspect that AI is to blame, as the mistakes and support requests don’t seem to involve any human oversight. A portion of these users are threatening or engaged in legal action, particularly when losing their accounts has real-world impacts on their businesses or livelihoods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The situation has now gotten so bad that an entire Reddit forum was set up this year to help people who are suing Meta over their disabled accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta believes the new hub could address these kinds of problems, saying that it will centralize account recovery options and offer a more streamlined account recovery experience with clearer guidelines and simpler verification. Plus, the system sends out improved SMS and email alerts about risky activity and will recognize users’ devices better than before, Meta promises. And it will connect users with other tools to secure their account, like running a security checkup, setting up two-factor authentication, or adding a passkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3072780" height="592" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Account recovery methods now also offer the option to take&amp;nbsp;an optional selfie video&amp;nbsp;to verify your identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Meta claims the new hub will make things easier on its users, simply the act of moving around where settings and help are found can lead to confusion. Over the years, Meta has regularly relocated key areas like its account settings, data management tools, and privacy features, ostensibly to make things easier for users. But the constant changes also mean that users can’t remember where to find things in the app, as they’re often not where they were found before, and various menus and navigation have changed. &lt;/p&gt;
