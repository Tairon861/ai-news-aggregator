&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But it’s been more than a decade since Pope’s last major comics work, and in a Zoom interview with TechCrunch, he admitted that the intervening years have had their frustrations. At one point, he held up a large stack of drawings and said the public hasn’t seen any of it yet.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Making graphic novels is not like making comics,” Pope said. “You’re basically writing a novel, it can take years, and you work with a contract. No one can see the work, so it can be very frustrating.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Thankfully, the drought is ending. A career-spanning exhibition of Pope’s work just opened at the Philippe Labaune Gallery in New York. An expanded edition of his art book, now titled “PulpHope2: The Art of Paul Pope,” was published in March. And the first volume in a collection of Pope’s self-published science fiction epic “THB” is due in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s all part of what Pope described as “a number of chess moves” designed to “reintroduce” and — he grudgingly admitted — “rebrand” himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pope is reemerging at a fraught time for the comics industry and creativity in general, with publishers and writers suing AI companies while generative AI tools go viral by copying popular artists. He even said that it’s “completely conceivable” that comic book artists could soon be replaced by AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The contrast is particularly stark in Pope’s case, since he’s known for largely eschewing digital tools in favor of brushes and ink. But he said he isn’t ruling out taking advantage of AI, which he already uses for research.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m less concerned about having some random person create some image based on one of my drawings, than I am about killer robots and surveillance and drones,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="PulpHope cover" class="wp-image-3020888" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pulphope-cover.jpg?w=554" width="554" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Paul Pope/Archaia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a gallery show coming up, and it coincides with the second volume of your art book, “PulpHope.” How did those come about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I got contacted by Boom Studios, I think it was late 2023, and they were interested in possibly collaborating on something [through their boutique imprint Archaia]. So we went back and forth for a bit, I came on as art director, and I was able to hire my own designer, this guy Steve Alexander, also known as Rinzen, and we spent about nine months [in] 2024 putting the book together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And then, coincidentally, I know Philippe Labaune, just from having been to the gallery, we have mutual friends and things, and he made the offer to show work from not only the book, [but] kind of a career retrospective. It’s ballooned into something really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you somebody who thinks about the arc of their career and how it fits together, or are you mostly future-oriented?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I’d say a combination of both, because — I have said this elsewhere, but I think at a certain point, an artist needs to become their own curator. Jack Kirby famously said, “All that matters is the 10% of your best work. The rest of it gets you to the 10%.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But then in my case, I do a lot of variant covers. I’ve worked on many things outside of comics that are kind of hard to acquire, whether it’s screen prints or fashion industry stuff. And I thought it’d be really cool if we do something that’s a chronological look at the life of an artist — [something that] focuses mainly on comics, [with] a lot of stuff that people have either never seen or it’s hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s the first of a number of chess moves that I’ve been setting up for a long time. And the gallery is — I would call it a second chess move. I have another announcement later in the summer for a new project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Making graphic novels is not like making comics. You’re basically writing a novel, it can take years, and you work with a contract. No one can see the work, so it can be very frustrating. This stack here, this is my current work, and it’s all stuff that basically hasn’t been published yet. So I thought this was a great way to either reintroduce my work or — I hate the term “rebrand,” but rebrand myself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your essay “Weapons of Choice,” you talk about all these different tools you use, the brushes and pens, the Sumi ink. Has your working style been pretty consistent, pretty analog, for your entire career?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I would say mostly. I did start incorporating Photoshop for coloring and textures, kind of late to the game — I’d say it was not ‘till around 2003 or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I developed carpal tunnel around 2010, so I’ve tried to steer away from digital as much as I can, but I still use it. I mean, I use Photoshop every day. It’s just [that] most of what I do is the comics purism of ink on a paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3020887" height="459" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/paul-pope-studio.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Paul Pope/Archaia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think of ink on paper as objectively better, or it just happens to be how you work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I don’t think it’s better, to be honest. I think any tool that works is good. You know, Moebius used to say that sometimes he would draw with coffee grinds, he drew with a fork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And I have some friends, in fact, a number of friends, who are doing highly popular mainstream books, who have gravitated toward digital work, or its various advantages. And I just don’t like that. But one thing [is,] I sell original art, and if you have a digital document, you might be able to make a print of it, but there is no drawing. It’s binary code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also, I feel an allegiance to the guys like Alex Toth and Steve Ditko, who took time to teach me things. Moebius, I was friends with him. Frank Miller. We all work in traditional analog art. I feel like I want to be a torchbearer for that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about the fact that comics-making is increasingly digital?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I think it’s inevitable. The genie is out of the bottle at this point. So now it’s a matter of being given a new, vivid array of tools that artists can choose from.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you talk to younger artists, do you feel like there’s still a lane for them to do analog work?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Absolutely. One of the challenges now is, you can download an app, or you can get an iPad Pro and start drawing. I think the learning curve in some ways is a little quicker, and you can fix, edit, and change things that you don’t like. But it also means the drawing never ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One thing I really like about analog art is, it’s punishing. [One] piece of advice I got early on was, your first 1,000 ink drawings with a brush are going to be terrible, and you just have to get through those first 1,000. And it was true, it was humiliating — every time I sat down and tried to draw with the brushes, a lot of the work is going to be in your fingers or your wrists, and it’s easy to make mistakes, but gradually you get an authority over the tool, and then you can draw what it is you really see in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before we started recording, we were also talking about AI, and it sounds like it’s something you’ve been aware of and thinking about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yeah, sure, I use it all the time. I don’t use it for anything creative outside of research. For example, I just wrote an essay on one of my favorite cartoonists, Attilio Micheluzzi. His library is being published by Fantagraphics right now, and I did the intro for the second book. It’s amazing, because there’s a lot of personal detail about the man that was really, really hard to find, unless you could literally go to — he died in Naples, but he spent a lot of his time in North Africa and Rome. This guy’s a man of mystery. But you now can get the dates of his birth and his death, what caused his death, what did he do? And AI helps with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or sometimes, I work on story structure. But I don’t use it directly to create anything. I use it more like, let’s say it’s a consultant. My nephew writes [code] and he describes AI as a sociopath personal assistant that doesn’t mind lying to you. I’ve asked AI at times like, “What books has Paul Pope published?” It’s kind of strange, because maybe 80% of it will be correct, and 20% will be completely hallucinated books I’ve never done. So I tend to take my nephew’s point of view on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have this skepticism, but you don’t want to rule out using it where it’s useful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No, absolutely not. It’s a tool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a very contentious point with cartoonists, and there are important questions about authorship, copyright protection. In fact, I just had dinner with Frank Miller last night, we were talking about this. If [I ask AI to] give me “Lady Godiva, naked on the horse, as drawn by Frank Miller,” I can spit that out in 30 seconds. Some people might say, “Oh, this is my art.” But AI doesn’t generate the art from the same kind of place that humans would, where it’s based on identity and personal history and emotional inflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It can recombine everything that’s been known and programmed into the database. And you could do that with my stuff, too. It never looks like my drawings, but it’s getting better and better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But I think really, speaking as a futurist, the real question is killer robots and surveillance and a lot of technology being developed very, very quickly, without a lot of public consideration about the implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here in New York, at the moment, there’s a really great gallery on 23rd Street called Poster House. It’s pretty much the history of 20th-century poster design, which is right up my alley. So I went there with my girlfriend last week, and they currently have an exhibit on the atom bomb and how it was portrayed in different contexts through poster art. There was this movement “Atoms for Peace,” where people were pro-atomic energy [but] were against war, and I kind of liked that, because that’s how I feel about AI. I would say, “AI for peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I’m less concerned about having some random person create some image based on one of my drawings, than I am about killer robots and surveillance and drones. I think that’s a much more serious question, because at some point, we’re going to pass a tipping point, because there’s a lot of bad actors in the world that are developing AI, and I don’t know if some of the developers themselves are concerned about the implications. They just want to be the first person to do it — and of course, they’re going to make a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Heavy Liquid" class="wp-image-3020890" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/heavy-liquid.jpg?w=506" width="506" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Paul Pope/Archaia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned this idea of somebody typing, “Give me a drawing in the style of Paul Pope.” And I think the argument that some people would make is that you shouldn’t be able to do that — or at least Paul should be getting paid, since your art was presumably used to train the model, and that’s your name being used.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a good question. In fact, I was asking AI before our talk today — I think the best thing is to go to the source — “compare unlicensed art usage [for] AI-generated imagery with torrenting of MP3s in the ‘90s.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And AI said that there’s definitely some similarities, because you’re using work that’s already been produced and created without compensating the artist. But in the case of AI, you can add elements to it that make it different. It’s not like [when] somebody stole Guns N’ Roses’ record, ”Chinese Democracy,” and put it online. That’s different from sitting down with an emulator for music with AI [and saying,] “I want to write a song in the style of Guns N’ Roses, and I want the guitar solo to sound like Slash.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Obviously, if somebody publishes a comic book and it looks just like one of mine, that might be a problem. There’s class action lawsuits on the behalf of some of the artists, so I think this is a legal issue that is going to be hammered out, probably. But it gets more complicated, because it’s very hard to regulate AI development or distribution in places like Afghanistan or Iran or China. They’re not going to follow American legal code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then on the killer robot side, you’ve written a lot and drawn a lot of dystopian fiction yourself, like in “Batman: Year 100.” How close do you feel we are to that future right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I think we’re probably, honestly, about two years away. I mean, robots are already being used on the battlefield. Drones are used in lethal warfare. I wouldn’t be too surprised, within two or three years, if we start seeing robot automation on a regular basis. In fact, where my girlfriend lives in Brooklyn, there’s a fully robot-serviced coffee shop, no one works there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And the scary thing is, I think people become normalized to this, so the technology is implemented before there’s the social contract, where people are able to ask whether or not this is a good [thing].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;My lawyer, for example, he thinks within two or three years, Marvel Comics will replace artists with AI. You won’t even have to pay any artists. And I think that’s completely conceivable. I think storyboarding for film can easily be replaced with AI. Animatics, which you need to do for a lot of films, can be replaced. Eventually, comic book artists can be replaced. Almost every job can be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about that? Are you worried about your own career?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I don’t worry about my career because I believe in human innovation. Call me an optimist. And the one distinct advantage we have over machine intelligence is — until we actually take the bridle off and machines are fully autonomous and have a conscience and a memory and emotional reflections, which are the things that are required in order to become an artist, or, for that matter, a human — they can’t replace what humans do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They can &lt;em&gt;replicate&lt;/em&gt; what humans do. If you’re trying to get into the business of, let’s say comics, and you’re trying to draw like Jim Lee, there’s a chance you might get replaced, because AI has already imprinted every single Jim Lee image in its memory. So that would be easy to replace, but what is harder to replace is the human invention of something like whatever Miles Davis introduced into jazz, or Picasso introduced, along with Juan Gris, when they invented Cubism. I don’t see machines being able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You were talking about the discipline needed to draw with a brush, and one of the things I worry about is, if we increasingly devalue the time and the money and everything it takes for somebody to get good at that, you can’t decouple the inventiveness of the Paul Pope who comes up with these cool stories with the Paul Pope who spent all his time making drawing after drawing with brushes and ink. If we think we can just focus on coming up with cool ideas, it’s not going to work like that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I do think about this. I think it would be very challenging to be 18, 19, having grown up with a screen in front of you, you can upload an app to do anything, within seconds, and that’s just not the way most of human history has worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I mean, I don’t think we’re at that term “singularity” yet, but we’re getting really close to it. And that’s the one thing that worries me is whether we talk about killer machines or machine consciousness overtaking human ingenuity, it would almost be a forfeit on the part of the people to stop having a sense of ethics, a sense of curiosity, determination — all these old school, bootstrap concepts that some people think are old-fashioned now, but I think that’s how we preserve our humanity and our sense of soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first big collection of your “THB” comics is coming this fall, and it sounds like that’s also a big part of the Paul Pope rebrand or relaunch, the next chess move. Is it safe to assume that one of the other next chess moves is “Battling Boy 2”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. It’s funny, because for a long time, we had it scheduled — “Battling Boy 2” has to come out before “THB” comes out. But there was some restructuring with [my publisher’s] parent company, Macmillan, and my new art director came on in 2023 and he said, “You know what, let’s just move this around. We’re going to start putting ‘THB’ out. It’s already there.” And I was so relieved because, again, “Battling Boy” is 500-plus pages, and I’d work on it, then I’d stop working to do commercial work. I work on it. I stop. I work on the movie. It’s like I’m driving this high performance car, but it doesn’t have enough gas in it, so I have to keep stopping and putting gasoline [in it]. So it’s been reinvigorating [to have a new book coming out], because it kick-started everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Paul Pope has written and drawn some of the most gorgeous comics of the twenty-first century — from “Batman: Year 100,” in which Batman challenges a dystopian surveillance state, to “Battling Boy,” with its adolescent god proving his mettle by fighting giant monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think of ink on paper as objectively better, or it just happens to be how you work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I don’t think it’s better, to be honest. I think any tool that works is good. You know, Moebius used to say that sometimes he would draw with coffee grinds, he drew with a fork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And I have some friends, in fact, a number of friends, who are doing highly popular mainstream books, who have gravitated toward digital work, or its various advantages. And I just don’t like that. But one thing [is,] I sell original art, and if you have a digital document, you might be able to make a print of it, but there is no drawing. It’s binary code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also, I feel an allegiance to the guys like Alex Toth and Steve Ditko, who took time to teach me things. Moebius, I was friends with him. Frank Miller. We all work in traditional analog art. I feel like I want to be a torchbearer for that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about the fact that comics-making is increasingly digital?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I think it’s inevitable. The genie is out of the bottle at this point. So now it’s a matter of being given a new, vivid array of tools that artists can choose from.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you talk to younger artists, do you feel like there’s still a lane for them to do analog work?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Absolutely. One of the challenges now is, you can download an app, or you can get an iPad Pro and start drawing. I think the learning curve in some ways is a little quicker, and you can fix, edit, and change things that you don’t like. But it also means the drawing never ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One thing I really like about analog art is, it’s punishing. [One] piece of advice I got early on was, your first 1,000 ink drawings with a brush are going to be terrible, and you just have to get through those first 1,000. And it was true, it was humiliating — every time I sat down and tried to draw with the brushes, a lot of the work is going to be in your fingers or your wrists, and it’s easy to make mistakes, but gradually you get an authority over the tool, and then you can draw what it is you really see in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before we started recording, we were also talking about AI, and it sounds like it’s something you’ve been aware of and thinking about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yeah, sure, I use it all the time. I don’t use it for anything creative outside of research. For example, I just wrote an essay on one of my favorite cartoonists, Attilio Micheluzzi. His library is being published by Fantagraphics right now, and I did the intro for the second book. It’s amazing, because there’s a lot of personal detail about the man that was really, really hard to find, unless you could literally go to — he died in Naples, but he spent a lot of his time in North Africa and Rome. This guy’s a man of mystery. But you now can get the dates of his birth and his death, what caused his death, what did he do? And AI helps with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or sometimes, I work on story structure. But I don’t use it directly to create anything. I use it more like, let’s say it’s a consultant. My nephew writes [code] and he describes AI as a sociopath personal assistant that doesn’t mind lying to you. I’ve asked AI at times like, “What books has Paul Pope published?” It’s kind of strange, because maybe 80% of it will be correct, and 20% will be completely hallucinated books I’ve never done. So I tend to take my nephew’s point of view on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have this skepticism, but you don’t want to rule out using it where it’s useful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No, absolutely not. It’s a tool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a very contentious point with cartoonists, and there are important questions about authorship, copyright protection. In fact, I just had dinner with Frank Miller last night, we were talking about this. If [I ask AI to] give me “Lady Godiva, naked on the horse, as drawn by Frank Miller,” I can spit that out in 30 seconds. Some people might say, “Oh, this is my art.” But AI doesn’t generate the art from the same kind of place that humans would, where it’s based on identity and personal history and emotional inflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It can recombine everything that’s been known and programmed into the database. And you could do that with my stuff, too. It never looks like my drawings, but it’s getting better and better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But I think really, speaking as a futurist, the real question is killer robots and surveillance and a lot of technology being developed very, very quickly, without a lot of public consideration about the implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here in New York, at the moment, there’s a really great gallery on 23rd Street called Poster House. It’s pretty much the history of 20th-century poster design, which is right up my alley. So I went there with my girlfriend last week, and they currently have an exhibit on the atom bomb and how it was portrayed in different contexts through poster art. There was this movement “Atoms for Peace,” where people were pro-atomic energy [but] were against war, and I kind of liked that, because that’s how I feel about AI. I would say, “AI for peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I’m less concerned about having some random person create some image based on one of my drawings, than I am about killer robots and surveillance and drones. I think that’s a much more serious question, because at some point, we’re going to pass a tipping point, because there’s a lot of bad actors in the world that are developing AI, and I don’t know if some of the developers themselves are concerned about the implications. They just want to be the first person to do it — and of course, they’re going to make a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Heavy Liquid" class="wp-image-3020890" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/heavy-liquid.jpg?w=506" width="506" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Paul Pope/Archaia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned this idea of somebody typing, “Give me a drawing in the style of Paul Pope.” And I think the argument that some people would make is that you shouldn’t be able to do that — or at least Paul should be getting paid, since your art was presumably used to train the model, and that’s your name being used.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a good question. In fact, I was asking AI before our talk today — I think the best thing is to go to the source — “compare unlicensed art usage [for] AI-generated imagery with torrenting of MP3s in the ‘90s.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And AI said that there’s definitely some similarities, because you’re using work that’s already been produced and created without compensating the artist. But in the case of AI, you can add elements to it that make it different. It’s not like [when] somebody stole Guns N’ Roses’ record, ”Chinese Democracy,” and put it online. That’s different from sitting down with an emulator for music with AI [and saying,] “I want to write a song in the style of Guns N’ Roses, and I want the guitar solo to sound like Slash.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Obviously, if somebody publishes a comic book and it looks just like one of mine, that might be a problem. There’s class action lawsuits on the behalf of some of the artists, so I think this is a legal issue that is going to be hammered out, probably. But it gets more complicated, because it’s very hard to regulate AI development or distribution in places like Afghanistan or Iran or China. They’re not going to follow American legal code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then on the killer robot side, you’ve written a lot and drawn a lot of dystopian fiction yourself, like in “Batman: Year 100.” How close do you feel we are to that future right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I think we’re probably, honestly, about two years away. I mean, robots are already being used on the battlefield. Drones are used in lethal warfare. I wouldn’t be too surprised, within two or three years, if we start seeing robot automation on a regular basis. In fact, where my girlfriend lives in Brooklyn, there’s a fully robot-serviced coffee shop, no one works there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And the scary thing is, I think people become normalized to this, so the technology is implemented before there’s the social contract, where people are able to ask whether or not this is a good [thing].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;My lawyer, for example, he thinks within two or three years, Marvel Comics will replace artists with AI. You won’t even have to pay any artists. And I think that’s completely conceivable. I think storyboarding for film can easily be replaced with AI. Animatics, which you need to do for a lot of films, can be replaced. Eventually, comic book artists can be replaced. Almost every job can be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about that? Are you worried about your own career?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I don’t worry about my career because I believe in human innovation. Call me an optimist. And the one distinct advantage we have over machine intelligence is — until we actually take the bridle off and machines are fully autonomous and have a conscience and a memory and emotional reflections, which are the things that are required in order to become an artist, or, for that matter, a human — they can’t replace what humans do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They can &lt;em&gt;replicate&lt;/em&gt; what humans do. If you’re trying to get into the business of, let’s say comics, and you’re trying to draw like Jim Lee, there’s a chance you might get replaced, because AI has already imprinted every single Jim Lee image in its memory. So that would be easy to replace, but what is harder to replace is the human invention of something like whatever Miles Davis introduced into jazz, or Picasso introduced, along with Juan Gris, when they invented Cubism. I don’t see machines being able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You were talking about the discipline needed to draw with a brush, and one of the things I worry about is, if we increasingly devalue the time and the money and everything it takes for somebody to get good at that, you can’t decouple the inventiveness of the Paul Pope who comes up with these cool stories with the Paul Pope who spent all his time making drawing after drawing with brushes and ink. If we think we can just focus on coming up with cool ideas, it’s not going to work like that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I do think about this. I think it would be very challenging to be 18, 19, having grown up with a screen in front of you, you can upload an app to do anything, within seconds, and that’s just not the way most of human history has worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I mean, I don’t think we’re at that term “singularity” yet, but we’re getting really close to it. And that’s the one thing that worries me is whether we talk about killer machines or machine consciousness overtaking human ingenuity, it would almost be a forfeit on the part of the people to stop having a sense of ethics, a sense of curiosity, determination — all these old school, bootstrap concepts that some people think are old-fashioned now, but I think that’s how we preserve our humanity and our sense of soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first big collection of your “THB” comics is coming this fall, and it sounds like that’s also a big part of the Paul Pope rebrand or relaunch, the next chess move. Is it safe to assume that one of the other next chess moves is “Battling Boy 2”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. It’s funny, because for a long time, we had it scheduled — “Battling Boy 2” has to come out before “THB” comes out. But there was some restructuring with [my publisher’s] parent company, Macmillan, and my new art director came on in 2023 and he said, “You know what, let’s just move this around. We’re going to start putting ‘THB’ out. It’s already there.” And I was so relieved because, again, “Battling Boy” is 500-plus pages, and I’d work on it, then I’d stop working to do commercial work. I work on it. I stop. I work on the movie. It’s like I’m driving this high performance car, but it doesn’t have enough gas in it, so I have to keep stopping and putting gasoline [in it]. So it’s been reinvigorating [to have a new book coming out], because it kick-started everything.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/21/cartoonist-paul-pope-is-more-worried-about-killer-robots-than-ai-plagiarism/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 18:08:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Cloud quantum computing: A trillion-dollar opportunity with dangerous hidden risks (AI News | VentureBeat)</title><link>https://venturebeat.com/security/cloud-quantum-computing-a-trillion-dollar-opportunity-with-dangerous-hidden-risks/</link><description>&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-before" id="boilerplate_2682874"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:separator {"opacity":"css","className":"is-style-wide"} --&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum computing (QC) brings with it a mix of groundbreaking possibilities and significant risks. Major tech players like IBM, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have already rolled out commercial QC cloud services, while specialized firms like Quantinuum and PsiQuantum have quickly achieved unicorn status. Experts predict that the global QC market could add more than $1 trillion to the world’s economy between 2025 and 2035. However, can we say with certainty that the benefits outweigh the risks?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, these cutting-edge systems hold the promise of revolutionizing areas such as drug discovery, climate modeling, AI and maybe even artificial general intelligence (AGI) development. On the other hand, they also introduce serious cybersecurity challenges that should be addressed right now, even though fully functional quantum computers capable of breaking today’s encryption standards are still several years away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-qc-threat-landscape"&gt;Understanding the QC threat landscape&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main cybersecurity fear tied to QC is its potential to break encryption algorithms that have been deemed unbreakable. A survey by KPMG revealed that around 78% of U.S. companies and 60% of Canadian companies anticipate that quantum computers will become mainstream by 2030. More alarmingly, 73% of U.S. respondents and 60% of Canadian respondents believe it’s just a matter of time before cybercriminals start using QC to undermine current security measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern encryption methods rely heavily on mathematical problems that are virtually unsolvable by classical computers, at least within a reasonable timeframe. For instance, factoring the large prime numbers used in RSA encryption would take such a computer around 300 trillion years. However, with Shor’s algorithm (developed in 1994 to help quantum computers factor large numbers quickly), a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could potentially solve this exponentially faster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grover’s algorithm, designed for unstructured search, is a real game-changer when it comes to symmetric encryption methods, as it effectively cuts their security strength in half. For instance, AES-128 encryption would only offer the same level of security as a 64-bit system, leaving it open to quantum attacks. This situation calls for a push towards more robust encryption standards, such as AES-256, which can stand firm against potential quantum threats in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harvesting-now-decrypting-later"&gt;Harvesting now, decrypting later&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most concerning is the “harvest now, decrypt later” (HNDL) attack strategy, which involves adversaries gathering encrypted data today, only to decrypt it once QC technology becomes sufficiently advanced. It poses a significant risk to data that holds long-term value, like health records, financial details, classified government documents and military intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the potentially dire consequences of HNDL attacks, many organizations responsible for vital systems around the world must adopt “crypto agility.” This means they should be ready to swiftly swap out cryptographic algorithms and implementations whenever new vulnerabilities come to light. This concern is also reflected in the U.S. National Security &lt;em&gt;Memorandum on Promoting U.S. Leadership in Quantum Computing While Mitigating Risk to Vulnerable Cryptographic Systems&lt;/em&gt;, which specifically points out this threat and calls for proactive measures to counter it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-threat-timeline"&gt;The threat timeline&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to predicting the timeline for quantum threats, expert opinions are all over the map. A recent report from MITRE suggests that we probably won’t see a quantum computer powerful enough to crack RSA-2048 encryption until around 2055 to 2060, based on the current trends in quantum volume – a metric used to compare the quality of different quantum computers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, some experts are feeling more optimistic. They believe that recent breakthroughs in quantum error correction and algorithm design could speed things up, possibly allowing for quantum decryption capabilities as early as 2035. For instance, researchers Jaime Sevilla and Jess Riedel released a report in late 2020, expressing a 90% confidence that RSA-2048 could be factored before 2060.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the exact timeline is still up in the air, one thing is clear: Experts agree that organizations need to start preparing right away, no matter when the quantum threat actually arrives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-quantum-machine-learning-the-ultimate-black-box"&gt;Quantum machine learning – the ultimate black box?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apart from the questionable crypto agility of today’s organizations, security researchers and futurists have been also worrying about the seemingly inevitable future merging of AI and QS. Quantum technology has the potential to supercharge AI development because it can handle complex calculations at lightning speed. It can play a crucial role in reaching AGI, as today’s AI systems need trillions of parameters to become smarter, which leads to some serious computational hurdles. However, this synergy also opens up scenarios that might be beyond our ability to predict.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You don’t need AGI to grasp the essence of the problem. Imagine if quantum computing were to be integrated into machine learning (ML). We could be looking at what experts call the ultimate black box problem. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are already known for being quite opaque, with hidden layers that even their creators struggle to interpret. While tools for understanding how classical neural networks make decisions already exist, quantum ML would lead to a more confusing situation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The root of the issue lies in the very nature of QC, namely the fact that it uses superposition, entanglement and interference to process information in ways that don’t have any classical equivalents. When these quantum features are applied to ML algorithms, the models that emerge might involve processes that are tough to translate into reasoning that humans can grasp. This raises some rather obvious concerns for vital areas like healthcare, finance and autonomous systems, where understanding AI decisions is crucial for safety and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-post-quantum-cryptography-be-enough"&gt;Will post-quantum cryptography be enough?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To tackle the rising threats posed by QC, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) kicked off its Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization project back in 2016. This involved conducting a thorough review of 69 candidate algorithms from cryptographers around the globe. Upon completing the review, NIST chose several promising methods that rely on structured lattices and hash functions. These are mathematical challenges thought capable of withstanding attacks from both classical and quantum computers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, NIST rolled out detailed post-quantum cryptographic standards, and major tech companies have been taking steps to implement early protections ever since. For instance, Apple unveiled PQ3 — a post-quantum protocol — for its iMessage platform, aimed at safeguarding against advanced quantum attacks. On a similar note, Google has been experimenting with post-quantum algorithms in Chrome since 2016 and is steadily integrating them into its various services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft is making strides in enhancing qubit error correction without disturbing the quantum environment, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability of QC. For instance, earlier this year, the company announced that it has created a “new state of matter” (one in addition to solid, liquid and gas) dubbed “topological qubit,” which could lead to fully realized QCs in years, rather than decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key transition challenges&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the shift to post-quantum cryptography comes with a host of challenges that must be tackled head-on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The implementation timeframe: U.S. officials are predicting it could take anywhere from 10 to 15 years to roll out new cryptographic standards across all systems. This is especially tricky for hardware that’s located in hard-to-reach places like satellites, vehicles and ATMs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The performance impact: Post-quantum encryption usually demands larger key sizes and more complex mathematical operations, which could slow down both encryption and decryption processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A shortage of technical expertise. To successfully integrate quantum-resistant cryptography into existing systems, organizations need highly skilled IT professionals who are well-versed in both classical and quantum concepts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vulnerability discovery: Even the most promising post-quantum algorithms might have hidden weaknesses, as we’ve seen with the NIST-selected CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Supply chain concerns: Essential quantum components, like cryocoolers and specialized lasers, could be affected by geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last but certainly not least, being tech-savvy is going to be crucial in the quantum era. As companies rush to adopt post-quantum cryptography, it’s important to remember that encryption alone won’t shield them from employees who click on harmful links, open dubious email attachments or misuse their access to data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent example is when Microsoft found two applications that unintentionally revealed their private encryption keys — while the underlying math was solid, human error made that protection ineffective. Mistakes in implementation often compromise systems that are theoretically secure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preparing-for-the-quantum-future"&gt;Preparing for the quantum future&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations need to take a few important steps to get ready for the challenges posed by quantum security threats. Here’s what they should do, in very broad terms:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct a cryptographic inventory — take stock of all systems that use encryption and might be at risk from quantum attacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Assess the lifetime value of data — figure out which pieces of information need long-term protection, and prioritize upgrading those systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Develop migration timelines — set up realistic schedules for moving to post-quantum cryptography across all systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Allocate appropriate resources — make sure to budget for the significant costs that come with implementing quantum-resistant security measures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enhance monitoring capabilities – put systems in place to spot potential HNDL attacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michele Mosca has come up with a theorem to help organizations plan for quantum security: If X (the time data needs to stay secure) plus Y (the time it takes to upgrade cryptographic systems) is greater than Z (the time until quantum computers can crack current encryption), organizations must take action right away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re stepping into an era of quantum computing that brings with it some serious cybersecurity challenges, and we all need to act fast, even if we’re not entirely sure when these challenges will fully materialize. It might be decades before we see quantum computers that can break current encryption, but the risks of inaction are simply too great.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vivek Wadhwa of &lt;em&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/em&gt; magazine puts it bluntly: “The world’s failure to rein in AI — or rather, the crude technologies masquerading as such — should serve to be a profound warning. There is an even more powerful emerging technology with the potential to wreak havoc, especially if it is combined with AI: Quantum computing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get ahead of this technological wave, organizations should start implementing post-quantum cryptography, keep an eye on adversarial quantum programs and secure quantum supply chain. It’s crucial to prepare now — before quantum computers suddenly make our current security measures entirely obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum computing (QC) brings with it a mix of groundbreaking possibilities and significant risks. Major tech players like IBM, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have already rolled out commercial QC cloud services, while specialized firms like Quantinuum and PsiQuantum have quickly achieved unicorn status. Experts predict that the global QC market could add more than $1 trillion to the world’s economy between 2025 and 2035. However, can we say with certainty that the benefits outweigh the risks?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, these cutting-edge systems hold the promise of revolutionizing areas such as drug discovery, climate modeling, AI and maybe even artificial general intelligence (AGI) development. On the other hand, they also introduce serious cybersecurity challenges that should be addressed right now, even though fully functional quantum computers capable of breaking today’s encryption standards are still several years away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-qc-threat-landscape"&gt;Understanding the QC threat landscape&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main cybersecurity fear tied to QC is its potential to break encryption algorithms that have been deemed unbreakable. A survey by KPMG revealed that around 78% of U.S. companies and 60% of Canadian companies anticipate that quantum computers will become mainstream by 2030. More alarmingly, 73% of U.S. respondents and 60% of Canadian respondents believe it’s just a matter of time before cybercriminals start using QC to undermine current security measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern encryption methods rely heavily on mathematical problems that are virtually unsolvable by classical computers, at least within a reasonable timeframe. For instance, factoring the large prime numbers used in RSA encryption would take such a computer around 300 trillion years. However, with Shor’s algorithm (developed in 1994 to help quantum computers factor large numbers quickly), a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could potentially solve this exponentially faster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grover’s algorithm, designed for unstructured search, is a real game-changer when it comes to symmetric encryption methods, as it effectively cuts their security strength in half. For instance, AES-128 encryption would only offer the same level of security as a 64-bit system, leaving it open to quantum attacks. This situation calls for a push towards more robust encryption standards, such as AES-256, which can stand firm against potential quantum threats in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harvesting-now-decrypting-later"&gt;Harvesting now, decrypting later&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most concerning is the “harvest now, decrypt later” (HNDL) attack strategy, which involves adversaries gathering encrypted data today, only to decrypt it once QC technology becomes sufficiently advanced. It poses a significant risk to data that holds long-term value, like health records, financial details, classified government documents and military intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the potentially dire consequences of HNDL attacks, many organizations responsible for vital systems around the world must adopt “crypto agility.” This means they should be ready to swiftly swap out cryptographic algorithms and implementations whenever new vulnerabilities come to light. This concern is also reflected in the U.S. National Security &lt;em&gt;Memorandum on Promoting U.S. Leadership in Quantum Computing While Mitigating Risk to Vulnerable Cryptographic Systems&lt;/em&gt;, which specifically points out this threat and calls for proactive measures to counter it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-threat-timeline"&gt;The threat timeline&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to predicting the timeline for quantum threats, expert opinions are all over the map. A recent report from MITRE suggests that we probably won’t see a quantum computer powerful enough to crack RSA-2048 encryption until around 2055 to 2060, based on the current trends in quantum volume – a metric used to compare the quality of different quantum computers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, some experts are feeling more optimistic. They believe that recent breakthroughs in quantum error correction and algorithm design could speed things up, possibly allowing for quantum decryption capabilities as early as 2035. For instance, researchers Jaime Sevilla and Jess Riedel released a report in late 2020, expressing a 90% confidence that RSA-2048 could be factored before 2060.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the exact timeline is still up in the air, one thing is clear: Experts agree that organizations need to start preparing right away, no matter when the quantum threat actually arrives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-quantum-machine-learning-the-ultimate-black-box"&gt;Quantum machine learning – the ultimate black box?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apart from the questionable crypto agility of today’s organizations, security researchers and futurists have been also worrying about the seemingly inevitable future merging of AI and QS. Quantum technology has the potential to supercharge AI development because it can handle complex calculations at lightning speed. It can play a crucial role in reaching AGI, as today’s AI systems need trillions of parameters to become smarter, which leads to some serious computational hurdles. However, this synergy also opens up scenarios that might be beyond our ability to predict.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You don’t need AGI to grasp the essence of the problem. Imagine if quantum computing were to be integrated into machine learning (ML). We could be looking at what experts call the ultimate black box problem. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are already known for being quite opaque, with hidden layers that even their creators struggle to interpret. While tools for understanding how classical neural networks make decisions already exist, quantum ML would lead to a more confusing situation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The root of the issue lies in the very nature of QC, namely the fact that it uses superposition, entanglement and interference to process information in ways that don’t have any classical equivalents. When these quantum features are applied to ML algorithms, the models that emerge might involve processes that are tough to translate into reasoning that humans can grasp. This raises some rather obvious concerns for vital areas like healthcare, finance and autonomous systems, where understanding AI decisions is crucial for safety and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-post-quantum-cryptography-be-enough"&gt;Will post-quantum cryptography be enough?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To tackle the rising threats posed by QC, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) kicked off its Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization project back in 2016. This involved conducting a thorough review of 69 candidate algorithms from cryptographers around the globe. Upon completing the review, NIST chose several promising methods that rely on structured lattices and hash functions. These are mathematical challenges thought capable of withstanding attacks from both classical and quantum computers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, NIST rolled out detailed post-quantum cryptographic standards, and major tech companies have been taking steps to implement early protections ever since. For instance, Apple unveiled PQ3 — a post-quantum protocol — for its iMessage platform, aimed at safeguarding against advanced quantum attacks. On a similar note, Google has been experimenting with post-quantum algorithms in Chrome since 2016 and is steadily integrating them into its various services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft is making strides in enhancing qubit error correction without disturbing the quantum environment, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability of QC. For instance, earlier this year, the company announced that it has created a “new state of matter” (one in addition to solid, liquid and gas) dubbed “topological qubit,” which could lead to fully realized QCs in years, rather than decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key transition challenges&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the shift to post-quantum cryptography comes with a host of challenges that must be tackled head-on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The implementation timeframe: U.S. officials are predicting it could take anywhere from 10 to 15 years to roll out new cryptographic standards across all systems. This is especially tricky for hardware that’s located in hard-to-reach places like satellites, vehicles and ATMs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The performance impact: Post-quantum encryption usually demands larger key sizes and more complex mathematical operations, which could slow down both encryption and decryption processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A shortage of technical expertise. To successfully integrate quantum-resistant cryptography into existing systems, organizations need highly skilled IT professionals who are well-versed in both classical and quantum concepts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vulnerability discovery: Even the most promising post-quantum algorithms might have hidden weaknesses, as we’ve seen with the NIST-selected CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Supply chain concerns: Essential quantum components, like cryocoolers and specialized lasers, could be affected by geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last but certainly not least, being tech-savvy is going to be crucial in the quantum era. As companies rush to adopt post-quantum cryptography, it’s important to remember that encryption alone won’t shield them from employees who click on harmful links, open dubious email attachments or misuse their access to data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent example is when Microsoft found two applications that unintentionally revealed their private encryption keys — while the underlying math was solid, human error made that protection ineffective. Mistakes in implementation often compromise systems that are theoretically secure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preparing-for-the-quantum-future"&gt;Preparing for the quantum future&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations need to take a few important steps to get ready for the challenges posed by quantum security threats. Here’s what they should do, in very broad terms:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct a cryptographic inventory — take stock of all systems that use encryption and might be at risk from quantum attacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Assess the lifetime value of data — figure out which pieces of information need long-term protection, and prioritize upgrading those systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Develop migration timelines — set up realistic schedules for moving to post-quantum cryptography across all systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Allocate appropriate resources — make sure to budget for the significant costs that come with implementing quantum-resistant security measures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enhance monitoring capabilities – put systems in place to spot potential HNDL attacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michele Mosca has come up with a theorem to help organizations plan for quantum security: If X (the time data needs to stay secure) plus Y (the time it takes to upgrade cryptographic systems) is greater than Z (the time until quantum computers can crack current encryption), organizations must take action right away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re stepping into an era of quantum computing that brings with it some serious cybersecurity challenges, and we all need to act fast, even if we’re not entirely sure when these challenges will fully materialize. It might be decades before we see quantum computers that can break current encryption, but the risks of inaction are simply too great.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vivek Wadhwa of &lt;em&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/em&gt; magazine puts it bluntly: “The world’s failure to rein in AI — or rather, the crude technologies masquerading as such — should serve to be a profound warning. There is an even more powerful emerging technology with the potential to wreak havoc, especially if it is combined with AI: Quantum computing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get ahead of this technological wave, organizations should start implementing post-quantum cryptography, keep an eye on adversarial quantum programs and secure quantum supply chain. It’s crucial to prepare now — before quantum computers suddenly make our current security measures entirely obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
