If you’re not there to show off your product, your competitors will be — and they’ll be closing deals that could’ve been yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s still time to &lt;strong&gt;book your exhibit table&lt;/strong&gt;, but space is disappearing fast. The brands that move now will be the ones getting the face time, the leads, and the traction that matters most.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This isn’t an opportunity to sit on. Time is ticking, tables are booking, and every day you wait is lost prep time to showcase your innovation to 10,000+ tech, VC, and startup leaders. &lt;strong&gt;Get more details and book your table here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new feature, which is available in any market where Meta AI is available, allows creators to translate content into other languages so it can be viewed by a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature was first announced at Meta’s Connect developer conference last year, where the company said it would pilot test automatic translations of creators’ voices in reels across both Facebook and Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta notes that the AI translations will use the sound and tone of the creator’s own voice to make the dubbed voice sound authentic when translating the content to a new language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, creators can optionally use a lip-sync feature to align the translation with their lip movements, which makes it seem more natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="a pair of screenshots showing the new translation feature in Instagram" class="wp-image-3037964" height="934" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/meta-ai-translation-reel.webp" width="1236" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At launch, the feature supports translations from English to Spanish and vice versa, with more languages to be added over time. These AI translations are available to Facebook creators with 1,000 or more followers and all public Instagram accounts globally, where Meta AI is offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To access the option, creators can click on “Translate your voice with Meta AI” before publishing their reel. Creators can then toggle the button to turn on translations and choose if they want to include lip-syncing, too. When they click “Share now” to publish their reel, the translation will be available automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Creators can view translations and lip syncs before they’re posted publicly and can toggle off either option at any time. (Rejecting the translation won’t impact the original reel, the company notes.) Viewers watching the translated reel will see a notice at the bottom that indicates it was translated with Meta AI. Those who don’t want to see translated reels in select languages can disable this in the settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="another screenshot from the new feature, showing how users can manage their voice translations" class="wp-image-3037963" height="954" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/meta-ai-translation-notification.webp" width="1242" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Creators are also gaining access to a new metric in their Insights panel, where they can see their views by language. This can help them better understand how their content is reaching new audiences via translations — something that will be more helpful as additional languages are supported over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta recommends that creators who want to use the feature face forward, speak clearly, and avoid covering their mouth when recording. Minimal background noise or music also helps. The feature only supports up to two speakers, and they should not talk over each other for the translation to work.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, Facebook creators will be able to upload up to 20 of their own dubbed audio tracks to a reel to expand their audience beyond those in English- or Spanish-speaking markets. This is offered in the “Closed captions and translations” section of the Meta Business Suite and supports the addition of translations both before and after publishing, unlike the AI feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="a screenshot showing how creators can add translated audio tracks to their uploaded videos." class="wp-image-3037961" height="1006" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/reels-dubbed-translations.webp" width="1410" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta says more languages will be supported in the future but did not detail which ones would be next to come or when.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We believe there are lots of amazing creators out there who have potential audiences who don’t necessarily speak the same language,” explained Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a post on Instagram. “And if we can help you reach those audiences who speak other languages, reach across cultural and linguistic barriers, we can help you grow your following and get more value out of Instagram and the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch of the AI feature comes as multiple reports indicate that Meta is restructuring its AI group again to focus on four key areas: research, superintelligence, products, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta is rolling out an AI-powered voice translation feature to all users on Facebook and Instagram globally, the company announced on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

Four days later, the change has been made official with an internal memo, as reported by Bloomberg and The New York Times. The changes were announced by Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, who joined Meta as chief AI officer in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta’s new organization for AI will be called the Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The centerpiece is a new group called TBD Labs, which will be run by Wang. The group will focus on foundation models like Llama series, which had its latest release in April. The other three groups will focused on research, product integration, and infrastructure, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta has put significant resources into revamping its AI organization in recent months in response to concerns that it was being outpaced by rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. Mark Zuckerberg has been personally involved in recruitment for the new group, per a June report from Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The latest Xcode beta contains clear signs that Apple plans to bring Anthropic's Claude and Opus large language models into the integrated development environment (IDE), expanding on features already available using Apple's own models or OpenAI's ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple enthusiast publication 9to5Mac "found multiple references to built-in support for Anthropic accounts," including in the "Intelligence" menu, where users can currently log into ChatGPT or enter an API key for higher message limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple introduced a suite of features meant to compete with GitHub Copilot in Xcode at WWDC24, but first focused on its own models and a more limited set of use cases. That expanded quite a bit at this year's developer conference, and users can converse about codebases, discuss changes, or ask for suggestions using ChatGPT. They are initially given a limited set of messages, but this can be greatly increased by logging into a ChatGPT account or entering an API key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer, Apple said it would be possible to use Anthropic's models with an API key, too, but made no mention of support for Anthropic accounts, which are generally more cost-effective than using the API for most users.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Now, with 9to5Mac's discovery, it appears that Xcode 26 will ultimately allow users to log in to use Anthropic's models as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude has proven to be one of the most popular models for developers, thanks in part to a wide context window and models more fine-tuned for the task, as Anthropic has a B2B, developer-oriented strategy compared to OpenAI's everything-for-everybody strategy. The release of GPT-5 poses a major challenge for Anthropic, though, as it both significantly improves ChatGPT's coding capabilities while also coming at a much lower cost. Anthropic is likely to answer that with future model updates that aim for greater efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This news is also relevant for the wider Apple ecosystem, not just developers, as it's the first clear example of Apple working on support for a third-party model besides those offered by OpenAI. The company's executives have often said they planned to do that in the future in Xcode and in Siri, but until now, we haven't seen much beyond statements of intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xcode 26 is expected to launch alongside the new version of macOS later this year. It's unclear whether this Anthropic account support will come with the initial release or an update further down the line in this annual cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
