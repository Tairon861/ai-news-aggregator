&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new rate limits will go into effect August 28 for subscribers to Anthropic’s $20-per-month Pro plan, as well as its $100- and $200-per-month Max plans, the company said Monday in an email to subscribers and a post on X. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;We’re rolling out new weekly rate limits for Claude Pro and Max in late August. We estimate they’ll apply to less than 5% of subscribers based on current usage. pic.twitter.com/X8FAss3jIC&lt;/p&gt;— Anthropic (@AnthropicAI) July 28, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic says its existing usage limits, which reset every five hours, will remain in place. The company is also introducing two new weekly rate limits that reset every seven days; one is an overall usage limit, whereas the other is specific to Anthropic’s most advanced AI model, Claude Opus 4. Anthropic says Max subscribers can purchase additional usage, beyond what the rate limit provides, at standard API rates.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement comes just weeks after Anthropic quietly introduced rate limits for Claude Code. The company said at the time it was aware of the issues but declined to elaborate further. While Anthropic’s AI coding tool has been a hit with developers, the company seems to be having a difficult time serving it broadly. Anthropic’s status page shows that Claude Code has experienced a partial or major outage at least seven times in the last month — perhaps because some power users seem to be running Claude Code nonstop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Claude Code has experienced unprecedented demand since launch,” said Anthropic spokesperson Amie Rotherham in an email to TechCrunch about the weekly rate limits. Rotherham notes that “most users won’t notice a difference,” and that this limit will affect less than 5% of subscribers, based on their current usage patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic tells TechCrunch that most Pro users can expect 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 through Claude Code within their weekly rate limits. Subscribers to Anthropic’s $100-per-month Max plan can expect 140 to 280 hours of Sonnet 4 and 15 to 35 hours of Opus 4. And subscribers to Anthropic’s $200-per-month Max plan can expect 240 to 480 hours of Sonnet 4 and 24 to 40 hours of Opus 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company notes that usage may vary based on codebase size and other factors, however, it’s somewhat unclear how Anthropic is measuring usage here. Anthropic claims that the $200 Max plan offers 20x more usage than the Pro plan — but based on the updated figures, subscribers now get only about 6x as many Claude Code hours as Pro users.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s possible the 20x figure still applies when measured in tokens or compute, but the company didn’t immediately clarify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic has said before that it’s very constrained when it comes to computational resources, which seems to be the case for most AI model providers today. Most AI companies are racing to bring new AI data centers online to meet the massive demands of serving and training their AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several providers of AI coding tools are revisiting the pricing strategy around their products. In June, the company behind Cursor, Anysphere, changed the way it priced usage for its $20-per-month Pro plan to limit power users from abusing the plan. However, Anysphere later apologized for poorly communicating those changes, leading to some users paying more than they expected. Another AI coding tool provider, Replit, made similar pricing changes in June as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an email to Claude subscribers, Anthropic says it’s committed to “supporting long-running use cases through other options in the future.” However, the company claims these rate limits will help them maintain reliable service broadly in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 4:45 p.m. PT: This story was updated to include comments from an Anthropic spokesperson and more details about Anthropic’s weekly rate limits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/YouTube-Thumb-Text-2-3.png?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Anthropic says its rolling out new weekly rate limits for Claude to curb usage among subscribers who are running its AI coding tool, Claude Code, “continuously in the background, 24/7.” Anthropic says the rate limits also aim to stop a handful of users who are violating Claude’s usage policy by sharing accounts and reselling access to Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is that the AI can become a helper that can understand what the user is researching, predict what they want to do, and then take action on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;How well it works in practice remains to be seen, but Microsoft notes that Copilot Mode is still considered an experimental feature. It’s also opt-in by default during these tests and is currently free for any Mac or PC users with access to Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are a few main components to Copilot Mode at launch, with more on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once enabled, Edge users will be presented with a new tab page where they can search, chat, and navigate the web with Copilot’s assistance. When visiting a specific web page, they can also turn to Copilot for more help. For example, Microsoft shows how someone might ask the AI companion if a recipe they’re viewing could be made vegan instead, and Copilot suggests substitutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This type of question is something users might ask an AI chatbot today, but this saves the step of having to paste in the content they want to reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or, someone could just ask the AI to simply present the recipe itself so they can skip reading through the “life story” that now accompanies so many online recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3031678" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Microsoft claims that Copilot can handle a variety of tasks on a user’s behalf, like booking appointments, creating shopping lists, and drafting content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This “agentic” use of the web is the next big leap in the AI browser race, but it’s unclear if consumer adoption will naturally follow. The goal, of course, is to make it easier to perform everyday tasks, like reserving a room on Booking.com or a flight via Kayak. However, chatting back-and-forth with an AI to go through the options and your needs isn’t necessarily better or faster than just doing it yourself, depending on your familiarity with the website in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, Copilot does allow for voice input, which could be handy for people who aren’t as tech-savvy when it comes to booking things online, or for those who have limited mobility. (Later on, Microsoft says users will be able to give Copilot the additional context it needs, like credentials or history, to manage more advanced actions, like bookings. For now, it’s a bit more manual.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What’s more interesting, perhaps, is Copilot’s ability to be a research companion. With the user’s permission, Copilot can view all open tabs to understand what the person is browsing. This could be useful if they’re doing some type of product comparison or online research, like pricing flights or hotels across multiple sites. Again, these are use cases for AI chatbots, but baking it into the browser could speed up the process of translating the user’s needs to the digital helper.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the future, Copilot will also prompt people to pick up where they left off on a project or something they’re researching, by recommending next steps, Microsoft says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company stresses that Copilot will only be able to access someone’s browsing content when they choose to allow it, and this will be made transparent to the end user with visual cues. However, the idea that you can now toggle on or off a feature that’s able to view and listen to you while you search could leave some people unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;With demand for AI-powered browsers on the rise, Microsoft on Monday launched a new feature in its Edge browser called Copilot Mode, which allows users to browse the web while being assisted by AI.

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, OpenAI's new ChatGPT Agent, which can perform multistep tasks for users, proved it can pass through one of the Internet's most common security checkpoints by clicking Cloudflare's anti-bot verification—the same checkbox that's supposed to keep automated programs like itself at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Agent is a feature that allows OpenAI's AI assistant to control its own web browser, operating within a sandboxed environment with its own virtual operating system and browser that can access the real Internet. Users can watch the AI's actions through a window in the ChatGPT interface, maintaining oversight while the agent completes tasks. The system requires user permission before taking actions with real-world consequences, such as making purchases. Recently, Reddit users discovered the agent could do something particularly ironic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence came from Reddit, where a user named "logkn" of the r/OpenAI community posted screenshots of the AI agent effortlessly clicking through the screening step before it would otherwise present a CAPTCHA (short for "Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart") while completing a video conversion task—narrating its own process as it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2108820 align-fullwidth"&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screenshots shared on Reddit capture the agent navigating a two-step verification process: first clicking the "Verify you are human" checkbox, then proceeding to click a "Convert" button after the Cloudflare challenge succeeds. The agent provides real-time narration of its actions, stating "The link is inserted, so now I'll click the 'Verify you are human' checkbox to complete the verification on Cloudflare. This step is necessary to prove I'm not a bot and proceed with the action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absurdity of an AI agent declaring it needs to prove it's "not a bot" while clicking through anti-bot measures has not been lost on observers. "In all fairness, it’s been trained on human data why would it identify as a bot? We should respect that choice," joked one Reddit user in a reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The CAPTCHA arms race&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the agent didn't face an actual CAPTCHA puzzle with images in this case, successfully passing Cloudflare's behavioral screening that determines whether to present such challenges demonstrates sophisticated browser automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the significance of this capability, it's important to know that CAPTCHA systems have served as a security measure on the web for decades. Computer researchers invented the technique in the 1990s to screen bots from entering information into websites, originally using images with letters and numbers written in wiggly fonts, often obscured with lines or noise to foil computer vision algorithms. The assumption is that the task will be easy for humans but difficult for machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's screening system, called Turnstile, often precedes actual CAPTCHA challenges and represents one of the most widely deployed bot-detection methods today. The checkbox analyzes multiple signals, including mouse movements, click timing, browser fingerprints, IP reputation, and JavaScript execution patterns to determine if the user exhibits human-like behavior. If these checks pass, users proceed without seeing a CAPTCHA puzzle. If the system detects suspicious patterns, it escalates to visual challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability for an AI model to defeat a CAPTCHA isn't entirely new (although having one narrate the process feels fairly novel). AI tools have been able to defeat certain CAPTCHAs for a while, which has led to an arms race between those that create them and those that defeat them. OpenAI's Operator, an experimental web-browsing AI agent launched in January, faced difficulty clicking through some CAPTCHAs (and was also trained to stop and ask a human to complete them), but the latest ChatGPT Agent tool has seen a much wider release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's tempting to say that the ability of AI agents to pass these tests puts the future effectiveness of CAPTCHAs into question, but for as long as there have been CAPTCHAs, there have been bots that could later defeat them. As a result, recent CAPTCHAs have become more of a way to slow down bot attacks or make them more expensive rather than a way to defeat them entirely. Some malefactors even hire out farms of humans to defeat them in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;CAPTCHAs also have unexpected benefits for those who run them. Since 2007, the reCAPTCHA project began using its tests as a form of free labor for tasks like digitizing books and training machine-learning algorithms. Google acquired reCAPTCHA in 2009 and expanded its use to decode Google Street View addresses, extracting vision knowledge from human users solving challenges. Today's reCAPTCHA challenges help Google train AI models for image recognition—creating an ironic cycle where humans proving they're not robots are actually helping to make AI better at defeating future CAPTCHAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, that future may have arrived. ChatGPT Agent's demonstration showcases the agent tool's ability to process visual context and navigate multi-step processes that would typically require human judgment. In the screenshots, the agent recognizes when verification is needed and completes it as part of a larger workflow—behavior that goes beyond simple scripted automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAPTCHAs are just one example of the complex tasks ChatGPT Agent can handle. For example, another Reddit user showed off a photo of a load of groceries that Agent apparently purchased. "I had agent mode order me some groceries from a local supermarket while I worked yesterday for pickup this morning," the Reddit user wrote. "It actually worked without any issue and did an okay job making a grocery list that works for me. I gave it barely any detail in my instructions other than to avoid red meat, prioritize health and keep it under $150."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ChatGPT Agent isn't perfect. Some terrible website user interfaces are apparently better than CAPTCHA checkpoints at foiling the new bot. "Your agent did way better than mine," wrote one Reddit reply. "Mine couldn’t figure out how to get to the stop and shop website."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, OpenAI's new ChatGPT Agent, which can perform multistep tasks for users, proved it can pass through one of the Internet's most common security checkpoints by clicking Cloudflare's anti-bot verification—the same checkbox that's supposed to keep automated programs like itself at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Agent is a feature that allows OpenAI's AI assistant to control its own web browser, operating within a sandboxed environment with its own virtual operating system and browser that can access the real Internet. Users can watch the AI's actions through a window in the ChatGPT interface, maintaining oversight while the agent completes tasks. The system requires user permission before taking actions with real-world consequences, such as making purchases. Recently, Reddit users discovered the agent could do something particularly ironic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence came from Reddit, where a user named "logkn" of the r/OpenAI community posted screenshots of the AI agent effortlessly clicking through the screening step before it would otherwise present a CAPTCHA (short for "Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart") while completing a video conversion task—narrating its own process as it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;


  

  
      
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next front in Donald Trump's trade war will be chip tariffs—which could come by next month—but national security experts are warning that the president may have already made a huge misstep that threatens to disrupt both US trade and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter Monday to Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, 20 policymakers and professionals with a background in national security policy urged Trump to reverse course and block exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, the Trump administration decided against imposing additional export curbs on H20 chips after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang paid $1 million for a seat at a Mar-a-Lago dinner, NPR reported. Apparently, Nvidia's promise to invest $500 billion in AI data centers helped persuade Trump to change course, as did the terms of a temporary truce with China, in which the US promised to halt H20 chip controls in exchange for China restoring imports of rare earth minerals into the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their letter, national security experts expressed "deep concern" that Trump may not have considered how Nvidia's H20 chips could endanger the US military's "edge in artificial intelligence" while serving as a "potent accelerator of China’s frontier AI capabilities."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these chips can't be used for AI training like the Blackwell and H100 chips still restricted by export curbs, they're "optimized for inference, the process responsible for the dramatic capabilities gains made by the latest generation of frontier AI reasoning models," experts warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely, China will use the chips for AI models deployed by its military to "enable autonomous weapons systems, intelligence surveillance platforms, and rapid advances in battlefield decision-making," experts said. In that way, "by supplying China with these chips, we are fueling the very infrastructure that will be used to modernize and expand the Chinese military," they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is notably investigating how chip tariffs and imports could harm national security, with a report due out in two weeks, Lutnick announced today. That report will supposedly help Trump determine if relying too much on other countries for chips poses a national security threat.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But experts seem to fear that Trump isn't paying enough attention to how exports of US technology could threaten to not only supercharge China's military and AI capabilities but also drain supplies that US firms need to keep the US at the forefront of AI innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More chips for China means fewer chips for the US," experts said, noting that "China’s biggest tech firms, including Tencent, ByteDance, and Alibaba," have spent $16 billion on bulk-ordered H20 chips over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, "projected data center demand from the US power market would require 90 percent of global chip supply through 2030, an unlikely scenario even without China joining the rush to buy advanced AI chips," experts said. If Trump doesn't intervene, one of America's biggest AI rivals could even end up driving up costs of AI chips for US firms, they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We urge you to reverse course," the letter concluded. "This is not a question of trade. It is a question of national security."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trump says he never heard of Nvidia before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the bigger problem for Trump, national security experts suggest, would be if China or other trade partners perceive the US resolve to wield export controls as a foreign policy tool to be "weakened" by Trump reversing course on H20 controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They suggested that Trump caving on H20 controls could even "embolden China to seek additional access concessions" at a time when some analysts suggest that China may already have an upper hand in trade negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China are largely expected to extend a 90-day truce following recent talks in Stockholm, Reuters reported. Anonymous sources told the South China Morning Post that the US may have already agreed to not impose any new tariffs or otherwise ratchet up the trade war during that truce, but that remains unconfirmed, as Trump continues to warn that chip tariffs are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has recently claimed that he thinks he may be close to cementing a deal with China, but it appears likely that talks will continue well into the fall. A meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping probably won't be scheduled until late October or early November, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;For Trump, appearing weak on export controls could give China leverage. China's sticking point in negotiations is seemingly that the US is trying to stunt its growth through the trade war, Reuters noted. And a recent editorial in the People's Daily, "the mouthpiece of China’s ruling Communist Party" insisted that China remains "firmly opposed to any attempt to undermine the multilateral trading system through unilateralism and protectionism" like US export curbs, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Trump already backed down from export curbs once, experts fear he may never revive the H20 curbs, possibly choosing to prioritize closing a potential trade deal with China over safeguarding national security. If other countries perceive that "tension"—that Trump will sacrifice national security priorities for trade war wins—it could result in more unfavorable outcomes, heightening national security risks in Trump's other trade deals, experts suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For national security experts, it seems the time has come to scrutinize just how much Trump knows about AI or else risk "a strategic misstep that endangers the United States’ economic and military edge" in AI—"an area increasingly seen as decisive in 21st-century global leadership."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their doubts about Trump's understanding of the AI industry may be warranted, given an eyebrow-raising admission Trump made while unveiling his AI Action Plan last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his speech, Trump confessed that he had threatened to break up Nvidia before he even knew what one of the world's most valuable AI companies even did, Tom's Hardware reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Nvidia's Huang an "amazing" AI industry leader, Trump said he made the threat "before I learned the facts of life"—basically that a breakup would be "very hard" since Nvidia has somewhere between 70 to 95 percent of the market share for AI chips. Since Trump campaigned on using tariffs to strong-arm tech companies into diverting manufacturing into the US—partly to win the AI race—it seems surprising that he wouldn't be aware of the leading AI chip firm that depends heavily on both US and Chinese markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I said, 'What the hell is Nvidia?' I've never heard of it before," Trump said just days ago. "I figured we could go in and we could sort of break them up a little bit, get them a little competition, and I found it's not easy in that business."&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They suggested that Trump caving on H20 controls could even "embolden China to seek additional access concessions" at a time when some analysts suggest that China may already have an upper hand in trade negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China are largely expected to extend a 90-day truce following recent talks in Stockholm, Reuters reported. Anonymous sources told the South China Morning Post that the US may have already agreed to not impose any new tariffs or otherwise ratchet up the trade war during that truce, but that remains unconfirmed, as Trump continues to warn that chip tariffs are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has recently claimed that he thinks he may be close to cementing a deal with China, but it appears likely that talks will continue well into the fall. A meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping probably won't be scheduled until late October or early November, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;For Trump, appearing weak on export controls could give China leverage. China's sticking point in negotiations is seemingly that the US is trying to stunt its growth through the trade war, Reuters noted. And a recent editorial in the People's Daily, "the mouthpiece of China’s ruling Communist Party" insisted that China remains "firmly opposed to any attempt to undermine the multilateral trading system through unilateralism and protectionism" like US export curbs, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Trump already backed down from export curbs once, experts fear he may never revive the H20 curbs, possibly choosing to prioritize closing a potential trade deal with China over safeguarding national security. If other countries perceive that "tension"—that Trump will sacrifice national security priorities for trade war wins—it could result in more unfavorable outcomes, heightening national security risks in Trump's other trade deals, experts suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For national security experts, it seems the time has come to scrutinize just how much Trump knows about AI or else risk "a strategic misstep that endangers the United States’ economic and military edge" in AI—"an area increasingly seen as decisive in 21st-century global leadership."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their doubts about Trump's understanding of the AI industry may be warranted, given an eyebrow-raising admission Trump made while unveiling his AI Action Plan last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his speech, Trump confessed that he had threatened to break up Nvidia before he even knew what one of the world's most valuable AI companies even did, Tom's Hardware reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Nvidia's Huang an "amazing" AI industry leader, Trump said he made the threat "before I learned the facts of life"—basically that a breakup would be "very hard" since Nvidia has somewhere between 70 to 95 percent of the market share for AI chips. Since Trump campaigned on using tariffs to strong-arm tech companies into diverting manufacturing into the US—partly to win the AI race—it seems surprising that he wouldn't be aware of the leading AI chip firm that depends heavily on both US and Chinese markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I said, 'What the hell is Nvidia?' I've never heard of it before," Trump said just days ago. "I figured we could go in and we could sort of break them up a little bit, get them a little competition, and I found it's not easy in that business."&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With this launch, the company aims to broaden access to Aristotle, which Harmonic claims to offer “hallucination-free” answers for questions involving mathematical reasoning — a bold claim given the reliability problems of today’s AI models. Harmonic is focused on creating “mathematical superintelligence” or MSI; the startup eventually wants to help users with all fields that rely on math, including physics, statistics, and computer science.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“[Aristotle] is the first product available to people that does reasoning and formally verifies the output,” said Harmonic CEO and co-founder Tudor Achim in an interview with TechCrunch. “Within the domains that Aristotle supports, which are quantitative reasoning domains, we actually do guarantee that there’s no hallucinations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eventually, Harmonic says it also plans to release an API to let enterprises access Aristotle, as well as a web app for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Harmonic says Aristotle achieved gold medal performance on the 2025 International Math Olympiad (IMO) through a formal test (meaning the problems were translated into a machine‑readable format). Google and OpenAI also developed AI models that achieved gold medal performance on this year’s IMO, but through informal tests taken in natural language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Harmonic says it’s not releasing other benchmarks for Aristotle at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The beta launch of Aristotle comes just a few weeks since Harmonic raised $100 million in a Series B round led by Kleiner Perkins at an $875 million valuation. Achim claims that Harmonic is “advancing very rapidly along” its path to achieving MSI and that investors believed that was a fair valuation given the scope of his startup’s ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several leading tech companies are focused on training their AI models to solve math problems. AI that can do math is valuable in its own right, but math is also considered a uniquely verifiable domain that demands core reasoning skills. Systems that develop these capabilities may prove useful in other domains as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Achim says that Harmonic achieves its hyper-accurate solutions by having Aristotle produce responses in the open source programming language Lean. Before Aristotle gives an answer to users, he says the model double-checks that the solution is correct through an algorithmic process that doesn’t involve AI. Harmonic’s CEO notes that similar technology is used to verify outputs in high-stakes fields such as medical devices and aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even in a narrow domain, achieving hallucination-free performance from an AI model is an incredibly difficult task. Studies have found that even leading AI models hallucinate a lot, and the problem doesn’t appear to be getting better. OpenAI’s latest AI reasoning models hallucinate more than its older ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1047349788-1.jpg?resize=1200,816" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Harmonic, an AI startup co-founded by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, announced Monday the beta launch of an iOS and Android chatbot app where users can access its AI model, Aristotle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Horizon VC, 8VC, Y Combinator, and the AI Grant accelerator participated in the round, along with several high-profile angel investors, including Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, and Twilio co-founder Jeff Lawson, among others.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founder Rahul Sonwalkar launched Julius after graduating from Y Combinator in 2022 and pivoting away from the logistics startup he’d been building during the accelerator program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Julius is designed to act like a data scientist by analyzing and visualizing extensive datasets and then performing predictive modeling from natural language prompts. Even with functionality similar to that found in ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini, Julius has carved out its own niche. The company said it has more than 2 million users and generates more than 10 million visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The easiest way to use Julius is to just talk to it,” Sonwalkar told TechCrunch in an earlier interview. “You can talk to the AI like you would talk to an analyst on your team, and the AI, like a human, would go run the code and do the analysis for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions that Julius can answer and present in a chart include: “Can you visualize how revenue and net income correlate for different industries in China versus US?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Julius’ specialization in data science even caught the eye of Harvard Business School (HBS) professor Iavor Bojinov last year. Bojinov was so impressed he asked Sonwalkar to modify Julius specifically for HBS’ new required course called&amp;nbsp;Data Science and AI for Leaders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“People told us you’re not going to succeed,” Sonwalkar said about building a product that’s similar to features available from the foundational model companies. &amp;nbsp;“What we found was that being focused on a use case is really important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While going through YC, Sonwalkar also masterminded a viral prank. The morning after Elon Musk acquired Twitter (now X), reporters encountered two men with boxes outside the company’s headquarters. One of the two men was Sonwalkar, who introduced himself as a recently laid-off Twitter engineer “Rahul Ligma.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite some notoriety gained from the stunt, Sonwalkar insists that his startup is a lot more attention-worthy.&lt;/p&gt;
