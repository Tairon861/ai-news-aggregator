Announced today, the agreement is designed to break down data silos and accelerate the deployment of AI models from the data centre to the tactical edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CIOs, it’s part of a broader move away from fragmented and project-specific AI pilots toward a more platform engineering approach. By standardising on Red Hat’s infrastructure, the MOD aims to decouple its AI capabilities from underlying hardware, allowing algorithms to be developed once and deployed anywhere—whether on-premise, in the cloud, or on disconnected field devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-red-hat-industrialises-the-ai-lifecycle-for-the-mod"&gt;Red Hat industrialises the AI lifecycle for the MOD&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement focuses on the Defence Digital Foundry, the MOD’s central software delivery hub. The Foundry will now provide a consistent MLOps environment to all service branches, including the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of this initiative is Red Hat AI, a suite that includes Red Hat OpenShift AI. This platform addresses a familiar bottleneck in enterprise AI: the “inference gap” between data science teams and operational infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new agreement will allow MOD developers to collaborate on a single platform, choosing the most appropriate AI models and hardware accelerators for their specific mission requirements without being locked into a single vendor’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This standardisation is vital for “enabling AI at scale,” according to Red Hat. By unifying disparate efforts, the MOD intends to reduce the duplication that often plagues large government IT programs. The platform supports optimised inference, ensuring that AI models can run efficiently on restricted hardware footprints often found in military environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mivy James, CTO at the UK MOD, said: “Easing access to Red Hat platforms becomes all the more important for the UK Ministry of Defence in the era of AI, where rapid adoption, replicating good practice, and the ability to scale are critical to strategic advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bridging-legacy-and-autonomous-systems"&gt;Bridging legacy and autonomous systems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major hurdle for defence modernisation is the coexistence of legacy virtualised workloads with modern, containerised AI applications. The agreement includes Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, which provides a “well-lit migration path” for existing systems. This allows the MOD to manage traditional virtual machines alongside new neural networks on the same control plane to reduce operational complexity and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MOD deal also incorporates Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to drive enterprise-wide AI automation. In an AI context, automation is the enforcement mechanism for governance. It ensures that as models are retrained and redeployed, the underlying configuration management, security orchestration, and service provisioning remain compliant with rigorous defence standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-and-ecosystem-alignment"&gt;Security and ecosystem alignment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploying AI in defence naturally requires a “consistent security footprint” that can withstand sophisticated cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red Hat platform enables DevSecOps practices, integrating security gates directly into the software supply chain. This is particularly relevant for maintaining a trusted software pedigree when integrating code from approved third-party providers, who can now align their deliverables with the MOD’s standardised Red Hat environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joanna Hodgson, Regional Manager for the UK and Ireland at Red Hat, commented: “Red Hat offers flexibility and scalability to deploy any application or any AI model on their choice of hardware – whether on premise, in any cloud, or at the edge – helping the UK Ministry of Defence to harness the latest technologies, including AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deployment shows that AI maturity is moving beyond the model itself to the infrastructure that supports it. Success in high-stakes environments like defence depends less on individual algorithm performance and more on the ability to reliably deliver, update, and govern those models at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese hyperscalers and industry-specific agentic AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111908" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Despite these advantages, the industry has largely failed to advance beyond pilot programmes. Research suggests only seven percent of insurers have scaled these initiatives effectively across their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barrier is rarely a lack of interest. Instead, legacy infrastructure and fragmented data architectures often stop integration before it starts. Financial pressure compounds the technical debt. The sector has absorbed losses exceeding $100 billion annually for six consecutive years. High-frequency property losses are now a structural issue that standard operational tweaks cannot fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-automating-complex-insurance-workflows-with-agentic-ai"&gt;Automating complex insurance workflows with agentic AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligent agents provide a way to bypass these bottlenecks. Unlike passive analytical tools, these systems support autonomous tasks and help make decisions under human supervision. Embedding these agents into workflows allows companies to navigate legacy constraints and talent shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workforce augmentation is a primary application. Sedgwick, in collaboration with Microsoft, deployed the Sidekick Agent to assist claims professionals. The system improved claims processing efficiency by more than 30 percent through real-time guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational gains extend to customer support. Standard chatbots usually answer a query or transfer the user to a queue. An agentic solution manages the process from end-to-end. This can include capturing the first notice of loss, requesting missing documentation, updating policy and billing systems, and proactively notifying customers of next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “resolve, not route” approach has produced results in live environments. One major insurer implemented over 80 models in its claims domain. The rollout cut complex-case liability assessment time by 23 days and improved routing accuracy by 30 percent. Customer complaints fell by 65 percent during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such promising metrics indicate that agentic AI can compress cycle times and control loss-adjustment expenses for the insurance industry, all while maintaining necessary oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-navigating-internal-friction"&gt;Navigating internal friction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption requires navigating internal resistance. Siloed teams and unclear priorities often slow deployment speed. A shortage of talent in specialised roles, such as actuarial analysis and underwriting, also limits how effectively companies use their data. Agentic AI can target these areas to augment roles that are hard to fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success relies on aligning technology with specific business goals. Establishing an ‘AI Center of Excellence’ provides the governance and technical expertise needed to stop fragmented adoption. Teams should start with the high-volume and repeatable tasks to refine models through feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry accelerators can also speed up the process. Many platforms are now available with prebuilt frameworks that can support the full lifecycle of agent deployment. This approach reduces implementation time and aids compliance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, technology matters less than organisational readiness. About 70 percent of scaling challenges are organisational rather than technical. Insurers must build a culture of accountability to see returns on these tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI is a necessity for insurance leaders trying to survive in a market defined by financial pressure and legacy complexity. Addressing structural challenges improves efficiency and resilience.

Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. As a result some previous analyses have suggested that fossil-fuel vehicles would dominate in Africa through at least 2050.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Electric two-wheelers, cars, larger automobiles, and even minibuses could compete in most African countries in just 15 years, according to the new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Energy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“EVs have serious economic potential in most African countries in the not-so-distant future,” says Bessie Noll, a senior researcher at ETH Zürich and one of the authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The study considered the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of a vehicle. That includes the sticker price, financing costs, and the cost of fueling (or charging). The researchers didn’t consider policy-related costs like taxes, import fees, and government subsidies, choosing to focus instead on only the underlying economics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EVs are getting cheaper every year as battery and vehicle manufacturing improve and production scales, and the researchers found that in most cases and in most places across Africa, EVs are expected to be cheaper than equivalent gas-powered vehicles by 2040. EVs should also be less expensive than vehicles that use synthetic fuels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;For two-wheelers like electric scooters, EVs could be the cheaper option even sooner: with smaller, cheaper batteries, these vehicles will be economically competitive by the end of the decade. On the other hand, one of the most difficult segments for EVs to compete in is small cars, says Christian Moretti, a researcher at ETH Zürich and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because some countries still have limited or unreliable grid access, charging is a major barrier to EV uptake, Noll says. So for EVs, the authors analyzed the cost of buying not only the vehicle but also a solar off-grid charging system. This includes solar panels, batteries, and the inverter required to transform the electricity into a version that can charge an EV. (The additional batteries help the system store energy for charging at times when the sun isn’t shining.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mini grids and other standalone systems that include solar panels and energy storage are increasingly common across Africa. It’s possible that this might be a primary way that EV owners in Africa will charge their vehicles in the future, Noll says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the bigger barriers to EVs in Africa is financing costs, she adds. In some cases, the cost of financing can be more than the up-front cost of the vehicle, significantly driving up the cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, EVs are more expensive than equivalent gas-powered vehicles in much of the world. But in places where it’s relatively cheap to borrow money, that difference can be spread out across the course of a vehicle’s whole lifetime for little cost. Then, since it’s often cheaper to charge an EV than fuel a gas-powered car, the EV is less expensive over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some African countries, however, political instability and uncertain economic conditions make borrowing money more expensive. To some extent, the high financing costs affect the purchase of any vehicle, regardless of how it’s powered. But EVs are more expensive up front than equivalent gas-powered cars, and that higher up-front cost adds up to more interest paid over time. In some cases, financing an EV can also be more expensive than financing a gas vehicle—the technology is newer, and banks may see the purchase as more of a risk and charge a higher interest rate, says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The picture varies widely depending on the country, too. In South Africa, Mauritius, and Botswana, financing conditions are already close to levels required to allow EVs to reach cost parity, according to the study. In higher-risk countries (the study gives examples including Sudan, which is currently in a civil war, and Ghana, which is recovering from a major economic crisis), financing costs would need to be cut drastically for that to be the case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making EVs an affordable option will be a key first step to putting more on the roads in Africa and around the world. “People will start to pick up these technologies when they’re competitive,” says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Solar-based charging systems, like the ones mentioned in the study, could help make electricity less of a constraint, bringing more EVs to the roads, Nsitem says. But there’s still a need for more charging infrastructure, a major challenge in many countries where the grid needs major upgrades for capacity and reliability, he adds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Globally, more EVs are hitting the roads every year. “The global trend is unmistakable,” Carlin says. There are questions about how quickly it’s happening in different places, he says, “but the momentum is there.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP24304431552828.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. As a result some previous analyses have suggested that fossil-fuel vehicles would dominate in Africa through at least 2050.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Electric two-wheelers, cars, larger automobiles, and even minibuses could compete in most African countries in just 15 years, according to the new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Energy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“EVs have serious economic potential in most African countries in the not-so-distant future,” says Bessie Noll, a senior researcher at ETH Zürich and one of the authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The study considered the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of a vehicle. That includes the sticker price, financing costs, and the cost of fueling (or charging). The researchers didn’t consider policy-related costs like taxes, import fees, and government subsidies, choosing to focus instead on only the underlying economics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EVs are getting cheaper every year as battery and vehicle manufacturing improve and production scales, and the researchers found that in most cases and in most places across Africa, EVs are expected to be cheaper than equivalent gas-powered vehicles by 2040. EVs should also be less expensive than vehicles that use synthetic fuels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;For two-wheelers like electric scooters, EVs could be the cheaper option even sooner: with smaller, cheaper batteries, these vehicles will be economically competitive by the end of the decade. On the other hand, one of the most difficult segments for EVs to compete in is small cars, says Christian Moretti, a researcher at ETH Zürich and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because some countries still have limited or unreliable grid access, charging is a major barrier to EV uptake, Noll says. So for EVs, the authors analyzed the cost of buying not only the vehicle but also a solar off-grid charging system. This includes solar panels, batteries, and the inverter required to transform the electricity into a version that can charge an EV. (The additional batteries help the system store energy for charging at times when the sun isn’t shining.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mini grids and other standalone systems that include solar panels and energy storage are increasingly common across Africa. It’s possible that this might be a primary way that EV owners in Africa will charge their vehicles in the future, Noll says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the bigger barriers to EVs in Africa is financing costs, she adds. In some cases, the cost of financing can be more than the up-front cost of the vehicle, significantly driving up the cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, EVs are more expensive than equivalent gas-powered vehicles in much of the world. But in places where it’s relatively cheap to borrow money, that difference can be spread out across the course of a vehicle’s whole lifetime for little cost. Then, since it’s often cheaper to charge an EV than fuel a gas-powered car, the EV is less expensive over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some African countries, however, political instability and uncertain economic conditions make borrowing money more expensive. To some extent, the high financing costs affect the purchase of any vehicle, regardless of how it’s powered. But EVs are more expensive up front than equivalent gas-powered cars, and that higher up-front cost adds up to more interest paid over time. In some cases, financing an EV can also be more expensive than financing a gas vehicle—the technology is newer, and banks may see the purchase as more of a risk and charge a higher interest rate, says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The picture varies widely depending on the country, too. In South Africa, Mauritius, and Botswana, financing conditions are already close to levels required to allow EVs to reach cost parity, according to the study. In higher-risk countries (the study gives examples including Sudan, which is currently in a civil war, and Ghana, which is recovering from a major economic crisis), financing costs would need to be cut drastically for that to be the case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making EVs an affordable option will be a key first step to putting more on the roads in Africa and around the world. “People will start to pick up these technologies when they’re competitive,” says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Solar-based charging systems, like the ones mentioned in the study, could help make electricity less of a constraint, bringing more EVs to the roads, Nsitem says.

The bank also raised its performance targets out through 2028, aiming for a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of more than 14 %, up from a previous goal of above 12 % by 2026. A growing US business and cost reductions underpinned this outcome, with Barclays citing AI as a key driver of those efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time when many large companies are still experimenting with AI pilots, Barclays is tying the technology directly to its cost structure and profit outlook. In public statements and investor filings, leadership positions AI as one of the levers that can help the bank sustain lower costs and improved returns, especially as macroeconomic conditions shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays’ 12 % profit rise this week matters, not just for its shareholders, but because it reflects a trend that traditional, highly regulated firms are now positioning AI as a core part of running the business, not something kept in separate innovation labs. For companies outside tech, linking AI to measurable results such as profit and efficiency marks a shift toward operational use over hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-ai-matters-for-cost-discipline"&gt;Why AI matters for cost discipline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays has said that technology such as AI is part of its plan to cut costs and make its operations more efficient. That includes trimming parts of the legacy technology stack and rethinking where and how work happens. Investment in AI tools complements broader cost savings goals that stretch back multiple years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many large companies, labour and legacy systems still make up a large chunk of operating expenses. Using AI to automate repetitive tasks or streamline data processing can reduce that burden. In Barclays’ case, these efficiencies are part of the bank’s rationale for setting higher performance targets, even though margins remain under pressure in parts of its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to be specific about what these efficiencies mean in practice. AI technologies, for example, models that assist with risk analysis, customer service workflows, and internal reporting, can reduce the hours staff spend on manual work. That doesn’t always mean cutting jobs outright, but it can lower the overall cost base, especially in functions that are routine or transaction-driven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-investment-to-impact"&gt;From investment to impact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investments in AI don’t translate to results overnight. Barclays’ approach combines these tools with structural cost reduction programs, helping the bank manage expenses at a time when revenue growth alone isn’t enough to lift returns to desired levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays’ performance targets for 2028 reflect this dual focus. The bank’s leadership has said that its plans include returning more than £15 billion to shareholders between 2026 and 2028, supported by improved efficiency and profit strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, companies talk about technology investment in vague terms. Barclays’ latest figures make the link between tech and profit more concrete: the 12 % profit rise was reported in the same breath as the role of technology in trimming costs. It’s not the only factor; improved market conditions and growth in the US also helped, but it’s clearly part of the narrative that management is presenting to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This emphasis on cost discipline and profit impact sets Barclays apart from firms that treat AI as a long-term bet or a future project. Here, AI is integrated into ongoing cost management and financial planning, giving the bank a plausible pathway to stronger returns in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-legacy-firms"&gt;What this means for legacy firms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays is far from unique in exploring AI for cost savings and efficiency. Other banks have also flagged technology investments as part of broader restructuring efforts. But what makes Barclays’ case noteworthy is the scale of the strategy and the way it is tied to measured performance targets, not just experimentation or small-scale pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional industries, especially ones as regulated as banking, adopting AI is harder than in tech startups. Firms must navigate compliance, risk, customer privacy, and legacy systems that weren’t designed for automation. Yet Barclays’ public comments suggest that the bank is now comfortable enough with these tools to anchor part of its financial forecast on them. That signals a degree of maturity in how the institution operationalises AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays isn’t simply building isolated AI projects; leadership is weaving technology into cost discipline, modernisation of systems, and long-term planning. That shift matters because it shows how legacy firms, even those with large, complex operations, can start to move beyond pilots and into business-wide use cases that affect the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other end-user companies evaluating AI investments, Barclays offers a working example: a large, regulated company can use technology to help hit cost and profitability targets, not just to explore new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Jose Marroquin)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Goldman Sachs tests autonomous AI agents for process-heavy work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

 &lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building.

A new company called Meridian has emerged from stealth with a more comprehensive IDE-based approach to agentic financial modeling — and plenty of funding to build it. On Wednesday, the company announced $17 million in seed funding at a $100 million post-money valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our goal is to make financial modeling and spreadsheets way more predictable and auditable,” CEO and co-founder John Ling told TechCrunch. “How can you take a process that traditionally might have taken several hours and condense it down into like 10 minutes?”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz and The General Partnership, with participation from QED Investors, FPV Ventures, and Liquidity Ventures. The company says it is currently working with teams at Decagon and OffDeal, and signed $5 million of contracts in December alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Excel agents have been a popular target for AI startups, due in part to the high cost of human-led financial analysis. But where previous Excel agents like Shortcut AI built agents into Excel, Meridian operates as a stand-alone workspace, more akin to Cursor. This allows the app to operate like an IDE, integrating data sources and other outside references that might otherwise create friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Based in New York, the Meridian team includes both alumni of AI firms like Scale AI and Anthropic as well as financial veterans from firms like Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Ling describes it, Meridian’s biggest challenge is the strict requirements of financial clients, which often clash with the non-deterministic nature of AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you go to 10 different software engineers at Google, and you want to add some new feature into an app, you’ll probably get like 10 completely different implementations. And that’s totally fine,” Ling says. “But if you go to 10 banking analysts at Goldman Sachs and you ask for 10 valuation models for a company, you would probably get 10 almost identical workbooks.”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our goal is to really remove the doubt layer right from the LLM process,” Ling says. “You know exactly how the logic flows, and all of these assumptions or whatever that go into the model, you can see exactly where they’re coming from.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260122_MeridianAi_Group_0047.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The fight to tame spreadsheets with AI isn’t over yet. A new company called Meridian has emerged from stealth with a more comprehensive IDE-based approach to agentic financial modeling — and plenty of funding to build it. On Wednesday, the company announced $17 million in seed funding at a $100 million post-money valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our goal is to make financial modeling and spreadsheets way more predictable and auditable,” CEO and co-founder John Ling told TechCrunch. “How can you take a process that traditionally might have taken several hours and condense it down into like 10 minutes?”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz and The General Partnership, with participation from QED Investors, FPV Ventures, and Liquidity Ventures. The company says it is currently working with teams at Decagon and OffDeal, and signed $5 million of contracts in December alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Excel agents have been a popular target for AI startups, due in part to the high cost of human-led financial analysis. But where previous Excel agents like Shortcut AI built agents into Excel, Meridian operates as a stand-alone workspace, more akin to Cursor. This allows the app to operate like an IDE, integrating data sources and other outside references that might otherwise create friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Based in New York, the Meridian team includes both alumni of AI firms like Scale AI and Anthropic as well as financial veterans from firms like Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Ling describes it, Meridian’s biggest challenge is the strict requirements of financial clients, which often clash with the non-deterministic nature of AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you go to 10 different software engineers at Google, and you want to add some new feature into an app, you’ll probably get like 10 completely different implementations. And that’s totally fine,” Ling says. “But if you go to 10 banking analysts at Goldman Sachs and you ask for 10 valuation models for a company, you would probably get 10 almost identical workbooks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday, he officially brought his new startup, Monaco, out of stealth. It was co-founded with his brother Brian Blond, who is also an ex-sales professional turned VC. (Brian is a partner at Human Capital and was formerly at Sutter Hill.) The brothers are joined by two other co-founders, Abishek Viswanathan (previously CPO at Apollo and Qualtrics), and Malay Desai (formerly SVP of engineering at Clari).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Monaco has raised a total of $35 million, between a $10 million seed and $25 million Series A round, Sam Blond tells TechCrunch. Both rounds were led by Founders Fund, with participation from Human Capital. The startup has been quietly testing its AI sales platform through a private beta for a while, but on Wednesday opened it up to a public beta.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The well-connected Blond brothers (Sam was previously head of sales at Brex), also attracted a bunch of big-name angels as backers: Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, Y Combinator chief Garry Tan, and Greenoaks Capital founder Neil Mehta. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So what attracted such a venerable list of investors? Monaco is entering the crowded field of AI sales tech with a twist. It isn’t just competing with SaaS-era tech via its AI-native alternative; it’s also supplying experienced human salespeople to be experts in the AI loop, monitoring and guiding the AI’s work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup is targeting young seed and Series A-level startups with a product suite that includes an AI-native customer relationship management (CRM) system and a built-from-scratch ZoomInfo-like database for finding prospects. Its AI agents can create and execute email outreach campaigns and draft follow-up emails all monitored by the human experts. It includes other features, too, like a meeting notetaker.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The product is intended to automate much of the sales grunt work. “We can replace full workflows with agents,” Blond says (pictured above, third from left, with brother Brian, pictured second from left). For instance, Monaco builds a database of prospects, identifies the exact people at a target company to pitch, and the sequence in which to target them. “We orchestrate and execute that sequence. We schedule a meeting,” Blond says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The human-in-the-loop salespeople help ensure that the AI isn’t hallucinating and train it to sell the product, and the actual customer meetings are done by the people. No avatars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That makes Monaco a rare AI sales startup that isn’t talking about human replacement. Instead, it’s making experienced salespeople available to companies too nascent to hire them directly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s this combination of the technology, but also the service,” Blond says. “Monaco does not have an agent pretending to be a sales rep trying to sell to the customer.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently, Monaco’s main competition is HubSpot, priced as it is to be more affordable for young companies than the big kahuna of the market, Salesforce. Blond declined to tell us what Monaco will charge, except to say that it’s a flat fee and currently discounted while the product remains in beta. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He’s also well aware that he’s in an exceptionally crowded market. Y Combinator alone has graduated hundreds of sales startups in the past couple of years, ranging from AI CRMs to niche AI tools. Then there’s startups like Attio, Clay, and Conversion, and the crop of so-called AI SDR (sales-development representative) tools — human-replacement agentic startups like 11x, Artisan, and 1mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On top of that, the incumbents, including Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, and ZoomInfo, are all offering their own AI and agentic tools. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blond points out that today’s top players were built in another era, and none of the upstarts are performing well enough to be a clear-cut winner.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There definitely is not the ‘Cursor for sales’,” he says, referring to the popular AI coding tool. “But there will be.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He obviously wants Monaco to be that winner. “In the broad category of sales technology, there’s a market leader right now. That market leader is Salesforce,” Blond says. “We are in the early innings of the next platform shift that will lead to a new market leader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, out of all the areas he could have entered after leaving Founders Fund, why duke it out among so much competition? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blond, speaking earnestly, says that having spent his entire career in sales, “As a non-technical founder, there’s really only one type of technology company that I’m qualified to be the founder of: a sales technology company.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He’s clearly having fun doing so. The company employs about 40 people and the office,&amp;nbsp;filled with fellow career salespeople, sports WWII-esque motivational posters on the wall with slogans like “Save Startups” and “Build the future with Monaco.” There’s even an office gong that rings out every time the AI lands a meeting with a prospect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Monaco-Founder-Photo.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;When Sam Blond left his job as a VC for Founders Fund a year ago — just 18 months after he started — he told the world that being a VC wasn’t for him and he was “going back to operating.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday, he officially brought his new startup, Monaco, out of stealth. It was co-founded with his brother Brian Blond, who is also an ex-sales professional turned VC. (Brian is a partner at Human Capital and was formerly at Sutter Hill.) The brothers are joined by two other co-founders, Abishek Viswanathan (previously CPO at Apollo and Qualtrics), and Malay Desai (formerly SVP of engineering at Clari).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Monaco has raised a total of $35 million, between a $10 million seed and $25 million Series A round, Sam Blond tells TechCrunch. Both rounds were led by Founders Fund, with participation from Human Capital. The startup has been quietly testing its AI sales platform through a private beta for a while, but on Wednesday opened it up to a public beta.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The well-connected Blond brothers (Sam was previously head of sales at Brex), also attracted a bunch of big-name angels as backers: Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, Y Combinator chief Garry Tan, and Greenoaks Capital founder Neil Mehta. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So what attracted such a venerable list of investors? Monaco is entering the crowded field of AI sales tech with a twist. It isn’t just competing with SaaS-era tech via its AI-native alternative; it’s also supplying experienced human salespeople to be experts in the AI loop, monitoring and guiding the AI’s work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup is targeting young seed and Series A-level startups with a product suite that includes an AI-native customer relationship management (CRM) system and a built-from-scratch ZoomInfo-like database for finding prospects. Its AI agents can create and execute email outreach campaigns and draft follow-up emails all monitored by the human experts. It includes other features, too, like a meeting notetaker.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The product is intended to automate much of the sales grunt work. “We can replace full workflows with agents,” Blond says (pictured above, third from left, with brother Brian, pictured second from left). For instance, Monaco builds a database of prospects, identifies the exact people at a target company to pitch, and the sequence in which to target them. “We orchestrate and execute that sequence. We schedule a meeting,” Blond says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The human-in-the-loop salespeople help ensure that the AI isn’t hallucinating and train it to sell the product, and the actual customer meetings are done by the people. No avatars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That makes Monaco a rare AI sales startup that isn’t talking about human replacement. Instead, it’s making experienced salespeople available to companies too nascent to hire them directly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s this combination of the technology, but also the service,” Blond says. “Monaco does not have an agent pretending to be a sales rep trying to sell to the customer.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently, Monaco’s main competition is HubSpot, priced as it is to be more affordable for young companies than the big kahuna of the market, Salesforce. Blond declined to tell us what Monaco will charge, except to say that it’s a flat fee and currently discounted while the product remains in beta. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He’s also well aware that he’s in an exceptionally crowded market.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neither xAI nor Elon Musk have publicly commented on the departures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While attrition is typical at startups, co-founder departures are far less so. More than half of xAI’s founding team has now left, and the fact that several employees followed within days has intensified scrutiny around the company’s stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Three of the departing staff members say they will be starting something new alongside other former xAI engineers, although no details are available about the new venture. Others hint at a desire for more autonomy and smaller teams to build frontier tech more rapidly, pointing to the anticipated surge in AI productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yuhuai (Tony) Wu, an xAI co-founder and reasoning lead, said in a post announcing his resignation: “It’s time for my next chapter. It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shayan Salehian, who worked on product infrastructure and model behavior post-training at xAI and previously worked at Twitter/X, said last week he was leaving to “start something new.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Valid Kazemi, who had a brief stint working on machine learning, posted Tuesday that he left a few weeks ago, adding: “IMO, all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it’s boring … So, I’m starting something new.” &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roland Gavrilescu, a former xAI engineer, left in November to start Nuraline, a company building “forward-deployed AI agents,” but posted again on Tuesday that he left the firm to build “something new with others that left xAI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The departures come at a moment of significant controversy for xAI. The company is facing regulatory scrutiny after Grok created nonconsensual explicit deepfakes of women and children that were disseminated on X — French authorities last week raided X offices as part of an investigation. The company is also moving toward a planned IPO later this year, after being legally acquired by SpaceX last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk is also facing personal controversy after files published by the Justice Department show extended conversations with convicted rapist and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The emails show Musk discussing a visit to Epstein’s island on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013. Epstein was first convicted of procuring a child for prostitution in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI maintains a headcount of over 1,000 employees, so the departures are unlikely to affect the company’s short-term capabilities. Still, the rapid pace of the recent departures has taken on a life of its own online, with users jokingly announcing they too are “leaving xAI” despite never having worked there — a sign of how quickly the narrative of a “mass exodus” has snowballed on Musk’s X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, co-founder exits are harder to dismiss as routine churn. As Musk continues to consolidate his AI ambitions, their departures raise broader questions about governance and long-term stability at xAI. In frontier AI, where talent is scarce, qualities like reputational gravity and mission clarity matter. The more pressing question may not be how many engineers have left, but whether xAI can maintain the institutional steadiness needed to compete with rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

After a long stretch on GitHub Copilot, Silver is now a corporate vice president at Microsoft’s CoreAI division, where she works on tools for deploying apps and agentic systems within enterprises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Her work is focused on the Foundry system inside Azure, which is designed as a unified AI portal for enterprises, giving her a close view of how companies are actually using these systems and where deployments end up falling short.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I spoke with Silver about the current capabilities of enterprise agents, and why she believes this is the biggest opportunity for startups since the public cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview was edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, your work focuses on Microsoft products for outside developers — often startups that aren’t otherwise focused on AI. How do you see AI impacting those companies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I see this as being a watershed moment for startups as profound as the move to the public cloud. If you think about it, the cloud had a huge impact for startups because it meant that they no longer needed to have the real estate space to host their racks, and they didn’t need to spend as much money on the capital infusion of getting the hardware to be hosted in their labs and things like that. Everything became cheaper. Now agentic AI is going to kind of continue to reduce the overall cost of software operations again, because many of the jobs involved in standing up a new venture — whether it’s support people, legal investigations — a lot of it can be done faster and cheaper with AI agents. I think that’s going to lead to more ventures and more startups launching. And then we’re going to see higher-valuation startups with fewer people at the helm. And I think that that’s an exciting world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does that look like in practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We are certainly seeing multistep agents becoming very broadly used across all different kinds of coding tasks, right? Just as an example, one thing developers have to do to maintain a codebase is stay current with the latest versions of the libraries that it has a dependency on. You might have a dependency on an older version of the dot-net runtime or the Java SDK. And we can have these agentic systems reason over your entire codebase and bring it up to date much more easily, with maybe a 70% or 80% reduction of the time it takes. And it really has to be a deployed multistep agent to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Live-site operations is another one — if you think of maintaining a website or a service and something goes wrong, there’s a thud in the night, and somebody has to be on call to get woken up to go respond to the incident. We still do have people on call 24/7, just in case the service goes down. But it used to be a really loathed job because you’d get woken up fairly often for these minor incidents. And we’ve now built a genetic system to successfully diagnose and in many cases fully mitigate issues that come up in these live site operations so that humans don’t have to be woken up in the middle of the night and groggily go to their terminals and try to diagnose what’s going on. And that also helps us dramatically reduce the average time it takes for an incident to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the other puzzles of this present moment is that agentic deployments haven’t happened quite as fast as we expected even six months ago. I’m curious why you think that is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If you think about the people who are building agents, what is preventing them from being successful, in many cases, it comes down to not really knowing what the purpose of the agent should be. There’s a culture change that has to happen in how people build these systems. What is the business use case that they are trying to solve for? What are they trying to achieve? You need to be very clear-eyed about what the definition of success is for this agent. And you need to think, what is the data that I’m giving to the agent so that it can reason over how to go accomplish this particular task?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We see those things as the bigger stumbling blocks, more than the general uncertainty of letting agents get deployed. Anybody who goes and looks at these systems sees the return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mention the general uncertainty, which I think feels like a big blocker from the outside. Why do you see it as less of a problem in practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First of all, I think that it’s going to be very common that agentic systems have human-in-the-loop scenarios. Think about something like a package return. It used to be that you would have a workflow for the return processing that was 90% automated and 10% human intervention, where somebody would have to go look at the package and have to make a judgment call as to how damaged the package was before they would decide to accept the return.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s a perfect example where actually now the computer vision models are getting so good that in many cases, we don’t need to have as much human oversight over inspecting the package and making that determination. There will still be some cases that are borderline, where maybe the computer vision is not yet good enough to make a call, and maybe there’s an escalation. It’s kind of like, how often do you need to call in the manager?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are some things that will always need some kind of human oversight, because they’re such critical operations. Think about incurring a contractual legal obligation, or deploying code into a production codebase that could potentially affect the reliability of your systems. But even then, there’s the question of how far we could get in automating the rest of the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Amanda.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;For 24 years, Microsoft’s Amanda Silver has been working to help developers — and in the last few years, that’s meant building tools for AI.

The platform’s new “Dear Algo” feature lets users tell Threads what they temporarily want to see more or less of in their feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To use the feature, users need to type “Dear Algo” in a public Threads post, followed by what they’d like to see more or less of. For example, if you want to see more content about popular podcasts, you can post “Dear algo, show me more posts about podcasts.” Your feed will be adjusted for three days after submitting a request.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s worth noting that because Dear Algo works through public postings, others are able to see your request, and they can even repost your request to apply it to their own feed. This aspect of the feature may be a hindrance for some users, as they might not want their requests to be public. However, Meta says it views this as a way for users to discover new conversations and topics, turning personalization into a community experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3091671" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By allowing users to temporarily influence what appears on their feeds, Threads gains an edge over its competitors by offering a feature that isn’t available on rival platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Threads is where you go to keep up with what’s happening right now,” the company wrote in a blog post. “But sometimes, what matters to you changes in an instant, and you want your Threads feed to reflect that — whether it’s seeing more posts during a live NBA game or less about a TV show you haven’t caught up on yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Threads and its competitors, X and Bluesky, already offer users a simple way to indicate their preferences with a ‘Not Interested’ button, the new Dear Algo feature takes personalization a step further. The feature could also help make Threads feel more real-time, something X has historically been known for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Dear Algo is available now in the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, and the U.K. Threads plans to introduce it in more countries in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

Elon Musk and his coterie have been talking about AI in space for years—mainly in the context of Iain Banks’ science fiction series about a far-future universe where sentient spaceships roam and control the galaxy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, Musk sees an opportunity to realize a version of this vision. His company SpaceX has requested regulatory permission to build solar-powered orbital data centers, distributed across as many as a million satellites, that could shift as much as 100 GW of compute power off the planet.&amp;nbsp;He has reportedly suggested some of his AI satellites will be built on the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“By far the cheapest place to put AI will be space in 36 months or less,” Musk said last week on a podcast hosted by Stripe cofounder John Collison.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He’s not alone. xAI’s head of compute has reportedly bet his counterpart at Anthropic that 1% of global compute will be in orbit by 2028. Google (which has a significant ownership stake in SpaceX) has announced a space AI effort called Project Suncatcher, which will launch prototype vehicles in 2027. Starcloud, a start-up that has raised $34 million backed by Google and Andreessen Horowitz, filed its own plans for an 80,000 satellite constellation last week.&amp;nbsp;Even Jeff Bezos has said this is the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But behind the hype, what will it actually take to get data centers into space?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a first analysis, today’s terrestrial data centers remain cheaper than those in orbit. Andrew McCalip, a space engineer, has built a helpful calculator comparing the two models. His baseline results show that a 1 Gw orbital data center might cost $42.4B—almost three times its ground-bound equivalent, thanks to the up-front costs of building the satellites and launching them to orbit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Changing that equation, experts say, will require technology development across several fields, massive capital expenditure, and a lot of work on the supply chain for space-grade components. It also depends on costs on the ground rising as resources and supply chains are strained by growing demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-designing-and-launching-the-satellites"&gt;Designing and launching the satellites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The key driver for any space business model is how much it costs to get anything up there. Musk’s SpaceX is already pushing down on the cost of getting to orbit, but analysts looking at what it will take to make orbital data centers a reality need even lower prices to close their business case. In other words, while AI data centers may seem to be a story about a new business line ahead of the SpaceX IPO, the plan depends on completing the company’s longest-running unfinished project—Starship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Consider that the reusable Falcon 9 delivers, today, a cost to orbit of roughly $3,600/kg. Making space data centers doable, per Project Suncatcher’s white paper, will require prices closer to $200/kg, an 18-fold improvement which it expects to be available in the 2030s. At that price, however, the energy delivered by a Starlink satellite today would be cost competitive with a terrestrial datacenter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The expectation is that SpaceX’s next-generation Starship rocket will deliver those improvements—no other vehicle in development promises equivalent savings. However, that vehicle has yet to become operational or even reach orbit; a third iteration of Starship is expected to make its maiden launch sometime in the months ahead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even if Starship is completely successful, however, assumptions that it will immediately deliver lower prices to customers may not pass the smell test. Economists at the consultancy Rational Futures make a compelling case that, as with the Falcon 9, SpaceX will not want to charge much less than its best competitor—otherwise the company is leaving money on the table. If Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, for example, retails at $70 million, SpaceX won’t take on Starship missions for external customers at much less than that, which would leave it above the numbers publicly assumed by space data center builders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There are not enough rockets to launch a million satellites yet, so we’re pretty far from that,” Matt Gorman, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, said at a recent event. “If you think about the cost of getting a payload in space today, it’s massive. It is just not economical.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, if launch is the bane of all space businesses, the second challenge is production cost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We always take for granted, at this point, that Starship’s cost is going to be hundreds of dollars per kilo,” McCalip told TechCrunch. “People are not taking into account the satellites are almost $1,000 a kilo right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Satellite manufacturing costs are the largest chunk of that price tag, but if high-powered satellites can be made at about half the cost of current Starlink satellites, the numbers start to make sense. SpaceX has made great advances in satellite economics while building Starlink, its record-setting communications network, and the company hopes to achieve more through scale. Part of the reasoning behind a million satellites is undoubtedly the cost savings that come from mass production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the satellites that will be used for these missions must be large enough to satisfy the complex requirements for operating powerful GPUs, including large solar arrays, thermal management systems, and laser-based communications links to receive and deliver data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A 2025 white paper from Project Suncatcher offers one way to compare terrestrial and space data centers by the cost of power, the basic input needed to run chips. On the ground, data centers spend roughly $570–3,000 for a Kw of power over a year, depend on local power costs and the efficiency of their systems. SpaceX’s Starlink satellites get their power from on-board solar panels instead, but the cost of acquiring, launching, and maintaining those spacecraft delivers energy at $14,700 per Kw over a year. Put simply, satellites and their components will have to get a lot cheaper before they’re cost-competitive with metered power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-space-environment-is-not-fooling-around"&gt;The space environment is not fooling around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Orbital data center proponents often say that thermal management is “free” in space, but that’s an oversimplification. Without an atmosphere, it’s actually more difficult to disperse heat.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You’re relying on very large radiators to just be able to dissipate that heat into the blackness of space, and so that’s a lot of surface area and mass that you have to manage,” said Mike Safyan, an executive at Planet Labs, which is building prototype satellites for Google Suncatcher that are expected to launch in 2027. “It is recognized as one of the key challenges, especially long term.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Besides the vacuum of space, AI satellites will need to deal with cosmic radiation as well. Cosmic rays degrade chips over time, and they can also cause “bit flip” errors that can corrupt data. Chips can be protected with shielding, use rad-hardened components, or work in series with redundant error checks, but all these options involve expensive trades for mass. Still, Google used a particle beam to test the effects of radiation on its Tensor Processing Units (chips designed explicitly for machine learning applications). SpaceX executives said on social media that the company has acquired a particle accelerator for just that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another challenge comes from the solar panels themselves. The logic of the project is energy arbitrage: Putting solar panels in space makes them anywhere from five to eight times more efficient than on Earth, and if they’re in the right orbit, they can be in sight of the sun for 90% of the day or more, increasing their efficiency. Electricity is the main fuel for chips, so more energy = cheaper data centers. But even solar panels are more complicated in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Space-rated solar panels made of rare earth elements are hardy, but too expensive. Solar panels made from silicon are cheap and increasingly prevalent in space—Starlink and Amazon Kuiper use them—but they degrade much faster due to space radiation. That will limit the lifetime of AI satellites to around five years, which means they will have to generate return on investment faster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, some analysts think that’s not such a big deal, based on how quickly new generations of chips arrive on the scene. “After five or six years, the dollars per kilowatt hour doesn’t produce a return, and that’s because they’re not state of the art,” Philip Johnston, the CEO of Starcloud, told TechCrunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Danny Field, an executive at Solestial, a start-up building space-rated silicon solar panels, says the industry sees orbital data centers as a key driver of growth. He’s speaking with several companies about potential data center projects, and says “any player who is big enough to dream is at least thinking about it.” As a long-time spacecraft design engineer, however, he doesn’t discount the challenges in these models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You can always extrapolate physics out to a bigger size,” Field said. “I’m excited to see how some of these companies get to a point where the economics make sense and the business case closes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-space-data-centers-fit-in"&gt;How do space data centers fit in?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One outstanding question about these data centers: What will we do with them? Are they general purpose, or for inference, or for training? Based on existing use cases, they may not be entirely interchangeable with data centers on the ground.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A key challenge for training new models is operating thousands of GPUs together &lt;em&gt;en masse. &lt;/em&gt;Most model training is not distributed, but done in individual data centers. The hyperscalers are working to change this in order to increase the power of their models, but it still hasn’t been achieved. Similarly, training in space will require coherence between GPUs on multiple satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The team at Google’s Project Suncatcher notes that the company’s terrestrial data centers connect their TPU networks with throughput in the hundreds of gigabpits per second. The fastest off-the-shelf inter-satellite comms links today, which use lasers, can only get up to about 100 Gbps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That led to an intriguing architecture for Suncatcher: It involves flying 81 satellites in formation so they are close enough to use the kind of transceivers relied on by terrestrial data centers. That, of course, presents its own challenges: The autonomy required to ensure each spacecraft remains in its correct station, even if maneuvers are required to avoid orbital debris or another spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the Google study offers a caveat: The work of inference can tolerate the orbital radiation environment, but more research is needed to understand the potential impact of bit-flips and other errors on training workloads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Inference tasks don’t have the same need for thousands of GPUs working in unison. The job can be done with dozens of GPUs, perhaps on a single satellite, an architecture that represents a kind of minimum viable product and the likely starting point for the orbital data center business.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Training is not the ideal thing to do in space,” Johnston said. “I think almost all inference workloads will be done in space,” imagining everything from customer service voice agents to ChatGPT queries being computed in orbit. He says his company’s first AI satellite is already earning revenue performing inference in orbit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While details are scarce even in the company’s FCC filing, SpaceX’s orbital data center constellation seems to anticipate about 100 kw of compute power per ton28, roughly twice the power of current Starlink satellites. The spacecraft will operate in connection with each other and using the Starlink network to share information; the filing claims that Starlink’s laser links can achieve petabit-level throughput.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For SpaceX, the company’s recent acquisition of xAI (which is building its own terrestrial data centers) will let the company stake out positions in both terrestrial and orbital data centers, seeing which supply chain adapts faster.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s the benefit of having fungible Floating Point Operations Per Second – if you can make it work. “A FLOP is a FLOP, it doesn’t matter where it lives,” McCalip said. “[SpaceX] can just scale until [it] hits permitting or capex bottlenecks on the ground, and then fall back to [their] space deployments.”&lt;/p&gt;

Elon Musk and his coterie have been talking about AI in space for years—mainly in the context of Iain Banks’ science fiction series about a far-future universe where sentient spaceships roam and control the galaxy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, Musk sees an opportunity to realize a version of this vision. His company SpaceX has requested regulatory permission to build solar-powered orbital data centers, distributed across as many as a million satellites, that could shift as much as 100 GW of compute power off the planet.&amp;nbsp;He has reportedly suggested some of his AI satellites will be built on the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“By far the cheapest place to put AI will be space in 36 months or less,” Musk said last week on a podcast hosted by Stripe cofounder John Collison.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He’s not alone. xAI’s head of compute has reportedly bet his counterpart at Anthropic that 1% of global compute will be in orbit by 2028. Google (which has a significant ownership stake in SpaceX) has announced a space AI effort called Project Suncatcher, which will launch prototype vehicles in 2027. Starcloud, a start-up that has raised $34 million backed by Google and Andreessen Horowitz, filed its own plans for an 80,000 satellite constellation last week.&amp;nbsp;Even Jeff Bezos has said this is the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But behind the hype, what will it actually take to get data centers into space?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a first analysis, today’s terrestrial data centers remain cheaper than those in orbit. Andrew McCalip, a space engineer, has built a helpful calculator comparing the two models. His baseline results show that a 1 Gw orbital data center might cost $42.4B—almost three times its ground-bound equivalent, thanks to the up-front costs of building the satellites and launching them to orbit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Changing that equation, experts say, will require technology development across several fields, massive capital expenditure, and a lot of work on the supply chain for space-grade components. It also depends on costs on the ground rising as resources and supply chains are strained by growing demand.&lt;/p&gt;
