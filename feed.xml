As the director of operations at Dream Luxury Rental, he outfits customers in the Detroit area looking to ride in style to a wedding, a graduation, or any other event with high-end vehicles—Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis, Bentleys, Mercedes G-Wagons, and more.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But before he could rent out the Rolls, Zahr needed to get the car to Detroit from Miami, where he bought it from a used-car dealer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His team posted the convertible on Central Dispatch, an online marketplace that’s popular among car dealers, manufacturers, and owners who want to arrange vehicle shipments. It’s not too complicated, at least in theory: A typical listing includes the type of vehicle, zip codes of the origin and destination, dates for pickup and delivery, and the fee. Anyone with a Central Dispatch account can see the job, and an individual carrier or transport broker who wants it can call the number on the listing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zahr’s team got a call from a transport company that wanted the job. They agreed on the price and scheduled pickup for January 17, 2025. Zahr watched from a few feet away as the car was loaded into an enclosed trailer. He expected the vehicle to arrive in Detroit just a few days later—by January 21.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it never showed up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zahr called a contact at the transport company to ask what happened.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“He’s like, &lt;em&gt;I don’t know what you’re talking about&lt;/em&gt;.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zahr told me his contact angrily told him they mostly ship Coca-Cola products, not luxury cars. “He was yelling and screaming about it,” Zahr said.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Over the years, people have broken into his business to steal cars, or they’ve rented them out and never come back. But until this day, he’d never had a car simply disappear during shipping. He’d expected no trouble this time around, especially since he’d used Central Dispatch—“a legit platform that everyone uses to transport cars,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“That’s the scary part about it, you know?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wreaking havoc&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zahr had unwittingly been caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft. Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination and then use a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school chop shop techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These vehicles can be retitled and resold in the US or loaded into a shipping container and sent to an overseas buyer. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless,” says Steven Yariv, the CEO of Dealers Choice Auto Transport of West Palm Beach, Florida, one of the country’s largest luxury-vehicle transport brokers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Individual cases have received media coverage thanks to the high value of the stolen cars and the fact that some belong to professional athletes and other celebrities. In late 2024, a Lamborghini Huracán belonging to Colorado Rockies third baseman Kris Bryant went missing en route to his home in Las Vegas; R&amp;amp;B singer Ray J told TMZ the same year that two Mercedes Maybachs never arrived in New York as planned; and last fall, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal had a $180,000 custom Range Rover stolen when the transport company hired to move the vehicle was hacked. “They’re saying they think it’s probably in Dubai by now, to be honest,” an employee of the company that customized the SUV told Shaq in a YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Steven Yariv, CEO, Dealers Choice Auto Transport of West Palm Beach, Florida&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1132656" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/MITReview-spo1.jpg?w=2975" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;RICHARD CHANCE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s challenging to quantify the scale of this type of crime, since there isn’t a single entity or association that tracks it. Still, these law enforcement officials and brokers, as well as the country’s biggest online car-transport marketplaces, acknowledge that fraud and theft are on the rise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I spoke with him in August, Yariv estimated that around 8,000 exotic and high-end cars had been stolen since the spring of 2024, resulting in over $1&amp;nbsp;billion in losses. “You’re talking 30 cars a day [on] average is gone,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Multiple state and local law enforcement officials told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that the number is plausible. (The FBI did not respond to a request for an interview.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t surprise me,” said J.D. Decker, chief of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles’ police division and chair of the fraud subcommittee for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. “It’s a huge business.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), a nonprofit that works with law enforcement and the insurance industry to investigate insurance fraud and related crimes, provides further evidence of this crime wave. NICB tracks both car theft and cargo theft, a broad category that refers to goods, money, or baggage that is stolen while part of a commercial shipment; the category also covers cases in which a vehicle is stolen via a diverted transport truck or a purloined car is loaded into a shipping container. NICB’s statistics about car theft show that it has declined following an increase during the pandemic—but over the same period cargo theft has dramatically increased, to an estimated $35&amp;nbsp;billion annually. The group projected in June that it was expected to rise 22% in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NICB doesn’t break out data for vehicles as opposed to other types of stolen cargo. But Bill Woolf, a regional director for the organization, said an antifraud initiative at the Port of Baltimore experienced a 200% increase from 2023 to 2024 in the number of stolen vehicles recovered. He said the jump could be due to the increased effort to identify stolen cars moving through the port, but he noted that earlier the day we spoke, agents had recovered two high-end stolen vehicles bound for overseas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“One day, one container—a million dollars,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Many other vehicles are never recovered—perhaps a result of the speed with which they’re shipped off or sold. Travis Payne, an exotic-car dealer in Atlanta, told me that transport thieves often have buyers lined up before they take a car: “When they steal them, they have a plan.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2024, Payne spent months trying to locate a Rolls-Royce he’d purchased after it was stolen via transport fraud. It eventually turned up in the Instagram feed of a Mexican pop star, he says. He never got the car back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The criminals are “gonna keep doing it,” he says, “because they make a couple phone calls, make a couple email accounts, and they get a $400,000 car for free. I mean, it makes them God, you know?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Out-innovating the industry&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The explosion of vehicle transport fraud follows a pattern that has played out across the economy over the past roughly two decades: A business that once ran on phones, faxes, and personal relationships shifted to online marketplaces that increased efficiency and brought down costs—but the reduction in human-to-human interaction introduced security vulnerabilities that allowed organized and often international fraudsters to enter the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the case of vehicle transport, the marketplaces are online “load boards” where car owners, dealerships, and manufacturers post about vehicles that need to be shipped from one location to another. Central Dispatch claims to be the largest vehicle load board and says on its website that thousands of vehicles are posted on its platform each day. It’s part of Cox Automotive, an industry juggernaut that owns major vehicle auctions, Autotrader, Kelley Blue Book, and other businesses that work with auto dealers, lenders, and buyers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The system worked pretty well until roughly two years ago, when organized fraud rings began compromising broker and carrier accounts and exploiting loopholes in government licensing to steal loads with surprising ease and alarming frequency.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;A theft can start with a phishing email that appears to come from a legitimate load board. The recipient, a broker or carrier, clicks a link in the message, which appears to go to the real site—but logging in sends the victim’s username and password to a criminal. The crook logs in as the victim, changes the account’s email and phone number to reroute all communications, and begins claiming loads of high-end vehicles. Cox Automotive declined an interview request but said in a statement that the “load board system still works well” and that “fraud impacts a very small portion” of listings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Bill Woolf, a regional director, National Insurance Crime Bureau&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Criminals also gain access to online marketplaces by exploiting a lax regulatory environment. While a valid US Department of Transportation registration is required to access online marketplaces, it’s not hard for bad actors to register sham transport companies and obtain a USDOT number from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the agency that regulates commercial motor vehicles. In other cases, criminals compromise the FMCSA accounts of legitimate companies and change their phone numbers and email addresses in order to impersonate them and steal loads. (USDOT did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As Bek Abdullayev, the founder of Super Dispatch, one of Central Dispatch’s biggest competitors, explained in an episode of the podcast &lt;em&gt;Auto Transport Co-Pilot&lt;/em&gt;, “FMCSA [is] authorizing people that are fraudulent companies—people that are not who they say they are.” He added that people can “game the system and … obtain paperwork that makes [them] look like a legitimate company.” For example, vehicle carrier insurance can be obtained quickly—if temporarily—by submitting an online application with fraudulent payment credentials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that crooks have found myriad ways to present themselves as genuine and permitted vehicle transport brokers and carriers. Once hired to move a vehicle, they often repost the car on a load board using a different fraudulent or compromised account. While this kind of subcontracting, known as “double-­brokering,” is sometimes used by companies to save money, it can also be used by criminals to hire an unwitting accomplice to deliver the stolen car to their desired location. “They’re booking cars and then they’re just reposting them and dispatching them out to different routes,” says Yariv, the West Palm Beach transport broker.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A lot of this is cartel operated,” says Decker, of the Nevada DMV, who also serves on a vehicle fraud committee for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “There’s so much money in it that it rivals selling drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even though this problem is becoming increasingly well known, fraudsters continue to steal, largely with impunity. Brokers, auto industry insiders, and law enforcement told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that load boards and the USDOT have been too slow to catch and ban bad actors. (In its statement, Cox Automotive said it has been “dedicated to continually enhancing our processes, technology, and education efforts across the industry to fight fraud.”)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jake MacDonald, who leads Super Dispatch’s fraud monitoring and investigation efforts, put it bluntly on the podcast with Abdullayev: the reason that fraud is “jumping so much” is that “the industry is slowly moving over to a more technologically advanced position, but it’s so slow that fraud is actually [out-]innovating the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Florida sting&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the person Zahr’s team hired on Central Dispatch didn’t really work for the transport company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After securing the job, the fraudster reposted the orange-and-gray Rolls convertible to a load board. And instead of saying that the car needed to go from Miami to the real destination of Detroit, the new job listed an end point of Hallandale Beach, Florida, just 20 or so miles away. It was a classic case of malicious double-­brokering: the crooks claimed a load and then reposted it in order to find a new, unsuspecting driver to deliver the car into their possession.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On January 17 of last year, the legitimate driver showed up in a Dodge Ram and loaded the Rolls into an enclosed trailer as Zahr watched.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The guy came in and looked very professional, and we took a video of him loading the car, taking pictures of everything,” Zahr told me. He never thought to double-­check where the driver was headed or which company he worked for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not long after a panicked Zahr spoke with his contact at the transport company he thought he was working with, he reported the car as stolen to the Miami police. Detective Ryan Chin was assigned to the case. It fit with a pattern of high-end auto theft that he and his colleagues had recently been tracking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Over the past few weeks, detectives have been made aware of a new method on the rise for vehicles being stolen by utilizing Central Dispatch,” Chin wrote in records obtained by &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. “Specific brokers are re-routing the truck drivers upon them picking up vehicles posted for transport and routing them to other locations provided by the broker.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chin used Zahr’s photos and video to identify the truck and driver who’d taken the Rolls. By the time police found him, on January 31, the driver had already dropped off Zahr’s Rolls in Hallandale Beach. He’d also picked up and delivered a black Lamborghini Urus and a White Audi R8 for the same client. Each car had been stolen via double-brokering transport fraud, according to court records.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The police department declined to comment or to make Chin available for an interview. But a source with knowledge of the case said the driver was “super cooperative.” (The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, and the driver does not appear to have been identified in court records.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The driver told police that he had another load to pick up at a dealership in Naples, Florida, later that same day—a second Lamborghini Urus, this one orange. Police later discovered it was supposed to be shipped to California. But the carrier had been hired to bring the car, which retails for about $250,000, to a mall in nearby Aventura. He told police that he suspected it was going to be delivered to the same person who had booked him for the earlier Rolls, Audi, and Lamborghini deliveries, since “the voice sounds consistent with who [the driver] dealt with prior on the phone.” This drop-off was slated for 4 p.m. at the Waterways Shoppes mall in Aventura.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was when Chin and a fellow detective, Orlando Rodriguez, decided to set up a sting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The officers and colleagues across three law enforcement agencies quickly positioned themselves in the Waterways parking lot ahead of the scheduled delivery of the Urus. They watched as, pretty much right on schedule that afternoon, the cooperative driver of the Dodge Ram rolled to a stop in the palm-tree-lined lot, which was surrounded by a kosher supermarket, Japanese and Middle Eastern restaurants, and a physiotherapy clinic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The driver went inside the trailer and emerged in the orange Lamborghini. He parked it and waited near the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Roughly 30 minutes later, a green Rolls-Royce Cullinan (price: $400,000 and up) arrived with two men and a teenager inside. They got out, opened the trunk, and sat on the tailgate of the vehicle as one man counted cash.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“They’re doing countersurveillance, looking around,” the source told me later. “It’s a little out of the ordinary, you know. They kept being fixated [on] where the truck was parked.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The transport driver and the three males who arrived in the Rolls-Royce did not interact. But soon enough, another luxury vehicle, a Bentley Continental GT, which last year retailed for about $250,000 and up, pulled in. The Bentley driver got out, took the cash from one of the men sitting on the back of the Rolls, and walked over to the transport driver. He handed him $700 and took the keys to the Lamborghini.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s when more than a dozen officers swooped in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“They had nowhere to go,” the source told me. “We surrounded them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The two men in the Rolls were later identified as Arman Gevorgyan and Hrant Nazarian, and the man in the Bentley as Yuriy Korotovskyy. The three were arrested and charged with dealing in stolen property, grand theft over $100,000, and organized fraud. (The teenager who arrived in the Rolls was Gevorgyan’s son. He was detained and released, according to Richard Cooper, Gevorgyan’s attorney.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As investigators dug into the case, the evidence suggested that this was part of the criminal pattern they’d been following. “I think it’s organized,” the source told me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s something that transport industry insiders have talked about for a while, according to Fred Mills, the owner of Florida-based Advantage Auto Transport, a company that specializes in transporting high-end vehicles. He said there’s even a slang term to describe people engaged in transport fraud: the flip-flop mafia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cst-block "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It has multiple meanings. One is that the people who show up to transport or accept a vehicle “are out there wearing, you know, flip-flops and slides,” Mills says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second refers to how fraudsters “flip” from one carrier registration to another as they try to stay ahead of regulators and complaints.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to needing a USDOT number, carriers working across states need an interstate operating authority (commonly known as an MC number) from the USDOT. Both IDs are typically printed on the driver and passenger doors. But the rise of ­double-brokering—and of fly-by-night and fraudulent carriers—means that drivers increasingly just tape IDs to their door.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_35"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mills says fraudsters will use a USDOT number for 10 or 11 months, racking up violations, and then tape up a new one. “They just wash, rinse, and repeat,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Decker from the Nevada DMV says a lot of high-end vehicles are stolen because dealerships and individual customers don’t properly check the paperwork or identity of the person who shows up to transport them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“‘Flip-flop mafia’ is an apt nickname because it’s surprisingly easy to get a car on a truck and convince somebody that they’re a legitimate transport operation when they’re not,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Roughly a month after it disappeared, Zahr’s Rolls-Royce was recovered by the Miami Beach Police. Video footage obtained by a local TV station showed the gray car with its distinctive orange top being towed into a police garage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What happens in Vegas&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Among the items confiscated from the men in Florida were $10,796 in cash and a GPS jammer. Law enforcement sources say jammers have become a core piece of technology for modern car thieves—necessary to disable the location tracking provided by GPS navigation systems in most cars. “Once they get the vehicles, they usually park them somewhere [and] put a signal jammer in there or cut out the GPS,” the Florida source told me. This buys them time to swap and reprogram the vehicle identification number (VIN), wipe car computers, and reprogram fobs to remove traces of the car’s provenance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No two VINs are the same, and each is assigned to a specific vehicle by the manufacturer. Where they’re placed inside a vehicle varies by make and model. The NICB’s Woolf says cars also have confidential VINs located in places—including their electronic components—that are supposed to be known only to law enforcement and his organization. But criminals have figured out how to find and change them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_37"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s making it more and more difficult for us to identify vehicles as stolen,” Woolf says. “Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All this doesn’t even take very much time. “If you know what you’re doing, and you steal the car at one o’clock today, you can have it completely done at two o’clock today,” says Woolf. A vehicle can be rerouted, reprogrammed, re-VINed, and sometimes even retitled before an owner files a police report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_40"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That appears to have been the plan in the case of the stolen light-gray 2023 Lamborghini Huracán owned by the Rockies’ Kris Bryant.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On September 29, 2024, a carrier hired via a load board arrived at Bryant’s home in Cherry Hills, Colorado, to pick up the car. It was supposed to be transported to Bryant’s Las Vegas residence within a few days. It never showed up there—but it was in fact in Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using Flock traffic cameras, which capture license plate information in areas across the country, Detective Justin Smith of the Cherry Hills Village Police Department tracked the truck and trailer that had picked up the Lambo to Nevada, and he alerted local police.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On October 7, a Las Vegas officer spotted a car matching the Lamborghini’s description and pulled it over. The driver said the Huracán had been brought to his auto shop by a man whom the police were able to identify as Dat Viet Tieu. They arrested Tieu later that same day. In an interview with police, he identified himself as a car broker. He said he was going to resell the Lamborghini and that he had no idea that the car was stolen, according to the arrest report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Police searched a Jeep Wrangler that Tieu had parked nearby and discovered it had been stolen—and had been re-VINed, retitled, and registered to his wife. Inside the car, police discovered “multiple fraudulent VIN stickers, key fobs to other high-end stolen vehicles, and fictitious placards,” their report said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the fake VINs matched the make and model of Bryant’s Lamborghini. (Representatives for Bryant and the Rockies did not respond to a request for comment.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tieu was released on bail. But after he returned to LVPD headquarters two days later, on October 9, to reclaim his personal property, officers secretly placed him under surveillance with the hope that he’d lead them to one of the other stolen cars matching the key fobs they’d found in the Jeep.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for them to get lucky. A few hours after leaving the police station, Tieu drove to Harry Reid International Airport, where he picked up an unidentified man. They drove to the Caesars Palace parking garage and pulled in near a GMC Sierra. Over the next three hours, the man worked on a laptop inside and outside the vehicle, according to a police report. At one point, he and Tieu connected jumper cables from Tieu’s rented Toyota Camry to the Sierra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_43"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“At 2323 hours, the white male adult enters the GMC Sierra, and the vehicle’s ignition starts. It was readily apparent the [two men] had successfully re-programmed a key fob to the GMC Sierra,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An officer watched as the man gave two key fobs to Tieu, who handed the man an unknown amount of cash. Still, the police let the men leave the garage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The police kept Tieu and his wife under surveillance for more than a week. Then, on October 18, fearing the couple was about to leave town, officers entered Nora’s Italian Restaurant just off the Vegas Strip and took them into custody.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Obviously, we meet again,” a detective told Tieu.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’m not surprised,” Tieu replied.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Police later searched the VIN on the Sierra from the Caesars lot and found that it had been reported stolen in Tremonton, Utah, roughly two weeks earlier. They eventually returned both the Sierra and Kris Bryant’s Lamborghini to their owners.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tieu pleaded guilty to two felony counts of possession of a stolen vehicle and one count of defacing, altering, substituting, or removing a VIN. In October, he was sentenced to up to one year of probation; if it’s completed successfully, the plea agreement says, the counts of possession of a stolen vehicle will be dismissed. His attorneys, David Z. Chesnoff and Richard A. Schonfeld, said in a statement that they were “pleased” with the court’s decision, “in light of [Tieu’s] acceptance of responsibility.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Taking the heat&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many vehicles stolen via transport fraud are never recovered. Experts say the best way to stop this criminal cycle would be to disrupt it before it starts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_45"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That would require significant changes to the way that load boards operate. Bryant’s Lamborghini, Zahr’s and Payne’s Rolls-Royces, and the orange Lamborghini Urus in Florida were all posted for transport on Central Dispatch. Both brokers and shippers argue that the company hasn’t taken enough responsibility for what they characterize as weak oversight.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company … they have no liability in the whole transaction process. So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Fred Mills, owner of Florida-based Advantage Auto Transport&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You’re Cox Automotive—you’re the biggest car company in the world for dealers—and you’re not doing better screenings when you sign people up?” says Payne. (The spokesperson for Cox Automotive said that it has “a robust verification process for all clients … who sign up.”)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_47"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company, or the clients’ insurance, [which means] that they have no liability in the whole transaction process,” says Mills. “So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the last year, Central Dispatch has made changes to further secure its platform. It introduced two-factor authentication for user accounts and started enabling shippers to use its app to track loads in real time, among other measures. It also kicked off an awareness campaign that includes online educational content and media appearances to communicate that the company takes its responsibilities seriously.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’ve removed over 500 accounts already in 2025, and we’ll continue to take any of that aggressive action where it’s needed,” said Lainey Sibble, Central Dispatch’s head of business, in a sponsored episode of the &lt;em&gt;Auto Remarketing Podcast&lt;/em&gt;. “We also recognize this is not going to happen in a silo. Everyone has a role to play here, and it’s really going to take us all working together in partnership to combat this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mills says Central Dispatch got faster at shutting down fraudulent accounts toward the end of last year. But it’s going to take time to fix the industry, he adds: “I compare it to a 15-year opioid addiction. It’s going to take a while to detox the system.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yariv, the broker in West Palm Beach, says he has stopped using Central Dispatch and other load boards altogether. “One person has access here, and that’s me. I don’t even log in,” he told me. His team has gone back to working the phones, as evidenced by the din of voices in the background as we spoke.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1132657" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/MITReview-spo2.jpg?w=2498" width="2498" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;RICHARD CHANCE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“[The fraud is] everywhere. It’s constant,” he said. “The only way it goes away is the dispatch boards have to be shut down—and that’ll never happen.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_49"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also remains to be seen what kind of accountability there will be for the alleged thieves in Florida. Korotovskyy and Nazarian pleaded not guilty; as of press time, their trials were scheduled to begin in May. (Korotovskyy’s lawyer, Bruce Prober, said in a statement that the case “is an ongoing matter” and his client is “presumed innocent,” while Nazarian’s attorney, Yale Sanford, said in a statement, “As the investigation continues, Mr. Nazarian firmly asserts his innocence.” A spokesperson with Florida’s Office of the State Attorney emailed a statement: “The circumstances related to these arrests are still a matter of investigation and prosecution. It would be inappropriate to be commenting further.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In contrast, Gevorgyan, the third man arrested in the Florida sting, pleaded guilty to four charges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet he maintains his innocence, according to Cooper, his lawyer: “He was pleading [guilty] to get out and go home.” Cooper describes his client as a wealthy Armenian national who runs a jewelry business back home, adding that he was deported to Armenia in September.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cooper says his client’s “sweetheart” plea deal doesn’t require him to testify or otherwise supply information against his alleged co-conspirators—or to reveal details about how all these luxury cars were mysteriously disappearing across South Florida. Cooper also says prosecutors may have a difficult time convicting the other two men, arguing that police acted prematurely by arresting the trio without first seeing what, if anything, they intended to do with the Lamborghini.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“All they ever had,” Cooper says, “was three schmucks sitting outside of the Lamborghini.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Craig Silverman is an award-winning journalist and the cofounder of &lt;/em&gt;Indicator&lt;em&gt;, a publication that reports on digital deception.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Sam Zahr first saw the gray Rolls-Royce Dawn convertible with orange interior and orange roof, he knew he’d found a perfect addition to his fleet. “It was very appealing to our clientele,” he told me. As the director of operations at Dream Luxury Rental, he outfits customers in the Detroit area looking to ride in style to a wedding, a graduation, or any other event with high-end vehicles—Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis, Bentleys, Mercedes G-Wagons, and more.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But before he could rent out the Rolls, Zahr needed to get the car to Detroit from Miami, where he bought it from a used-car dealer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His team posted the convertible on Central Dispatch, an online marketplace that’s popular among car dealers, manufacturers, and owners who want to arrange vehicle shipments. It’s not too complicated, at least in theory: A typical listing includes the type of vehicle, zip codes of the origin and destination, dates for pickup and delivery, and the fee. Anyone with a Central Dispatch account can see the job, and an individual carrier or transport broker who wants it can call the number on the listing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zahr’s team got a call from a transport company that wanted the job. They agreed on the price and scheduled pickup for January 17, 2025. Zahr watched from a few feet away as the car was loaded into an enclosed trailer. He expected the vehicle to arrive in Detroit just a few days later—by January 21.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it never showed up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zahr called a contact at the transport company to ask what happened.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“He’s like, &lt;em&gt;I don’t know what you’re talking about&lt;/em&gt;.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zahr told me his contact angrily told him they mostly ship Coca-Cola products, not luxury cars. “He was yelling and screaming about it,” Zahr said.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Over the years, people have broken into his business to steal cars, or they’ve rented them out and never come back. But until this day, he’d never had a car simply disappear during shipping. He’d expected no trouble this time around, especially since he’d used Central Dispatch—“a legit platform that everyone uses to transport cars,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“That’s the scary part about it, you know?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wreaking havoc&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zahr had unwittingly been caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft. Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination and then use a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school chop shop techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These vehicles can be retitled and resold in the US or loaded into a shipping container and sent to an overseas buyer. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless,” says Steven Yariv, the CEO of Dealers Choice Auto Transport of West Palm Beach, Florida, one of the country’s largest luxury-vehicle transport brokers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Individual cases have received media coverage thanks to the high value of the stolen cars and the fact that some belong to professional athletes and other celebrities. In late 2024, a Lamborghini Huracán belonging to Colorado Rockies third baseman Kris Bryant went missing en route to his home in Las Vegas; R&amp;amp;B singer Ray J told TMZ the same year that two Mercedes Maybachs never arrived in New York as planned; and last fall, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal had a $180,000 custom Range Rover stolen when the transport company hired to move the vehicle was hacked. “They’re saying they think it’s probably in Dubai by now, to be honest,” an employee of the company that customized the SUV told Shaq in a YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Steven Yariv, CEO, Dealers Choice Auto Transport of West Palm Beach, Florida&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1132656" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/MITReview-spo1.jpg?w=2975" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;RICHARD CHANCE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s challenging to quantify the scale of this type of crime, since there isn’t a single entity or association that tracks it. Still, these law enforcement officials and brokers, as well as the country’s biggest online car-transport marketplaces, acknowledge that fraud and theft are on the rise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I spoke with him in August, Yariv estimated that around 8,000 exotic and high-end cars had been stolen since the spring of 2024, resulting in over $1&amp;nbsp;billion in losses. “You’re talking 30 cars a day [on] average is gone,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Multiple state and local law enforcement officials told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that the number is plausible. (The FBI did not respond to a request for an interview.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t surprise me,” said J.D. Decker, chief of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles’ police division and chair of the fraud subcommittee for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. “It’s a huge business.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), a nonprofit that works with law enforcement and the insurance industry to investigate insurance fraud and related crimes, provides further evidence of this crime wave. NICB tracks both car theft and cargo theft, a broad category that refers to goods, money, or baggage that is stolen while part of a commercial shipment; the category also covers cases in which a vehicle is stolen via a diverted transport truck or a purloined car is loaded into a shipping container. NICB’s statistics about car theft show that it has declined following an increase during the pandemic—but over the same period cargo theft has dramatically increased, to an estimated $35&amp;nbsp;billion annually. The group projected in June that it was expected to rise 22% in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NICB doesn’t break out data for vehicles as opposed to other types of stolen cargo. But Bill Woolf, a regional director for the organization, said an antifraud initiative at the Port of Baltimore experienced a 200% increase from 2023 to 2024 in the number of stolen vehicles recovered. He said the jump could be due to the increased effort to identify stolen cars moving through the port, but he noted that earlier the day we spoke, agents had recovered two high-end stolen vehicles bound for overseas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“One day, one container—a million dollars,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Many other vehicles are never recovered—perhaps a result of the speed with which they’re shipped off or sold. Travis Payne, an exotic-car dealer in Atlanta, told me that transport thieves often have buyers lined up before they take a car: “When they steal them, they have a plan.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2024, Payne spent months trying to locate a Rolls-Royce he’d purchased after it was stolen via transport fraud. It eventually turned up in the Instagram feed of a Mexican pop star, he says. He never got the car back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The criminals are “gonna keep doing it,” he says, “because they make a couple phone calls, make a couple email accounts, and they get a $400,000 car for free. I mean, it makes them God, you know?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Out-innovating the industry&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The explosion of vehicle transport fraud follows a pattern that has played out across the economy over the past roughly two decades: A business that once ran on phones, faxes, and personal relationships shifted to online marketplaces that increased efficiency and brought down costs—but the reduction in human-to-human interaction introduced security vulnerabilities that allowed organized and often international fraudsters to enter the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the case of vehicle transport, the marketplaces are online “load boards” where car owners, dealerships, and manufacturers post about vehicles that need to be shipped from one location to another. Central Dispatch claims to be the largest vehicle load board and says on its website that thousands of vehicles are posted on its platform each day. It’s part of Cox Automotive, an industry juggernaut that owns major vehicle auctions, Autotrader, Kelley Blue Book, and other businesses that work with auto dealers, lenders, and buyers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The system worked pretty well until roughly two years ago, when organized fraud rings began compromising broker and carrier accounts and exploiting loopholes in government licensing to steal loads with surprising ease and alarming frequency.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;A theft can start with a phishing email that appears to come from a legitimate load board. The recipient, a broker or carrier, clicks a link in the message, which appears to go to the real site—but logging in sends the victim’s username and password to a criminal. The crook logs in as the victim, changes the account’s email and phone number to reroute all communications, and begins claiming loads of high-end vehicles. Cox Automotive declined an interview request but said in a statement that the “load board system still works well” and that “fraud impacts a very small portion” of listings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Bill Woolf, a regional director, National Insurance Crime Bureau&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Criminals also gain access to online marketplaces by exploiting a lax regulatory environment. While a valid US Department of Transportation registration is required to access online marketplaces, it’s not hard for bad actors to register sham transport companies and obtain a USDOT number from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the agency that regulates commercial motor vehicles. In other cases, criminals compromise the FMCSA accounts of legitimate companies and change their phone numbers and email addresses in order to impersonate them and steal loads. (USDOT did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As Bek Abdullayev, the founder of Super Dispatch, one of Central Dispatch’s biggest competitors, explained in an episode of the podcast &lt;em&gt;Auto Transport Co-Pilot&lt;/em&gt;, “FMCSA [is] authorizing people that are fraudulent companies—people that are not who they say they are.” He added that people can “game the system and … obtain paperwork that makes [them] look like a legitimate company.” For example, vehicle carrier insurance can be obtained quickly—if temporarily—by submitting an online application with fraudulent payment credentials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that crooks have found myriad ways to present themselves as genuine and permitted vehicle transport brokers and carriers. Once hired to move a vehicle, they often repost the car on a load board using a different fraudulent or compromised account. While this kind of subcontracting, known as “double-­brokering,” is sometimes used by companies to save money, it can also be used by criminals to hire an unwitting accomplice to deliver the stolen car to their desired location. “They’re booking cars and then they’re just reposting them and dispatching them out to different routes,” says Yariv, the West Palm Beach transport broker.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A lot of this is cartel operated,” says Decker, of the Nevada DMV, who also serves on a vehicle fraud committee for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “There’s so much money in it that it rivals selling drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even though this problem is becoming increasingly well known, fraudsters continue to steal, largely with impunity. Brokers, auto industry insiders, and law enforcement told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that load boards and the USDOT have been too slow to catch and ban bad actors. (In its statement, Cox Automotive said it has been “dedicated to continually enhancing our processes, technology, and education efforts across the industry to fight fraud.”)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jake MacDonald, who leads Super Dispatch’s fraud monitoring and investigation efforts, put it bluntly on the podcast with Abdullayev: the reason that fraud is “jumping so much” is that “the industry is slowly moving over to a more technologically advanced position, but it’s so slow that fraud is actually [out-]innovating the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Florida sting&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the person Zahr’s team hired on Central Dispatch didn’t really work for the transport company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After securing the job, the fraudster reposted the orange-and-gray Rolls convertible to a load board. And instead of saying that the car needed to go from Miami to the real destination of Detroit, the new job listed an end point of Hallandale Beach, Florida, just 20 or so miles away. It was a classic case of malicious double-­brokering: the crooks claimed a load and then reposted it in order to find a new, unsuspecting driver to deliver the car into their possession.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On January 17 of last year, the legitimate driver showed up in a Dodge Ram and loaded the Rolls into an enclosed trailer as Zahr watched.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The guy came in and looked very professional, and we took a video of him loading the car, taking pictures of everything,” Zahr told me. He never thought to double-­check where the driver was headed or which company he worked for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not long after a panicked Zahr spoke with his contact at the transport company he thought he was working with, he reported the car as stolen to the Miami police. Detective Ryan Chin was assigned to the case. It fit with a pattern of high-end auto theft that he and his colleagues had recently been tracking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Over the past few weeks, detectives have been made aware of a new method on the rise for vehicles being stolen by utilizing Central Dispatch,” Chin wrote in records obtained by &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. “Specific brokers are re-routing the truck drivers upon them picking up vehicles posted for transport and routing them to other locations provided by the broker.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chin used Zahr’s photos and video to identify the truck and driver who’d taken the Rolls. By the time police found him, on January 31, the driver had already dropped off Zahr’s Rolls in Hallandale Beach. He’d also picked up and delivered a black Lamborghini Urus and a White Audi R8 for the same client. Each car had been stolen via double-brokering transport fraud, according to court records.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The police department declined to comment or to make Chin available for an interview. But a source with knowledge of the case said the driver was “super cooperative.” (The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, and the driver does not appear to have been identified in court records.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The driver told police that he had another load to pick up at a dealership in Naples, Florida, later that same day—a second Lamborghini Urus, this one orange. Police later discovered it was supposed to be shipped to California. But the carrier had been hired to bring the car, which retails for about $250,000, to a mall in nearby Aventura. He told police that he suspected it was going to be delivered to the same person who had booked him for the earlier Rolls, Audi, and Lamborghini deliveries, since “the voice sounds consistent with who [the driver] dealt with prior on the phone.” This drop-off was slated for 4 p.m. at the Waterways Shoppes mall in Aventura.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was when Chin and a fellow detective, Orlando Rodriguez, decided to set up a sting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The officers and colleagues across three law enforcement agencies quickly positioned themselves in the Waterways parking lot ahead of the scheduled delivery of the Urus. They watched as, pretty much right on schedule that afternoon, the cooperative driver of the Dodge Ram rolled to a stop in the palm-tree-lined lot, which was surrounded by a kosher supermarket, Japanese and Middle Eastern restaurants, and a physiotherapy clinic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The driver went inside the trailer and emerged in the orange Lamborghini. He parked it and waited near the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Roughly 30 minutes later, a green Rolls-Royce Cullinan (price: $400,000 and up) arrived with two men and a teenager inside. They got out, opened the trunk, and sat on the tailgate of the vehicle as one man counted cash.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“They’re doing countersurveillance, looking around,” the source told me later. “It’s a little out of the ordinary, you know. They kept being fixated [on] where the truck was parked.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The transport driver and the three males who arrived in the Rolls-Royce did not interact. But soon enough, another luxury vehicle, a Bentley Continental GT, which last year retailed for about $250,000 and up, pulled in. The Bentley driver got out, took the cash from one of the men sitting on the back of the Rolls, and walked over to the transport driver. He handed him $700 and took the keys to the Lamborghini.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s when more than a dozen officers swooped in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“They had nowhere to go,” the source told me. “We surrounded them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The two men in the Rolls were later identified as Arman Gevorgyan and Hrant Nazarian, and the man in the Bentley as Yuriy Korotovskyy. The three were arrested and charged with dealing in stolen property, grand theft over $100,000, and organized fraud. (The teenager who arrived in the Rolls was Gevorgyan’s son. He was detained and released, according to Richard Cooper, Gevorgyan’s attorney.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As investigators dug into the case, the evidence suggested that this was part of the criminal pattern they’d been following. “I think it’s organized,” the source told me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s something that transport industry insiders have talked about for a while, according to Fred Mills, the owner of Florida-based Advantage Auto Transport, a company that specializes in transporting high-end vehicles. He said there’s even a slang term to describe people engaged in transport fraud: the flip-flop mafia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cst-block "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It has multiple meanings. One is that the people who show up to transport or accept a vehicle “are out there wearing, you know, flip-flops and slides,” Mills says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second refers to how fraudsters “flip” from one carrier registration to another as they try to stay ahead of regulators and complaints.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to needing a USDOT number, carriers working across states need an interstate operating authority (commonly known as an MC number) from the USDOT. Both IDs are typically printed on the driver and passenger doors. But the rise of ­double-brokering—and of fly-by-night and fraudulent carriers—means that drivers increasingly just tape IDs to their door.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_35"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mills says fraudsters will use a USDOT number for 10 or 11 months, racking up violations, and then tape up a new one. “They just wash, rinse, and repeat,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Decker from the Nevada DMV says a lot of high-end vehicles are stolen because dealerships and individual customers don’t properly check the paperwork or identity of the person who shows up to transport them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“‘Flip-flop mafia’ is an apt nickname because it’s surprisingly easy to get a car on a truck and convince somebody that they’re a legitimate transport operation when they’re not,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Roughly a month after it disappeared, Zahr’s Rolls-Royce was recovered by the Miami Beach Police. Video footage obtained by a local TV station showed the gray car with its distinctive orange top being towed into a police garage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What happens in Vegas&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Among the items confiscated from the men in Florida were $10,796 in cash and a GPS jammer. Law enforcement sources say jammers have become a core piece of technology for modern car thieves—necessary to disable the location tracking provided by GPS navigation systems in most cars. “Once they get the vehicles, they usually park them somewhere [and] put a signal jammer in there or cut out the GPS,” the Florida source told me. This buys them time to swap and reprogram the vehicle identification number (VIN), wipe car computers, and reprogram fobs to remove traces of the car’s provenance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No two VINs are the same, and each is assigned to a specific vehicle by the manufacturer. Where they’re placed inside a vehicle varies by make and model. The NICB’s Woolf says cars also have confidential VINs located in places—including their electronic components—that are supposed to be known only to law enforcement and his organization. But criminals have figured out how to find and change them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_37"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s making it more and more difficult for us to identify vehicles as stolen,” Woolf says. “Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All this doesn’t even take very much time. “If you know what you’re doing, and you steal the car at one o’clock today, you can have it completely done at two o’clock today,” says Woolf. A vehicle can be rerouted, reprogrammed, re-VINed, and sometimes even retitled before an owner files a police report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_40"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That appears to have been the plan in the case of the stolen light-gray 2023 Lamborghini Huracán owned by the Rockies’ Kris Bryant.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On September 29, 2024, a carrier hired via a load board arrived at Bryant’s home in Cherry Hills, Colorado, to pick up the car. It was supposed to be transported to Bryant’s Las Vegas residence within a few days. It never showed up there—but it was in fact in Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using Flock traffic cameras, which capture license plate information in areas across the country, Detective Justin Smith of the Cherry Hills Village Police Department tracked the truck and trailer that had picked up the Lambo to Nevada, and he alerted local police.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On October 7, a Las Vegas officer spotted a car matching the Lamborghini’s description and pulled it over. The driver said the Huracán had been brought to his auto shop by a man whom the police were able to identify as Dat Viet Tieu. They arrested Tieu later that same day. In an interview with police, he identified himself as a car broker. He said he was going to resell the Lamborghini and that he had no idea that the car was stolen, according to the arrest report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Police searched a Jeep Wrangler that Tieu had parked nearby and discovered it had been stolen—and had been re-VINed, retitled, and registered to his wife. Inside the car, police discovered “multiple fraudulent VIN stickers, key fobs to other high-end stolen vehicles, and fictitious placards,” their report said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the fake VINs matched the make and model of Bryant’s Lamborghini. (Representatives for Bryant and the Rockies did not respond to a request for comment.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tieu was released on bail. But after he returned to LVPD headquarters two days later, on October 9, to reclaim his personal property, officers secretly placed him under surveillance with the hope that he’d lead them to one of the other stolen cars matching the key fobs they’d found in the Jeep.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for them to get lucky. A few hours after leaving the police station, Tieu drove to Harry Reid International Airport, where he picked up an unidentified man. They drove to the Caesars Palace parking garage and pulled in near a GMC Sierra. Over the next three hours, the man worked on a laptop inside and outside the vehicle, according to a police report. At one point, he and Tieu connected jumper cables from Tieu’s rented Toyota Camry to the Sierra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_43"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“At 2323 hours, the white male adult enters the GMC Sierra, and the vehicle’s ignition starts. It was readily apparent the [two men] had successfully re-programmed a key fob to the GMC Sierra,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An officer watched as the man gave two key fobs to Tieu, who handed the man an unknown amount of cash. Still, the police let the men leave the garage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The police kept Tieu and his wife under surveillance for more than a week. Then, on October 18, fearing the couple was about to leave town, officers entered Nora’s Italian Restaurant just off the Vegas Strip and took them into custody.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Obviously, we meet again,” a detective told Tieu.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’m not surprised,” Tieu replied.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Police later searched the VIN on the Sierra from the Caesars lot and found that it had been reported stolen in Tremonton, Utah, roughly two weeks earlier. They eventually returned both the Sierra and Kris Bryant’s Lamborghini to their owners.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tieu pleaded guilty to two felony counts of possession of a stolen vehicle and one count of defacing, altering, substituting, or removing a VIN. In October, he was sentenced to up to one year of probation; if it’s completed successfully, the plea agreement says, the counts of possession of a stolen vehicle will be dismissed. His attorneys, David Z. Chesnoff and Richard A. Schonfeld, said in a statement that they were “pleased” with the court’s decision, “in light of [Tieu’s] acceptance of responsibility.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Taking the heat&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many vehicles stolen via transport fraud are never recovered. Experts say the best way to stop this criminal cycle would be to disrupt it before it starts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_45"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That would require significant changes to the way that load boards operate. Bryant’s Lamborghini, Zahr’s and Payne’s Rolls-Royces, and the orange Lamborghini Urus in Florida were all posted for transport on Central Dispatch. Both brokers and shippers argue that the company hasn’t taken enough responsibility for what they characterize as weak oversight.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company … they have no liability in the whole transaction process. So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Fred Mills, owner of Florida-based Advantage Auto Transport&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You’re Cox Automotive—you’re the biggest car company in the world for dealers—and you’re not doing better screenings when you sign people up?” says Payne. (The spokesperson for Cox Automotive said that it has “a robust verification process for all clients … who sign up.”)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_47"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company, or the clients’ insurance, [which means] that they have no liability in the whole transaction process,” says Mills. “So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the last year, Central Dispatch has made changes to further secure its platform. It introduced two-factor authentication for user accounts and started enabling shippers to use its app to track loads in real time, among other measures. It also kicked off an awareness campaign that includes online educational content and media appearances to communicate that the company takes its responsibilities seriously.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’ve removed over 500 accounts already in 2025, and we’ll continue to take any of that aggressive action where it’s needed,” said Lainey Sibble, Central Dispatch’s head of business, in a sponsored episode of the &lt;em&gt;Auto Remarketing Podcast&lt;/em&gt;. “We also recognize this is not going to happen in a silo. Everyone has a role to play here, and it’s really going to take us all working together in partnership to combat this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mills says Central Dispatch got faster at shutting down fraudulent accounts toward the end of last year. But it’s going to take time to fix the industry, he adds: “I compare it to a 15-year opioid addiction. It’s going to take a while to detox the system.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yariv, the broker in West Palm Beach, says he has stopped using Central Dispatch and other load boards altogether. “One person has access here, and that’s me. I don’t even log in,” he told me. His team has gone back to working the phones, as evidenced by the din of voices in the background as we spoke.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1132657" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/MITReview-spo2.jpg?w=2498" width="2498" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;RICHARD CHANCE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“[The fraud is] everywhere. It’s constant,” he said. “The only way it goes away is the dispatch boards have to be shut down—and that’ll never happen.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_49"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also remains to be seen what kind of accountability there will be for the alleged thieves in Florida. Korotovskyy and Nazarian pleaded not guilty; as of press time, their trials were scheduled to begin in May. (Korotovskyy’s lawyer, Bruce Prober, said in a statement that the case “is an ongoing matter” and his client is “presumed innocent,” while Nazarian’s attorney, Yale Sanford, said in a statement, “As the investigation continues, Mr. Nazarian firmly asserts his innocence.” A spokesperson with Florida’s Office of the State Attorney emailed a statement: “The circumstances related to these arrests are still a matter of investigation and prosecution. It would be inappropriate to be commenting further.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In contrast, Gevorgyan, the third man arrested in the Florida sting, pleaded guilty to four charges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet he maintains his innocence, according to Cooper, his lawyer: “He was pleading [guilty] to get out and go home.” Cooper describes his client as a wealthy Armenian national who runs a jewelry business back home, adding that he was deported to Armenia in September.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cooper says his client’s “sweetheart” plea deal doesn’t require him to testify or otherwise supply information against his alleged co-conspirators—or to reveal details about how all these luxury cars were mysteriously disappearing across South Florida. Cooper also says prosecutors may have a difficult time convicting the other two men, arguing that police acted prematurely by arresting the trio without first seeing what, if anything, they intended to do with the Lamborghini.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“All they ever had,” Cooper says, “was three schmucks sitting outside of the Lamborghini.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Craig Silverman is an award-winning journalist and the cofounder of &lt;/em&gt;Indicator&lt;em&gt;, a publication that reports on digital deception.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/17/1132538/curious-case-disappearing-lambhorghinis/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Goldman Sachs deploys Anthropic systems with success (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/goldman-sachs-ai-deploys-anthropic-systems-with-success/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Goldman’s prior experience with Claude models used internally for software development informed its decision to extend AI to other areas of operations.

They divert the shipment away from its intended destination before using a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance is a major problem. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bioengineer and computational biologist César de la Fuente has a plan. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments—and his quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places.

This offers enterprises a potential reduction in inference costs and increased flexibility in deployment architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central narrative of the Qwen 3.5 release is this technical alignment with leading proprietary systems. Alibaba is explicitly targeting benchmarks established by high-performance US models, including GPT-5.2 and Claude 4.5. This positioning indicates an intent to compete directly on output quality rather than just price or accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology expert Anton P. states that the model is “trading blows with Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 across the board.” He adds that the model “beats frontier models on browsing, reasoning, instruction following.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alibaba-qwen-s-performance-convergence-with-closed-models"&gt;Alibaba Qwen’s performance convergence with closed models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, this performance parity suggests that open-weight models are no longer solely for low-stakes or experimental use cases. They are becoming viable candidates for core business logic and complex reasoning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flagship Alibaba Qwen model contains 397 billion parameters but utilises a more efficient architecture with only 17 billion active parameters. This sparse activation method, often associated with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, allows for high performance without the computational penalty of activating every parameter for every token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This architectural choice results in speed improvements. Shreyasee Majumder, a Social Media Analyst at GlobalData, highlights a “massive improvement in decoding speed, which is up to nineteen times faster than the previous flagship version.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faster decoding ultimately translates directly to lower latency in user-facing applications and reduced compute time for batch processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release operates under an Apache 2.0 license. This licensing model allows enterprises to run the model on their own infrastructure, mitigating data privacy risks associated with sending sensitive information to external APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardware requirements for Qwen 3.5 are relatively accessible compared to previous generations of large models. The efficient architecture allows developers to run the model on personal hardware, such as Mac Ultras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Hendrickson, CEO at GenerAIte Solutions, observes that the model is available on OpenRouter for “$3.6/1M tokens,” a pricing that he highlights is “a steal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s Qwen 3.5 series introduces native multimodal capabilities. This allows the model to process and reason across different data types without relying on separate, bolted-on modules. Majumder points to the “ability to navigate applications autonomously through visual agentic capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qwen 3.5 also supports a context window of one million tokens in its hosted version. Large context windows enable the processing of extensive documents, codebases, or financial records in a single prompt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that wasn’t enough, the model also includes native support for 201 languages. This broad linguistic coverage helps multinational enterprises deploy consistent AI solutions across diverse regional markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-considerations-for-implementation"&gt;Considerations for implementation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the technical specifications are promising, integration requires due diligence. TP Huang notes that he has “found larger Qwen models to not be all that great” in the past, though Alibaba’s new release looks “reasonably better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anton P. provides a necessary caution for enterprise adopters: “Benchmarks are benchmarks. The real test is production.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders must also consider the geopolitical origin of the technology. As the model comes from Alibaba, governance teams will need to assess compliance requirements regarding software supply chains. However, the open-weight nature of the release allows for code inspection and local hosting, which mitigates some data sovereignty concerns compared to closed APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s release of Qwen 3.5 forces a decision point. Anton P. asserts that open-weight models “went from ‘catching up’ to ‘leading’ faster than anyone predicted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the enterprise, the decision is whether to continue paying premiums for proprietary US-hosted models or to invest in the engineering resources required to leverage capable yet lower-cost open-source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba enters physical AI race with open-source robot model RynnBrain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111908" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This offers enterprises a potential reduction in inference costs and increased flexibility in deployment architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central narrative of the Qwen 3.5 release is this technical alignment with leading proprietary systems. Alibaba is explicitly targeting benchmarks established by high-performance US models, including GPT-5.2 and Claude 4.5. This positioning indicates an intent to compete directly on output quality rather than just price or accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology expert Anton P. states that the model is “trading blows with Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 across the board.” He adds that the model “beats frontier models on browsing, reasoning, instruction following.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alibaba-qwen-s-performance-convergence-with-closed-models"&gt;Alibaba Qwen’s performance convergence with closed models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, this performance parity suggests that open-weight models are no longer solely for low-stakes or experimental use cases. They are becoming viable candidates for core business logic and complex reasoning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flagship Alibaba Qwen model contains 397 billion parameters but utilises a more efficient architecture with only 17 billion active parameters. This sparse activation method, often associated with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, allows for high performance without the computational penalty of activating every parameter for every token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This architectural choice results in speed improvements. Shreyasee Majumder, a Social Media Analyst at GlobalData, highlights a “massive improvement in decoding speed, which is up to nineteen times faster than the previous flagship version.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faster decoding ultimately translates directly to lower latency in user-facing applications and reduced compute time for batch processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release operates under an Apache 2.0 license. This licensing model allows enterprises to run the model on their own infrastructure, mitigating data privacy risks associated with sending sensitive information to external APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardware requirements for Qwen 3.5 are relatively accessible compared to previous generations of large models. The efficient architecture allows developers to run the model on personal hardware, such as Mac Ultras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Hendrickson, CEO at GenerAIte Solutions, observes that the model is available on OpenRouter for “$3.6/1M tokens,” a pricing that he highlights is “a steal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s Qwen 3.5 series introduces native multimodal capabilities. This allows the model to process and reason across different data types without relying on separate, bolted-on modules. Majumder points to the “ability to navigate applications autonomously through visual agentic capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qwen 3.5 also supports a context window of one million tokens in its hosted version. Large context windows enable the processing of extensive documents, codebases, or financial records in a single prompt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that wasn’t enough, the model also includes native support for 201 languages. This broad linguistic coverage helps multinational enterprises deploy consistent AI solutions across diverse regional markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-considerations-for-implementation"&gt;Considerations for implementation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the technical specifications are promising, integration requires due diligence. TP Huang notes that he has “found larger Qwen models to not be all that great” in the past, though Alibaba’s new release looks “reasonably better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anton P. provides a necessary caution for enterprise adopters: “Benchmarks are benchmarks. The real test is production.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders must also consider the geopolitical origin of the technology. As the model comes from Alibaba, governance teams will need to assess compliance requirements regarding software supply chains. However, the open-weight nature of the release allows for code inspection and local hosting, which mitigates some data sovereignty concerns compared to closed APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s release of Qwen 3.5 forces a decision point.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, Joseph Akintolayo had just sold his fintech company. He, too, had a non-compete, but was noodling on ideas for a company. He knew Heckler, as Akintolayo had once served as an advisor on one of his projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In this downtime, however, they wanted to come together — Heckler, with his connections, and Akintolayo, with his knowledge of AI and supply chains — to try and build something new.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The result was SpendRule, launched last summer as an AI-powered platform that helps healthcare systems track their spending. The company emerged from stealth on Tuesday, with $2 million in funding in a round led by Abundant Venture Partners. Others in the round include MemorialCare Innovation Fund and Zeal Capital Partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Right now, if an item has a barcode, health systems use a three-way match, Akintolayo, the company’s CTO, said, which connects a purchase to an invoice. But a lot of the time, health systems have purchases and contracts (such as maintenance, janitorial, translation services, or laundry) that lack bar codes or easily identifiable purchase receipts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Because these types of purchases can often be tricky and complex to manage, overspending is quite common. SpendRule is a technology that ensures hospitals pay only what was negotiated in their contracts. It is integrated with and operates on top of a hospital system’s current enterprise resource planning software, contract management software, and accounts payable workflows, pulling information from contracts, invoices, internal databases, and vendor data to validate invoices before payment is released. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It flags discrepancies and tells teams when to pay and when not to. Typically, hospitals hire an auditor every two years to perform this function or manually review each invoice. It was a tedious task bound to be automated in this current wave of AI. Already, big names like Kettering Health, MemorialCare, and MUSC Health are using the platform, Akintolayo said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Heckler and Akintolayo started the company only last summer but managed to close a round by Halloween, mainly due to Heckler’s industry connections. “We were able to painlessly close that initial round and use that to grow the team to support the customers,” he said. The new capital will be used to hire and continue developing the company’s AI infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Heckler said SpendRule considers existing invoice auditors its competition, such as SpendMend and GHX. But Akintolayo said again, one main difference is SpendRule’s focus on purchase services, the type of items hospitals buy that do not have barcodes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our goal is to build a more resilient hospital system,” Akintolayo said. “That’s our vision.

The company’s recent disclosures at an Investor Day merit attention from AI decision-makers as they contain assertions about measurable throughput and workflow redesign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG has outlined potential benefits from generative AI. Chief executive Peter Zaffino later described the company’s early projections as “aspirational,” yet in a fourth quarter earnings call, he stated that “we see the abilities are much greater.” The change in tone is indicative of positive internal results, and according to Zaffino, “We’re seeing a massive change in our ability to process a submission flow way […] without additional human capital resources. That has been the biggest surprise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s claims that generative AI has increased submission processing capacity, the economic impact is direct. AIG reports that in 2025 it “made progress embedding generative AI in our core underwriting and claims processes, and expanding it.” The company’s internal tool, AIG Assist, is implemented in most commercial lines of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lexington Insurance, AIG’s excess and surplus unit has targetted reaching 500,000 submissions by 2030. Zaffino reports that Lexington has already surpassed 370,000 submissions in 2025. AIG uses generative models to extract and summarise incoming data, and has developed an orchestration layer in the technology stack “to coordinate AI agents to drive better decision-making and reduce costs in the organisation.” Previous Investor Days, this level of orchestration was not a focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief executive describes AI agents “as companions that operate with our teams” that provide real-time information, draw on historical cases, and challenge underwriting decisions. The company relies on its ability to manage incoming data “at a fraction of the time” and to orchestrate agents so they can “scale and be able to analyse that information that’s not biased in any way; that’s through the entire workflow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG links orchestration to compression of what it terms a “front-to-back workflow,” a tighter integration between intake, risk assessment and claims handling. The company states that multiple agents, coordinated through a orchestration layer, streamlines repetitive and previously-lengthy processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG has applied its generative AI stack in specific transactions. During the conversion of Everest’s retail commercial business, the company reports that accounts were prioritised for renewal “in a fraction of the time.” Management states that it built an ontology of Everest’s portfolio and combined it with its own, which “allowed [the company] to prioritise how the portfolios could blend together.” Ontological alignment is technically demanding and often creates underestimated costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of Lloyd’s Syndicate 2479, in partnership with Amwins and Blackstone, extended the ontological approach to a special purpose vehicle. In conjunction with Palantir, AIG used LLMs to assess whether Amwins’ programme portfolio aligned with the syndicate’s stated risk appetite. Zaffino stated that AIG has a “strong pipeline of SPV opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For AI decision-makers, the case illustrates the use that orchestration and workflow integration can provide when generative models are embedded in core processes, and the degree to which economic impact depends on measurable changes in capacity and cycle time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Nagasaki, AIG (Insurance company) building” by Admanchester is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0. )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The plans were outlined on Tuesday by India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw (pictured above) at the Indian government-backed five-day AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, attended by senior executives from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and other global technology firms. To attract investment, the government is rolling out a mix of tax incentives, state-backed venture capital, and policy support aimed at pulling more of the global AI value chain into the South Asian nation.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India’s pitch comes as U.S. technology giants, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have already committed about $70 billion to expand AI and cloud infrastructure in the country, giving New Delhi a foundation to argue it can combine scale, cost advantages, and policy incentives to attract the next wave of global AI computing investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the bulk of the projected $200 billion is expected to flow into AI infrastructure — including data centers, chips, and supporting systems, and encompassing the around $70 billion already pledged by Big Tech companies — Vaishnaw said the Indian government also anticipates an additional $17 billion of investment into deep-tech and AI applications, highlighting a push to move beyond infrastructure and capture more of the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The effort is backed by recent policy decisions &lt;span&gt;aimed at making India a more attractive base for AI computing, including&amp;nbsp;long-term tax relief for export-oriented cloud services&amp;nbsp;and a&amp;nbsp;₹100 billion (about&lt;/span&gt; $1.1 billion) government-backed venture program targeting high-risk areas such as AI and advanced manufacturing. Earlier this month, New Delhi also extended the period for which deep-tech companies qualify as startups to 20 years and raised the revenue threshold for startup-specific benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.08 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have seen VCs committing funds for dtech startups,” Vaishnaw said at a press briefing on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. “We have seen VCs and other players committing funds for big solutions, big applications. We have seen VCs committing funds for further research in cutting-edge models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India plans to scale its shared compute capacity under the IndiaAI Mission beyond its existing 38,000 GPUs, the minister said, with an additional 20,000 units to be added in the coming weeks, signaling what he described as the next phase of the country’s AI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Looking ahead, Vaishnaw said the Indian government is preparing a second phase of its AI Mission, with a stronger focus on research and development, innovation, and wider diffusion of AI tools, alongside further expansion of shared compute capacity, as India seeks to broaden access to AI infrastructure beyond a small group of companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The push also faces structural challenges, including access to reliable power and water for energy-intensive data centers, underlining the execution risks as India seeks to compress years of AI infrastructure build-out into a much shorter time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vaishnaw acknowledged those challenges, saying the government was cognizant of the pressure AI infrastructure would place on power and water resources, and pointed to India’s energy mix — with more than half of installed generation capacity coming from clean sources — as an advantage as demand from data centers rises.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whether India can deliver on that vision will matter well beyond its borders, as companies seek new locations for AI computing amid rising costs, capacity constraints, and intensifying global competition.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1246354184.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;India has set out an aggressive push to attract more than $200 billion in artificial-intelligence infrastructure investment over the next two years, as it seeks to position itself as a global hub for AI computing and applications at a time when capacity, capital, and regulation are becoming strategic assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The plans were outlined on Tuesday by India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw (pictured above) at the Indian government-backed five-day AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, attended by senior executives from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and other global technology firms. To attract investment, the government is rolling out a mix of tax incentives, state-backed venture capital, and policy support aimed at pulling more of the global AI value chain into the South Asian nation.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India’s pitch comes as U.S. technology giants, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have already committed about $70 billion to expand AI and cloud infrastructure in the country, giving New Delhi a foundation to argue it can combine scale, cost advantages, and policy incentives to attract the next wave of global AI computing investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the bulk of the projected $200 billion is expected to flow into AI infrastructure — including data centers, chips, and supporting systems, and encompassing the around $70 billion already pledged by Big Tech companies — Vaishnaw said the Indian government also anticipates an additional $17 billion of investment into deep-tech and AI applications, highlighting a push to move beyond infrastructure and capture more of the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The effort is backed by recent policy decisions &lt;span&gt;aimed at making India a more attractive base for AI computing, including&amp;nbsp;long-term tax relief for export-oriented cloud services&amp;nbsp;and a&amp;nbsp;₹100 billion (about&lt;/span&gt; $1.1 billion) government-backed venture program targeting high-risk areas such as AI and advanced manufacturing. Earlier this month, New Delhi also extended the period for which deep-tech companies qualify as startups to 20 years and raised the revenue threshold for startup-specific benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.08 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have seen VCs committing funds for dtech startups,” Vaishnaw said at a press briefing on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. “We have seen VCs and other players committing funds for big solutions, big applications. We have seen VCs committing funds for further research in cutting-edge models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India plans to scale its shared compute capacity under the IndiaAI Mission beyond its existing 38,000 GPUs, the minister said, with an additional 20,000 units to be added in the coming weeks, signaling what he described as the next phase of the country’s AI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Looking ahead, Vaishnaw said the Indian government is preparing a second phase of its AI Mission, with a stronger focus on research and development, innovation, and wider diffusion of AI tools, alongside further expansion of shared compute capacity, as India seeks to broaden access to AI infrastructure beyond a small group of companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The push also faces structural challenges, including access to reliable power and water for energy-intensive data centers, underlining the execution risks as India seeks to compress years of AI infrastructure build-out into a much shorter time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vaishnaw acknowledged those challenges, saying the government was cognizant of the pressure AI infrastructure would place on power and water resources, and pointed to India’s energy mix — with more than half of installed generation capacity coming from clean sources — as an advantage as demand from data centers rises.&lt;/p&gt;

SS&amp;amp;C Blue Prism, however, is here to help, taking customers on the journey from RPA to agentic automation at a pace with which they’re comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big as it may be, this move is a necessary one. Modern workflows are at a level of complexity that outlines what traditional RPA was designed to do, according to Steven Colquitt, VP Software Engineering, SS&amp;amp;C Blue Prism. Unstructured data comes from various sources resembling non-deterministic real-world interactions. “Inputs can vary, outcomes can shift and decisions depend on context in real-time,” notes Colquitt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Halpin, Managing Director, Automation, SS&amp;amp;C Blue Prism, gives the example of a credit agreement where you might need to get 30 or 40 answers from it. He uses the word “answers” deliberately as opposed to data points to account for the level of reasoning that a large language model (LLM) performs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The element of this being a journey continues to resonate, however. “We’re now saying we’re giving an AI agent the outcome that we want, but we’re not giving it the instructions on how to complete,” says Halpin. “We’re not saying, ‘follow step one, two, three, four, five.’ We’re saying, ‘I want this loan reviewed’ or ‘I want this customer onboarded.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, I think that’s where the market will go,” adds Halpin. “Is it ready for that? No. Why? Because there’s trust, there’s regulations, there’s auditability […] stability, security. We know LLMs are prone to hallucinations, we know they drift, and [if] you change the underlying model, things change and responses get different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s an awful lot of learning to happen before I think companies go fully autonomous and real agentic workflows [are] driven from that sort of non-deterministic perspective,” says Halpin. “But then, there will be something else, right? There will be another model. So really, it is all a journey right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SS&amp;amp;C Blue Prism has thousands of customers who have automated processes in place, from centers of excellence (CoEs) to running digital workers in their operations, who they’re hoping to upgrade into the “world of AI”, as Halpin puts it. Sometimes it’s about connecting two separate areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been interesting,” Halpin notes. “As I talk to [our] customers, I see a common thread among companies right now where, in a lot of cases, AI has been established as a separate unit in a company. You go over to the process automation team, and they’re maybe not even allowed to use the AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, it’s about, ‘How do you help them get that capability and blend it into their process efficiency and allow them to get to the next 20%, 30% of automation, in terms of the end-to-end process?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of this, SS&amp;amp;C Blue Prism is soon to launch new technology which helps organizations build and embed AI agents within workflows, as well as assist with orchestration. Those who attended TechEx Global, on February 4-5 as part of the Intelligent Automation conference, where SS&amp;amp;C Blue Prism participated, got the full story, as well as understanding the company’s ongoing path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[SS&amp;amp;C Technologies] are one of the biggest users of RPA in the world,” adds Halpin. “We have over three and a half thousand digital workers deployed [across the SS&amp;amp;C estate]. We’re saving hundreds of millions in run-rate benefit. We’ve about 35 AI agents in production attached to those digital workers doing […] complex tasks, and really, we just want to share that journey.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch the full interview with Brian Halpin below:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls="controls" height="438" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Brian_Halpin_Blue_Prism_IA_03_02.mp4" width="780"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Patrick Tomasso on Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/patrick-tomasso-5hvn-2WW6rY-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For organizations who are still wedded to the rules and structures of robotic process automation (RPA), then considering agentic AI as the next step for automation may be faintly terrifying.

The update, which is initially available to Fire TV owners in the U.S., represents the first major Fire TV redesign in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The changes arrive after an explosion of streaming content has made it more difficult to know what’s available to watch on which service, requiring streaming platforms like Fire TV to serve more as a discovery hub than just a tool to launch streaming apps.  &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company first previewed the new design at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, showing off an interface intended to make Fire TV feel less cluttered. The updated design features rounded corners, varied gradients, consistent typography, and increased spacing between content, and it adds more space for pinned apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3079579" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/3-New-Fire-TV-UI-TV-Show-Screen.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Previously, Fire TV users could only pin six apps to the home screen. Now, with smaller app icons, the update expands that to 20 slots for apps, accommodating services like Netflix, Disney+, YouTube, Prime Video, Hulu, HBO Max, and other top streamers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, the navigation bar at the top of the screen has been simplified into categories marked with simple icons, including &amp;nbsp;Movies, TV, Live TV, Sports, and News. The search button is also easily within reach to the left of the Home tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="New Fire TV UI Sports" class="wp-image-3079580" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Within these tabs, Fire TV surfaces the content you’re already watching and displays other suggestions drawn from the services you’ve subscribed to, organized in rows labeled “For You.” The tabs also highlight free movies to stream, top movies and shows, and other paid content you might enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Live TV tab, meanwhile, centralizes access to the live content that’s available across your streaming services, plus broadcast or cable TV, if you subscribe or use an antenna. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="New Fire TV UI Games" class="wp-image-3079582" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Less frequently used features live under a three-line “hamburger” menu on the left, and include Games, Art &amp;amp; Photos, the Appstore, Music Video &amp;amp; Audio, a universal watchlist called “My Stuff,” Settings, and other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon’s AI assistant Alexa+ is also built into the new interface, allowing users to ask questions on almost any topic, not just movies and TV. Queries can be asked using natural language, and Fire TV owners can refine them or ask follow-up questions as they chat with the AI assistant. The AI can also interact with on-screen content. For instance, you could select a movie tile and say, “Tell me more about that one.” You can even ask nuanced questions like, “Find me more movies that have the same look.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="New Fire TV UI Browse Screen" class="wp-image-3079583" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon recently announced that Alexa+ is available to customers with a Prime subscription as an included perk. Others can choose to pay for access separately. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new user interface launches first on the&amp;nbsp;Fire&amp;nbsp;TV&amp;nbsp;Stick 4K Plus,&amp;nbsp;Fire&amp;nbsp;TV&amp;nbsp;Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen), and&amp;nbsp;the Fire&amp;nbsp;TV&amp;nbsp;Omni Mini-LED Series in the U.S. This spring, it will roll out to more countries and devices, including the latest generation of the Fire TV 4K streaming players and TVs such as the Fire&amp;nbsp;TV&amp;nbsp;2-Series,&amp;nbsp;Fire&amp;nbsp;TV&amp;nbsp;4-Series,&amp;nbsp;and Fire&amp;nbsp;TV&amp;nbsp;Omni QLED Series, as well as TVs made by partners like Hisense, Insignia, Panasonic, and TCL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The update is also available on the new Amazon Ember Artline, a new series of televisions that can make your TV screen look like a framed work of art when not in use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Amazon is rolling out a new user interface for its Fire TV streaming devices, designed to put more focus on the content, while also simplifying navigation.

The feature is designed to work inside the website to understand its content and layout, allowing site owners to make changes with natural language commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the new tool, you can adjust the site’s layout, its style, or other patterns by issuing commands to the AI assistant, and then see the changes reflected on the site as you work. These instructions don’t have to be precisely tailored prompts, either, the company notes. Instead, you can use more general language, like “make this section feel more modern or spacious,” “change my site’s colors to be brighter and bolder,” or “give me more font options that feel clean and professional.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3093460" height="422" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/wordpress-ai-assistant-page-editor.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can also direct the AI to add or adjust your layout, instructing it to do things like “add a contact page,” or “add a testimonials section below this section.” However, the company notes that its adjustments work with block themes, not classic ones. If you’re using the latter, the assistant won’t appear in the editor. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The WordPress AI assistant can update the site’s content, as well, like asking it to rewrite your bio to sound more confident, or translating a section into another language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI can also function like an editor, offering headline suggestions, fact checks, and other grammar and editing suggestions. This aspect is available through the block notes editor that arrived in WordPress 6.9, where you’re able to collaborate with teammates in the editor. Now, you can pull the AI into that workflow by typing @ai followed by your requests. The AI will provide its answers here, including relevant links and other information where it cites external sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3093462" height="394" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ai-block-notes-wordpress-ai-assistant.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, for help with visuals, the assistant leverages Google Gemini’s Nano Banana AI models, which can be used to either make new images or edit existing ones. With the AI helper, available as a new “Generate Image” button in the Media Library, you can specify image requirements like aspect ratios or dictate image styles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3093461" height="417" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-editing-generating-wordpress-ai-assistant.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company notes the WordPress AI Assistant is an opt-in feature users can enable if they choose. To do so, they will need to visit their Sites list once logged in, click their site name, and then Settings. Under settings, they’ll scroll down to “AI tools” and toggle the “Enable AI assistant” setting on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3093463" height="459" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/enable-ai-assistant-wordpress-com.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Instead, you can use more general language, like “make this section feel more modern or spacious,” “change my site’s colors to be brighter and bolder,” or “give me more font options that feel clean and professional.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3093460" height="422" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/wordpress-ai-assistant-page-editor.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can also direct the AI to add or adjust your layout, instructing it to do things like “add a contact page,” or “add a testimonials section below this section.” However, the company notes that its adjustments work with block themes, not classic ones. If you’re using the latter, the assistant won’t appear in the editor. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The WordPress AI assistant can update the site’s content, as well, like asking it to rewrite your bio to sound more confident, or translating a section into another language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI can also function like an editor, offering headline suggestions, fact checks, and other grammar and editing suggestions. This aspect is available through the block notes editor that arrived in WordPress 6.9, where you’re able to collaborate with teammates in the editor. Now, you can pull the AI into that workflow by typing @ai followed by your requests. The AI will provide its answers here, including relevant links and other information where it cites external sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3093462" height="394" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ai-block-notes-wordpress-ai-assistant.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, for help with visuals, the assistant leverages Google Gemini’s Nano Banana AI models, which can be used to either make new images or edit existing ones. With the AI helper, available as a new “Generate Image” button in the Media Library, you can specify image requirements like aspect ratios or dictate image styles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3093461" height="417" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-editing-generating-wordpress-ai-assistant.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company notes the WordPress AI Assistant is an opt-in feature users can enable if they choose. To do so, they will need to visit their Sites list once logged in, click their site name, and then Settings. Under settings, they’ll scroll down to “AI tools” and toggle the “Enable AI assistant” setting on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3093463" height="459" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/enable-ai-assistant-wordpress-com.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Per an email seen by Politico, the parliament’s IT department said it could not guarantee the security of the data uploaded to the servers of AI companies and that the full extent of what information is shared with AI companies is “still being assessed.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As such, the email said, “It is considered safer to keep such features disabled.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Uploading data to AI chatbots, like Anthropic’s Claude, Microsoft’s Copilot, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, means that U.S. authorities can demand the companies that run the chatbots turn over information about their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI chatbots also typically rely on using information that users provide or upload to improve their models, increasing the chance that potentially sensitive information uploaded by one person may be shared and seen by other users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Europe has some of the strongest data protection rules in the world. But the European Commission, the executive body that oversees the 27-member state bloc, last year floated new legislative proposals aimed at relaxing its data protection rules to make it easier for tech giants to train their AI models on Europeans’ data, drawing ire from critics who said the move caves in to U.S. technology giants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move to restrict European lawmakers from accessing AI products on their devices comes as several EU member countries reevaluate their relationships with U.S. tech giants, which remain subject to U.S. law and the unpredictable whims and demands of the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In recent weeks, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has sent hundreds of subpoenas demanding U.S. tech and social media giants turn over information about people, including Americans, who have been publicly critical of the Trump administration’s policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google, Meta, and Reddit complied in several cases, even though the subpoenas had not been issued by a judge and were not enforced by a court.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EU-ai-1258475609.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The European Parliament has reportedly blocked lawmakers from using the baked-in AI tools on their work devices, citing cybersecurity and privacy risks with uploading confidential correspondence to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

As hyperscalers prepare to build out billions of dollars worth of new data centers, the price for DRAM chips has jumped roughly 7x in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, there’s a growing discipline in orchestrating all that memory to make sure the right data gets to the right agent at the right time. The companies that master it will be able to make the same queries with fewer tokens, which can be the difference between folding and staying in business.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Semiconductor analyst Dan O’Laughlin has an interesting look at the importance of memory chips on his Substack, where he talks with Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka. They’re both semiconductor guys, so the focus is more on the chips than the broader architecture; the implications for AI software are pretty significant too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I was particularly struck by this passage, in which Bercovici looks at the growing complexity of Anthropic’s prompt-caching documentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tell is if we go to Anthropic’s prompt caching pricing page. It started off as a very simple page six or seven months ago, especially as Claude Code was launching — just “use caching, it’s cheaper.” Now it’s an encyclopedia of advice on exactly how many cache writes to pre-buy. You’ve got 5-minute tiers, which are very common across the industry, or 1-hour tiers — and nothing above. That’s a really important tell. Then of course you’ve got all sorts of arbitrage opportunities around the pricing for cache reads based on how many cache writes you’ve pre-purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The question here is how long Claude holds your prompt in cached memory: you can pay for a 5-minute window, or pay more for an hour-long window. It’s much cheaper to draw on data that’s still in the cache, so if you manage it right, you can save an awful lot. There is a catch though: every new bit of data you add to the query may bump something else out of the cache window. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is complex stuff, but the upshot is simple enough: Managing memory in AI models is going to be a huge part of AI going forward. Companies that do it well are going to rise to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And there is plenty of progress to be made in this new field. Back in October, I covered a startup called TensorMesh that was working on one layer in the stack known as cache-optimization. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opportunities exist in other parts of the stack. For instance, lower down the stack, there’s the question of how data centers are using the different types of memory they have. (The interview includes a nice discussion of when DRAM chips are used instead of HBM, although it’s pretty deep in the hardware weeds.) Higher up the stack, end users are figuring out how to structure their model swarms to take advantage of the shared cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As companies get better at memory orchestration, they’ll use fewer tokens and inference will get cheaper. Meanwhile, models are getting more efficient at processing each token, pushing the cost down still further. As server costs drop, a lot of applications that don’t seem viable now will start to edge into profitability. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/samsung_50nm_dram.jpg?w=425" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;When we talk about the cost of AI infrastructure, the focus is usually on Nvidia and GPUs — but memory is an increasingly important part of the picture.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, the three engineers are co-founders of Mesh Optical Technologies, a Los Angeles startup that announced a $50 million Series A led by Thrive Capital on Tuesday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mesh aims to mass-produce optical transceivers, devices that convert optical signals from fiber or laser into electrical signals for computers. CEO Brashears, President Ramos, and VP of Product Grown-Haeberli realized the opportunity when designing a new generation of compute-hungry SpaceX satellites forced them to assess the optical transceiver market, and they saw its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Optical transceivers are particularly important for data centers aimed at training and operating large deep learning models, because they allow multiple GPUs to work in concert. One established U.S. supplier, AOI, won a contract worth $4 billion to provide components for AWS data centers last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Someone will brag about a million GPU cluster; you have to multiply by four to five for the number of transceivers in that cluster,” Brashears explained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s goal is to manufacture a thousand units per day within the year so they can begin qualifying for bulk orders in 2027 and 2028.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The optical transceiver market is dominated by Chinese firms and suppliers, and Mesh sees an advantage in building its supply chain outside of that country. While trade restrictions haven’t impacted the market yet, the founders and their backers see themselves as getting in front of a national security dilemma.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If AI is the most important technology in several generations (which we believe to be true), to have critical parts of AI data center capex run through misaligned/competitive countries is a problem,” Thrive Partner Philip Clark wrote TechCrunch. “In the immediate term, Mesh is solving our need for better ways to do interconnect if we want to keep scaling AI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The challenge for Mesh, the founders say, is executing lights-out, automated manufacturing techniques, which aren’t common in U.S. industry. So much of this expertise is concentrated in China that even European equipment suppliers expect Chinese customers — one German firm’s standard intake form asks for a Chinese company registration number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By co-locating design and production, the founders hope to realize more efficient and lower-cost components. Their current design removes one commonly used but power-hungry component, which Ramos said could reduce GPU cluster power usage by 3% to 5%, a meaningful amount as hyperscalers seek to wring as much efficiency out of their systems as possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Data centers are just the beginning of Mesh’s aspirations; the company sees optical wavelength communications as the next paradigm in communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The world has primarily focused on [radio frequencies] for a long time,” Brashears told TechCrunch. “We want to be at the precipice of transition from RF to photonics…we want to interconnect everything, and not just computers, but that’s where we’re starting.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-16-at-11.06.38-AM.png?resize=1200,679" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Travis Brashears, Cameron Ramos and Serena Grown-Haeberli began collaborating at SpaceX, developing optical communications links that keep thousands of Starlink internet satellites in constant contact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The world has primarily focused on [radio frequencies] for a long time,” Brashears told TechCrunch. “We want to be at the precipice of transition from RF to photonics…we want to interconnect everything, and not just computers, but that’s where we’re starting.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/spacex-vets-raise-50m-series-a-for-data-center-links/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Mistral AI buys Koyeb in first acquisition to back its cloud ambitions (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/mistral-ai-buys-koyeb-in-first-acquisition-to-back-its-cloud-ambitions/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/koyeb-team01.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Mistral AI, the French company last valued at $13.8 billion, has made its first acquisition. The OpenAI competitor has agreed to buy Koyeb, a Paris-based startup that simplifies AI app deployment at scale and manages the infrastructure behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral has been primarily known for developing large language models (LLMs), but this deal confirms its ambitions to position itself as a full-stack player. In June 2025, it had announced Mistral Compute, an AI cloud infrastructure offering which it now hopes Koyeb will accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2020 by three former employees of French cloud provider Scaleway, Koyeb aimed to help developers process data without worrying about server infrastructure — a concept known as serverless. This approach gained relevance as AI grew more demanding, also inspiring the recent launch of Koyeb Sandboxes, which provide isolated environments to deploy AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before the acquisition, Koyeb’s platform already helped users deploy models from Mistral and others. In a blog post, Koyeb said its platform will continue operating. But its team and technology will now also help Mistral deploy models directly on clients’ own hardware (on premises), optimize its use of GPUs, and help scale AI inference — the process of running a trained AI model to generate responses — according to a press release from Mistral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the deal, Koyeb’s 13 employees and its three co-founders, Yann Léger, Edouard Bonlieu, and Bastien Chatelard (pictured in 2020), are set to join the engineering team of Mistral, overseen by CTO and co-founder Timothée Lacroix. Under his leadership, Koyeb expects its platform to transition into a “core component” of Mistral Compute over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Koyeb’s product and expertise will accelerate our development on the Compute front, and contribute to building a true AI cloud,” Lacroix wrote in a statement. Mistral has been ramping up its cloud ambitions. Just a few days ago, the company announced a $1.4 billion investment in data centers in Sweden amid growing demand for alternatives to U.S. infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Koyeb had raised $8.6 million to date, including a $1.6 million pre-seed round in 2020, followed in 2023 by a $7 million seed round led by Paris-based VC firm Serena, whose principal Floriane de Maupeou celebrated the acquisition. For the firm, this combination will play a key role “in building the foundations of sovereign AI infrastructure in Europe,” she told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In part thanks to these geopolitical tailwinds, but also due to its focus on helping enterprises unlock value from AI, Mistral recently passed the milestone of $400 million in annual recurring revenue. Koyeb, too, will be focused on enterprise clients going forward, and new users will no longer be able to sign up for its Starter tier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral didn’t disclose financial terms of the deal, and it is unknown whether other acquisitions are in the works. But speaking at Stockholm’s Techarena conference last week, CEO Arthur Mensch said Mistral is hiring for infrastructure and other roles, pitching the company to prospective employees as an organization that is “headquartered in Europe, that is doing frontier research in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/koyeb-team01.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Mistral AI, the French company last valued at $13.8 billion, has made its first acquisition.

In a post announcing the new model, Anthropic emphasized improvements in coding, instruction-following, and computer use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sonnet 4.6 will be the default model for Free and Pro plan users.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The beta release of Sonnet 4.6 will include a context window of 1 million tokens, twice the size of the largest window previously available for Sonnet. Anthropic described the new context window as “enough to hold entire codebases, lengthy contracts, or dozens of research papers in a single request.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The release comes just two weeks after the launch of Opus 4.6, with an updated Haiku model likely to follow in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch comes with a new set of record benchmark scores, including OS World for computer use and SWE-Bench for software engineering. But perhaps the most impressive is its 60.4% score on ARC-AGI-2, meant to measure skills specific to human intelligence. The score puts Sonnet 4.6 above most comparable models, although it still trails models like Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Deep Think, and one refined version of GPT 5.2.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Claude-Chrome-Ext_email-hero-hero.png?w=1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Anthropic has released a new version of its mid-size Sonnet model, keeping pace with the company’s four-month update cycle.
