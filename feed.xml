I’m sharing it here in case you’re interested. I think the talk has something for everyone. There’s some fun stuff in there. I even make jokes!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;video&amp;nbsp;is now available (thank you, SXSW London).&amp;nbsp;Below is a quick look at my top five. Let me know if you would have picked different ones!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Generative AI is now so good it’s scary.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe you think that’s obvious. But I am constantly having to check my assumptions about how fast this technology is progressing—and it’s my job to keep up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, my colleague—and your regular Algorithm writer—James O’Donnell shared 10 music tracks with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;editorial team and challenged us to pick which ones had been produced using generative AI and which had been made by people. Pretty much everybody did worse than chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s happening with music is happening across media, from code to robotics to protein synthesis to video. Just look at what people are doing with new video-generation tools like Google DeepMind’s Veo 3. And this technology is being put into everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My point here? Whether you think AI is the best thing to happen to us or the worst, do not underestimate it. It’s good, and it’s getting better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Hallucination is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget the fails. When AI makes up stuff, we call it hallucination. Think of customer service bots offering nonexistent refunds, lawyers submitting briefs filled with nonexistent cases, or RFK Jr.’s government department publishing a report that cites nonexistent academic papers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll hear a lot of talk that makes hallucination sound like it’s a problem we need to fix. The more accurate way to think about hallucination is that this is exactly what generative AI does—what it’s meant to do—all the time. Generative models are trained to make things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s remarkable is not that they make up nonsense, but that the nonsense they make up so often matches reality.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Why does this matter? First, we need to be aware of what this technology can and can’t do. But also: Don’t hold out for a future version that doesn’t hallucinate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. AI is power hungry and getting hungrier.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard that AI is power hungry. But a lot of that reputation comes from the amount of electricity it takes to train these giant models, though giant models only get trained every so often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s changed is that these models are now being used by hundreds of millions of people every day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;And while using a model takes far less energy than training one, the energy costs ramp up massively with those kinds of user numbers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT, for example, has 400 million weekly users. That makes it the fifth-most-visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X. Other chatbots are catching up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s no surprise that tech companies are racing to build new data centers in the desert and revamp power grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is we’ve been in the dark about exactly how much energy it takes to fuel this boom because none of the major companies building this technology have shared much information about it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s starting to change, however. Several of my colleagues spent months working with researchers to crunch the numbers for some open source versions of this tech. (Do check out what they found.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Nobody knows exactly how large language models work.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure, we know how to build them. We know how to make them work really well—see no. 1 on this list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how they do what they do is still an unsolved mystery. It’s like these things have arrived from outer space and scientists are poking and prodding them from the outside to figure out what they really are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s incredible to think that never before has a mass-market technology used by billions of people been so little understood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does that matter? Well, until we understand them better we won’t know exactly what they can and can’t do. We won’t know how to control their behavior. We won’t fully understand hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. AGI doesn’t mean anything.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not long ago, talk of AGI was fringe, and mainstream researchers were embarrassed to bring it up.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;But as AI has got better and far more lucrative, serious people are happy to insist they’re about to create it. Whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGI—or artificial general intelligence—has come to mean something like: AI that can match the performance of humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does that mean? How do we measure performance? Which humans? How wide a range of tasks? And performance on cognitive tasks is just another way of saying intelligence—so the definition is circular anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, when people refer to AGI they now tend to just mean AI, but better than what we have today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s this absolute faith in the progress of AI. It’s gotten better in the past, so it will continue to get better. But there is zero evidence that this will actually play out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave us? We are building machines that are getting very good at mimicking some of the things people do, but the technology still has serious flaws. And we’re only just figuring out how it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how I think about AI: We have built machines with humanlike behavior, but we haven’t shrugged off the habit of imagining a humanlike mind behind them.&lt;/strong&gt; This leads to exaggerated assumptions about what AI can do and plays into the wider culture wars between techno-optimists and techno-skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s right to be amazed by this technology. It’s also right to be skeptical of many of the things said about it. It’s still very early days, and it’s all up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

Pieces cracked off, sparks ricocheted, and dust whirled around under a blast of air.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From inside a modified trailer, I peeked through the window as a millimeter-wave drilling rig attached to an unassuming box truck melted a hole into a piece of basalt in less than two minutes. After the test was over, I stepped out of the trailer into the Houston heat. I could see a ring of black, glassy material stamped into the slab fragments, evidence of where the rock had melted.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This rock-melting drilling technology from the geothermal startup Quaise is certainly unconventional. The company hopes it’s the key to unlocking geothermal energy and making it feasible anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Geothermal power tends to work best in those parts of the world that have the right geology and heat close to the surface. Iceland and the western US, for example, are hot spots for this always-available renewable energy source because they have all the necessary ingredients. But by digging deep enough, companies could theoretically tap into the Earth’s heat from anywhere on the globe.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That’s a difficult task, though. In some places, accessing temperatures high enough to efficiently generate electricity would require drilling miles and miles beneath the surface. Often, that would mean going through very hard rock, like granite.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s proposed solution is a new mode of drilling that eschews the traditional technique of scraping into rock with a hard drill bit. Instead, the company plans to use a gyrotron, a device that emits high-frequency electromagnetic radiation. Today, the fusion power industry uses gyrotrons to heat plasma to 100 million °C, but Quaise plans to use them to blast, melt, and vaporize rock. This could, in theory, make drilling faster and more economical, allowing for geothermal energy to be accessed anywhere.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Since Quaise’s founding in 2018, the company has demonstrated that its systems work in the controlled conditions of the laboratory, and it has started trials in a semi-controlled environment, including the backyard of its Houston headquarters. Now these efforts are leaving the lab, and the team is taking gyrotron drilling technology to a quarry to test it in real-world conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some experts caution that reinventing drilling won’t be as simple, or as fast, as Quaise’s leadership hopes. The startup is also attempting to raise a large funding round this year, at a time when economic uncertainty is slowing investment and the US climate technology industry is in a difficult spot politically because of policies like tariffs and a slowdown in government support. Quaise’s big idea aims to accelerate an old source of renewable energy. This make-or-break moment might determine how far that idea can go.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blasting through&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rough calculations from the geothermal industry suggest that enough energy is stored inside the Earth to meet our energy demands for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years, says Matthew Houde, cofounder and chief of staff at Quaise. After that, other sources like fusion should be available, “assuming we continue going on that long, so to speak,” he quips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We want to be able to scale this style of geothermal beyond the locations where we’re able to readily access those temperatures today with conventional drilling,” Houde says. The key, he adds, is simply going deep enough: “If we can scale those depths to 10 to 20 kilometers, then we can enable super-hot geothermal to be worldwide accessible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though that’s technically possible, there are few examples of humans drilling close to this depth. One research project that began in 1970 in the former Soviet Union reached just over 12 kilometers, but it took nearly 20 years and was incredibly expensive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise hopes to speed up drilling and cut its cost, Houde says. The company’s goal is to drill through rock at a rate of between three and five meters per hour of steady operation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One key factor slowing down many operations that drill through hard rocks like granite is nonproductive time. For example, equipment frequently needs to be brought all the way back up to the surface for repairs or to replace drill bits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s key to potentially changing that is its gyrotron. The device emits millimeter waves, beams of energy with wavelengths that fall between microwaves and infrared waves. It’s a bit like a laser, but the beam is not visible to the human eye.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s goal is to heat up the target rock, effectively drilling it away. The gyrotron beams waves at a target rock via a waveguide, a hollow metal tube that directs the energy to the right spot. (One of the company’s main technological challenges is to avoid accidentally making plasma, an ionized, superheated state of matter, as it can waste energy and damage key equipment like the waveguide.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works in practice: When Quaise’s rig is drilling a hole, the tip of the waveguide is positioned a foot or so away from the rock it’s targeting. The gyrotron lets out a burst of millimeter waves for about a minute. They travel down the waveguide and hit the target rock, which heats up and then cracks, melts, or even vaporizes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then the beam stops, and the drill bit at the end of the waveguide is lowered to the surface of the rock, rotating and scraping off broken shards and melted bits of rock as it descends. A steady blast of air carries the debris up to the surface, and the process repeats. The energy in the millimeter waves does the hard work, and the scraping and compressed air help remove the fractured or melted material away.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This system is what I saw in action at the company’s Houston headquarters. The drilling rig in the yard is a small setup, something like what a construction company might use to drill micro piles for a foundation or what researchers would use to take geological samples. In total, the gyrotron has a power of 100 kilowatts. A cooling system helps the superconducting magnet in the gyrotron reach the necessary temperature (about -200 °C), and a filtration system catches the debris that sloughs off samples.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Quaise truck and mobile drill unit" class="wp-image-1120477" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_6268.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CASEY CROWNHART&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after my visit, this backyard setup was packed up and shipped to central Texas to be used for further field testing in a rock quarry. The company announced in July that it had used that rig to drill a 100-meter-deep hole at that field test site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise isn’t the first to develop nonmechanical drilling, says Roland Horne, head of the geothermal program at Stanford University. “Burning holes in rocks is impressive. However, that’s not the whole of what’s involved in drilling,” he says. The operation will need to be able to survive the high temperatures and pressures at the bottom of wells as they’re drilled, he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So far, the company has found success drilling holes into columns of rock inside metal casings, as well as the quarry in its field trials. But there’s a long road between drilling into predictable material in a relatively predictable environment and creating a miles-deep geothermal well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rocky roads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In April, Quaise fully integrated its second 100-kilowatt gyrotron onto an oil and gas rig owned by the company’s investor and technology partner Nabors. This rig is the sort that would typically be used for training or engineering development, and it’s set up along with a row of other rigs at the Nabors headquarters, just across town from the Quaise lab. At 182 feet high, the top is visible above the office building from the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When I visited in April, the company was still completing initial tests, using special thermal paper and firing short blasts to test the setup. In May the company tested this integrated rig, drilling a hole four inches in diameter and 30 feet deep. Another test in June reached a depth of 40 feet. These holes were drilled into columns of basalt that had been lowered into the ground as a test material.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the company tests its 100-kilowatt systems at the rig and the quarry, the next step is an even larger system, which features a gyrotron that’s 10 times more powerful. This one-megawatt system will drill larger holes, over eight inches across, and represents the commercial-scale version of the company’s technology. Drilling tests are set to begin with this larger drill in 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The one-megawatt system actually needs a little over three megawatts of power overall, including the energy needed to run support equipment like cooling systems and the compressor that blows air into the hole, carrying the rock dust back up to the surface. That power demand is similar to what an oil and gas rig requires today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise is in the process of setting up a pilot plant in Oregon, basically on the side of a volcano, says Trenton Cladouhos, the company’s vice president of geothermal resource development. This project will use conventional drilling, and its main purpose is to show that Quaise can build and run a geothermal plant, Cladouhos says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is building an exploration well this year and plans to begin drilling production wells (those that can eventually be used to generate electricity) in 2026. That pilot project will reach about 20 megawatts of power with the first few wells, operating on rock that’s around 350 °C. The company plans to have it operational as early as 2028.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s strategy with the Oregon project is to show that it can use super-hot rocks to produce geothermal power efficiently, says CEO Carlos Araque. After it fires up the plant and begins producing electricity, the company can go back in and deepen the holes with millimeter-wave drilling in the future, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls="controls" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Quaise.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A drilling test shows Quaise's millimeter-wave technology drilling into a piece of granite. &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Araque says the company already has some customers lined up for the energy it’ll produce, though he declined to name them, saying only that one was a big tech company, and there’s a utility involved as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the startup will need more capital to finish this project and complete its testing with the larger, one-megawatt gyrotron. And uncertainty is floating around in climate tech, given the Trump administration’s tariffs and rollback of financial support for climate tech (though geothermal has been relatively unscathed).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Quaise still has some technical barriers to overcome before it begins building commercial power plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One potential hurdle: drilling in different directions. Right now, millimeter-wave drilling can go in a straight line, straight down. Developing a geothermal plant like the one at the Oregon site will likely require what’s called directional drilling, the ability to drill in directions other than vertical.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the company will likely face challenges as it transitions from lab testing to field trials. One key challenge for geothermal technology companies attempting to operate at this depth will be&amp;nbsp; keeping wells functional for a long time to keep a power plant operating, says Jefferson Tester, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in geothermal energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s technology is very aspirational, Tester says, and it can be difficult for new ideas in geothermal to compete economically. “It’s eventually all about cost,” he says. And companies with ambitious ideas run the risk that their investors will run out of patience before they can develop their technology enough to make it onto the grid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot more to learn—I mean, we’re reinventing drilling,” says Steve Jeske, a project manager at Quaise. “It seems like it shouldn’t work, but it does.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A beam of energy hit the slab of rock, which quickly began to glow. Pieces cracked off, sparks ricocheted, and dust whirled around under a blast of air.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From inside a modified trailer, I peeked through the window as a millimeter-wave drilling rig attached to an unassuming box truck melted a hole into a piece of basalt in less than two minutes. After the test was over, I stepped out of the trailer into the Houston heat. I could see a ring of black, glassy material stamped into the slab fragments, evidence of where the rock had melted.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This rock-melting drilling technology from the geothermal startup Quaise is certainly unconventional. The company hopes it’s the key to unlocking geothermal energy and making it feasible anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Geothermal power tends to work best in those parts of the world that have the right geology and heat close to the surface. Iceland and the western US, for example, are hot spots for this always-available renewable energy source because they have all the necessary ingredients. But by digging deep enough, companies could theoretically tap into the Earth’s heat from anywhere on the globe.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That’s a difficult task, though. In some places, accessing temperatures high enough to efficiently generate electricity would require drilling miles and miles beneath the surface. Often, that would mean going through very hard rock, like granite.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s proposed solution is a new mode of drilling that eschews the traditional technique of scraping into rock with a hard drill bit. Instead, the company plans to use a gyrotron, a device that emits high-frequency electromagnetic radiation. Today, the fusion power industry uses gyrotrons to heat plasma to 100 million °C, but Quaise plans to use them to blast, melt, and vaporize rock. This could, in theory, make drilling faster and more economical, allowing for geothermal energy to be accessed anywhere.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Since Quaise’s founding in 2018, the company has demonstrated that its systems work in the controlled conditions of the laboratory, and it has started trials in a semi-controlled environment, including the backyard of its Houston headquarters. Now these efforts are leaving the lab, and the team is taking gyrotron drilling technology to a quarry to test it in real-world conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some experts caution that reinventing drilling won’t be as simple, or as fast, as Quaise’s leadership hopes. The startup is also attempting to raise a large funding round this year, at a time when economic uncertainty is slowing investment and the US climate technology industry is in a difficult spot politically because of policies like tariffs and a slowdown in government support. Quaise’s big idea aims to accelerate an old source of renewable energy. This make-or-break moment might determine how far that idea can go.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blasting through&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rough calculations from the geothermal industry suggest that enough energy is stored inside the Earth to meet our energy demands for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years, says Matthew Houde, cofounder and chief of staff at Quaise. After that, other sources like fusion should be available, “assuming we continue going on that long, so to speak,” he quips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We want to be able to scale this style of geothermal beyond the locations where we’re able to readily access those temperatures today with conventional drilling,” Houde says. The key, he adds, is simply going deep enough: “If we can scale those depths to 10 to 20 kilometers, then we can enable super-hot geothermal to be worldwide accessible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though that’s technically possible, there are few examples of humans drilling close to this depth. One research project that began in 1970 in the former Soviet Union reached just over 12 kilometers, but it took nearly 20 years and was incredibly expensive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise hopes to speed up drilling and cut its cost, Houde says. The company’s goal is to drill through rock at a rate of between three and five meters per hour of steady operation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One key factor slowing down many operations that drill through hard rocks like granite is nonproductive time. For example, equipment frequently needs to be brought all the way back up to the surface for repairs or to replace drill bits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s key to potentially changing that is its gyrotron. The device emits millimeter waves, beams of energy with wavelengths that fall between microwaves and infrared waves. It’s a bit like a laser, but the beam is not visible to the human eye.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s goal is to heat up the target rock, effectively drilling it away. The gyrotron beams waves at a target rock via a waveguide, a hollow metal tube that directs the energy to the right spot. (One of the company’s main technological challenges is to avoid accidentally making plasma, an ionized, superheated state of matter, as it can waste energy and damage key equipment like the waveguide.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works in practice: When Quaise’s rig is drilling a hole, the tip of the waveguide is positioned a foot or so away from the rock it’s targeting. The gyrotron lets out a burst of millimeter waves for about a minute. They travel down the waveguide and hit the target rock, which heats up and then cracks, melts, or even vaporizes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then the beam stops, and the drill bit at the end of the waveguide is lowered to the surface of the rock, rotating and scraping off broken shards and melted bits of rock as it descends. A steady blast of air carries the debris up to the surface, and the process repeats. The energy in the millimeter waves does the hard work, and the scraping and compressed air help remove the fractured or melted material away.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This system is what I saw in action at the company’s Houston headquarters. The drilling rig in the yard is a small setup, something like what a construction company might use to drill micro piles for a foundation or what researchers would use to take geological samples. In total, the gyrotron has a power of 100 kilowatts. A cooling system helps the superconducting magnet in the gyrotron reach the necessary temperature (about -200 °C), and a filtration system catches the debris that sloughs off samples.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Quaise truck and mobile drill unit" class="wp-image-1120477" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_6268.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CASEY CROWNHART&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after my visit, this backyard setup was packed up and shipped to central Texas to be used for further field testing in a rock quarry. The company announced in July that it had used that rig to drill a 100-meter-deep hole at that field test site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise isn’t the first to develop nonmechanical drilling, says Roland Horne, head of the geothermal program at Stanford University. “Burning holes in rocks is impressive. However, that’s not the whole of what’s involved in drilling,” he says. The operation will need to be able to survive the high temperatures and pressures at the bottom of wells as they’re drilled, he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So far, the company has found success drilling holes into columns of rock inside metal casings, as well as the quarry in its field trials. But there’s a long road between drilling into predictable material in a relatively predictable environment and creating a miles-deep geothermal well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rocky roads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In April, Quaise fully integrated its second 100-kilowatt gyrotron onto an oil and gas rig owned by the company’s investor and technology partner Nabors. This rig is the sort that would typically be used for training or engineering development, and it’s set up along with a row of other rigs at the Nabors headquarters, just across town from the Quaise lab. At 182 feet high, the top is visible above the office building from the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When I visited in April, the company was still completing initial tests, using special thermal paper and firing short blasts to test the setup.

AI agents often struggle to make decisions by themselves, hallucinate frequently, can’t cooperate with other agents, fail at confidentiality awareness, and integrate poorly with existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Industry pioneers like Andrej Karpathy and Ali Ghodsi have said that, like the deployment of autonomous vehicles, humans need to be in the loop in order for agents to succeed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A startup called Mixus wants to address that with its AI agent platform that not only keeps humans in the workflow, it also lets users interact with agents directly from their email or Slack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re meeting customers where they are today,” Elliot Katz, Mixus’ co-founder, told TechCrunch. “Where is every person in the workforce today? For the most part, they’re on email. And so because we can do this through email, we believe that’s a way we can democratize access [to agents].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Mixus works reliably, it may solve a big problem in the AI agent space. Most AI companies today either give you a pre-built assistant, à la ChatGPT or Gemini, or developers have to build custom agents using frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, or crewAI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mixus launched in beta out of Stanford only in late 2024, but it has already raised $2.6 million in pre-seed funding and brought on some customers, including clothing store chain Rainbow Shops, as well as others across finance and tech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup says its biggest selling point is ease of use, from how it helps you create agents to how you can interact with them. Users can use text prompts to set up their agents within Mixus’s platform via a chat function, or by simply emailing instructions to agent@mixus.com. Then Mixus will build, run, and manage single- or multi-step agents directly from the inbox.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, a customer support manager may use a prompt that reads so:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Create an agent that finds all open tasks in Jira in project mixus-dummy, and send me a report with information on all tasks that are overdue. Draft emails to all the assignees who have overdue tasks, and have me review them in the chat and with simple clear formatting for email (no attachments/docs). Once I verify, send the emails. Run it now. And moving forward, run it every Monday at 7am PST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3029966" height="339" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mixus-email-agent-1.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Mixus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Katz and his co-founder Shai Magzimof demoed the agents for TechCrunch, showing how to add human verifiers for your agents by simply instructing at which step the agent should ask you for oversight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, they ran an agent to do research on TechCrunch reporters before pitching them. The agent identified and gathered technology news and trends, analyzed the information to identify potential story angles, and compiled a research report summarizing the findings. At the last stage, the agent was directed to send the information to Katz for verification. Once approved, the agent would send the completed research report to Magzimof.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The founders noted that humans can be in the loop as much or as little as required — Magzimof said organizations can set up company-wide rules, like ensuring an email gets checked by a human if it’s being sent outside the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bringing other colleagues into the workflow is as easy as tagging them in the chat with an AI agent, or copying them on the email to the agent. That’s another standout compared to agents on the markets today: Most models are single-user, and while Notion AI and Slack allow users to collaborate in shared spaces, they don’t let the AI manage conversations and tasks between teammates in real time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another core feature of Mixus is its ability to remember files, chats, prompts and agents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We created Spaces so that every team, every person, every group of people can have a shared memory,” Magzimof said. “Then all my agents, all my files, all the people can be in that very specific Space’s memory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While ChatGPT and Claude both support memory, their enterprise plans don’t yet support shared agent memory across users.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-else-can-mixus-do"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can Mixus do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In our interview, the founders ran through an hour-long demo showing a range of use cases and abilities. Mixus’ agents do seem capable, reflecting a high degree of autonomy and memory that places the company towards the higher end of the AI agent spectrum. That is, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the product works as reliably as it did in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other agents, Mixus can integrate with other tools, from Gmail to Jira, and users can trigger agents to run immediately or on a schedule.&amp;nbsp;Agents can run and edit documents or spreadsheets inline — similar to ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini, but those are often limited to sandboxed environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mixus also lets agents autonomously navigate organizational context — like figuring out who in an organization owns a task by looking through Jira tickets. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Built on a combination of Anthropic’s Claude 4 and OpenAI’s o3, Mixus agents also have access to the web, which Magzimof says can be tapped for tasks like live research or monitoring. He described it as “Google Alerts on steroids.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taken together, Mixus appears to be less of a productivity tool and more like a tireless digital colleague – yet another ambitious attempt to reimagine AI as a collaborator. If it works as advertised, your next “coworker” might not be human, but it might get through your inbox faster than you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This article was updated to reflect how much Mixus has raised to date. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

AI agents often struggle to make decisions by themselves, hallucinate frequently, can’t cooperate with other agents, fail at confidentiality awareness, and integrate poorly with existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Industry pioneers like Andrej Karpathy and Ali Ghodsi have said that, like the deployment of autonomous vehicles, humans need to be in the loop in order for agents to succeed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A startup called Mixus wants to address that with its AI agent platform that not only keeps humans in the workflow, it also lets users interact with agents directly from their email or Slack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re meeting customers where they are today,” Elliot Katz, Mixus’ co-founder, told TechCrunch. “Where is every person in the workforce today? For the most part, they’re on email. And so because we can do this through email, we believe that’s a way we can democratize access [to agents].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Mixus works reliably, it may solve a big problem in the AI agent space. Most AI companies today either give you a pre-built assistant, à la ChatGPT or Gemini, or developers have to build custom agents using frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, or crewAI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mixus launched in beta out of Stanford only in late 2024, but it has already raised $2.6 million in pre-seed funding and brought on some customers, including clothing store chain Rainbow Shops, as well as others across finance and tech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup says its biggest selling point is ease of use, from how it helps you create agents to how you can interact with them. Users can use text prompts to set up their agents within Mixus’s platform via a chat function, or by simply emailing instructions to agent@mixus.com. Then Mixus will build, run, and manage single- or multi-step agents directly from the inbox.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, a customer support manager may use a prompt that reads so:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Create an agent that finds all open tasks in Jira in project mixus-dummy, and send me a report with information on all tasks that are overdue. Draft emails to all the assignees who have overdue tasks, and have me review them in the chat and with simple clear formatting for email (no attachments/docs). Once I verify, send the emails. Run it now. And moving forward, run it every Monday at 7am PST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3029966" height="339" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mixus-email-agent-1.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Mixus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Katz and his co-founder Shai Magzimof demoed the agents for TechCrunch, showing how to add human verifiers for your agents by simply instructing at which step the agent should ask you for oversight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, they ran an agent to do research on TechCrunch reporters before pitching them. The agent identified and gathered technology news and trends, analyzed the information to identify potential story angles, and compiled a research report summarizing the findings. At the last stage, the agent was directed to send the information to Katz for verification. Once approved, the agent would send the completed research report to Magzimof.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The founders noted that humans can be in the loop as much or as little as required — Magzimof said organizations can set up company-wide rules, like ensuring an email gets checked by a human if it’s being sent outside the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bringing other colleagues into the workflow is as easy as tagging them in the chat with an AI agent, or copying them on the email to the agent. That’s another standout compared to agents on the markets today: Most models are single-user, and while Notion AI and Slack allow users to collaborate in shared spaces, they don’t let the AI manage conversations and tasks between teammates in real time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another core feature of Mixus is its ability to remember files, chats, prompts and agents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We created Spaces so that every team, every person, every group of people can have a shared memory,” Magzimof said. “Then all my agents, all my files, all the people can be in that very specific Space’s memory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While ChatGPT and Claude both support memory, their enterprise plans don’t yet support shared agent memory across users.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-else-can-mixus-do"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can Mixus do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In our interview, the founders ran through an hour-long demo showing a range of use cases and abilities. Mixus’ agents do seem capable, reflecting a high degree of autonomy and memory that places the company towards the higher end of the AI agent spectrum. That is, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the product works as reliably as it did in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other agents, Mixus can integrate with other tools, from Gmail to Jira, and users can trigger agents to run immediately or on a schedule.&amp;nbsp;Agents can run and edit documents or spreadsheets inline — similar to ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini, but those are often limited to sandboxed environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mixus also lets agents autonomously navigate organizational context — like figuring out who in an organization owns a task by looking through Jira tickets. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Built on a combination of Anthropic’s Claude 4 and OpenAI’s o3, Mixus agents also have access to the web, which Magzimof says can be tapped for tasks like live research or monitoring. He described it as “Google Alerts on steroids.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taken together, Mixus appears to be less of a productivity tool and more like a tireless digital colleague – yet another ambitious attempt to reimagine AI as a collaborator. If it works as advertised, your next “coworker” might not be human, but it might get through your inbox faster than you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This article was updated to reflect how much Mixus has raised to date. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Overall, steelmaking accounts for around 8% of the world’s carbon emissions—one of the largest industrial emitters and far more than such sources as aviation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of groups and companies are now making serious progress toward low- or zero-emission steel. Among them, the Swedish company Stegra stands out. The startup is currently building the first industrial-scale plant in the world to make green steel. But can it deliver on its promises?

The foundations of our AI future are being laid in concrete, steel, and miles of fibre-optic cable, and those foundations are getting colossally bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, OpenAI and Oracle are going to build new data centres in the US packed with enough hardware to consume 4.5 gigawatts of power. It’s hard to overstate what a staggering amount of energy that is—it’s the kind of power that could light up a major city. And all of it will be dedicated to one thing: powering the next generation of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a random expansion; it’s a huge piece of OpenAI’s grand Stargate plan. The goal is simple: to build enough computing power to bring advanced AI to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you add this new project to the work already underway in Abilene, Texas, OpenAI is now developing over 5 gigawatts of data centre capacity. That’s enough space to run more than two million of the most powerful computer chips available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move shows they are dead serious about a pledge they made at the White House earlier this year to plough half a trillion dollars into US AI infrastructure. In fact, with the momentum they’re getting from partners like Oracle and Japan’s SoftBank, they now expect to blow past that initial goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this story isn’t just about silicon chips and corporate deals; it’s about people. OpenAI believes that building and running these new Stargate AI data centres will create over 100,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That job creation presents real opportunities for families across the country from construction crews pouring the concrete, to specialised electricians wiring up racks of servers, and the full-time technicians who will keep these digital brains running day and night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Abilene, the first phase of OpenAI’s development of Stargate data centres is already humming with activity. The first truckloads of Nvidia’s brand-new GB200 chips have arrived, and OpenAI’s researchers are already using them to see what their next AI models are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, a project this huge is never a two-player game. While Oracle is helping build the physical capacity for the Stargate initiative, OpenAI is also working closely with SoftBank to completely rethink how AI data centres should be designed from the ground up. And let’s not forget Microsoft, which remains the key cloud partner, providing the digital plumbing that connects everything together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the curtain, there is a very real and very human industrial effort underway on a scale we’ve rarely seen before.

Their AI compliance startup, Delve, which announced a $3 million seed round in January, was growing fast and signing customers at a steady clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then, inbound interest started rolling in, COO Kocalar told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Delve, which automates regulatory compliance with AI agents, ended up fielding multiple term sheets, eventually closing a $32 million Series A at a $300 million valuation. The round was led by Insight Partners, which took up most of the round, with participation from CISOs at Fortune 500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Insight has been “amazing to work with, and we felt they were the right long-term partner for us,” said the COO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Delve’s new valuation represents a roughly 10x jump from its previous round. Similarly, its customer base has grown from the 100 companies it reported back in January to over 500, many of them fast-growing AI startups like recently minted AI unicorn Lovable, Bland, and Wispr Flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And while the 2-year-old company, made up of AI researchers from MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley, has seemingly struck gold by using AI to eliminate hundreds of hours of manual processes, its story began much differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kaushik and Kocalar met as classmates during their freshman year at MIT. Both had deep interests in AI and health tech. Kaushik had already scaled a COVID diagnostic system to thousands of users during the pandemic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2023, they began working on an AI-powered medical scribe to help doctors handle patient documentation. However, handling sensitive healthcare information meant they quickly encountered the costly and time-consuming world of HIPAA compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead of continuing with the medical scribe, they started building tools to help other companies get HIPAA-compliant faster and more affordably. That pivot got the team into Y Combinator last year and helped them raise their seed round from General Catalyst, FundersClub, Soma Capital, and others. The founders dropped out during their sophomore year in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What started with HIPAA quickly expanded. “As our customer base grew, they started asking for support with other frameworks: SOC 2, PCI, GDPR, ISO, basically the whole alphabet soup of compliance,” Kocalar narrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Delve" class="wp-image-3029945" height="467" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;L-R: Selin Kocalar (COO) and Karun Kaushik (CEO) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Delve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Compliance paperwork can be necessary in everything from launching products to closing enterprise deals. But instead of driving growth, its manual work can become a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Compliance frameworks are standardized. Businesses aren’t,” says CEO Kaushik. “That mismatch is why traditional software breaks down and teams fall back to duct-taped workflows across email, Slack, and shared drives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Delve replaces that busywork with AI agents that run in the background (after integrating with customers’ tools) like internal team members. These agents collect evidence, write reports, update audit logs, and track configuration changes across fragmented systems, automating compliance workflows in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kocalar says compliance is just the wedge into broader back-office operations. Long-term, the AI startup wants to automate a billion hours of other work — eventually expanding into adjacent areas like cybersecurity, risk, and internal governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Insight Partners’ interest reflects this roadmap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Since compliance touches every part of how a business runs, from scaling operations to closing deals to building customer trust, modernizing this function will modernize the entire organization,” said Praveen Akkiraju, managing director at Insight. “That’s what makes Delve’s approach so important.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the startup won’t be without competition. Several AI companies are emerging with agents to automate business workflows. In addition, larger AI labs like OpenAI are releasing general-purpose agents capable of performing complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, Kocalar says these developments are a validation, not a threat, to Delve’s business. She points to the company’s domain depth in contrast to more general-purpose agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re positioning ourselves to improve as AI advances and labs roll out more sophisticated agentic technologies. But what truly sets us apart is the deep, domain-specific knowledge we’re building into the platform,” she said. “Compliance is always shifting as new regulations emerge and existing ones evolve, with companies interpreting them in different ways.

            &lt;p&gt;Seven faculty in the MIT School of Architecture and Planning (SA+P) have been honored for their contributions through promotions, effective July 1. Three faculty promotions are in the Department of Architecture; three are in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning; and one is in the Program in Media Arts and Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether architects, urbanists, computer scientists, or nanotechnologists, they represent our school at its best, in its breadth of inquiry and mission to improve the relationship between human beings and their environments,” says SA+P Dean Hashim Sarkis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Department of Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcelo Coelho&lt;/strong&gt; has been promoted to associate professor of the practice. Coelho is the director of the Design Intelligence Lab, which explores the intersection of human and machine intelligence across design, AI, and fabrication. His work ranges from light-based installations to physical computing. Recognition for his work includes two Prix Ars Electronica awards and &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;’s Innovation by Design Award. Coelho’s experimental approach redefines creative processes, transforming how we imagine and interact with intelligent systems. Coelho teaches courses that bring together industrial design, user experience, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holly Samuelson&lt;/strong&gt; has been promoted to associate professor without tenure. Samuelson has co-authored over 40 peer-reviewed papers, winning a Best Paper award from the journal &lt;em&gt;Energy and Building.&lt;/em&gt; As a recognized expert in architectural technology, she has been featured in media outlets such as &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;, the BBC, and &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rafi Segal&lt;/strong&gt; has been promoted to full professor. An award-winning designer, Segal works across architectural and urban scales, with projects ranging from Villa 003 in the ORDOS 100 series to the Kitgum Peace Museum in Uganda, the Ashdod Museum of Art in Israel, and the winning design proposal for the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem. His current work includes planning a new communal neighborhood for an Israeli kibbutz and curating the first exhibition on Alfred Neumann’s 1960s architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carlo Ratti&lt;/strong&gt; has been reappointed as professor of the practice. Ratti is the director of the Senseable City Lab and a founding partner of the international design office Carlo Ratti Associati. He has co-authored over 500 publications and holds several patents. His work has been exhibited globally, including at the Venice Biennale, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and the Design Museum in Barcelona. Two of his projects, the Digital Water Pavilion and the Copenhagen Wheel, were named among &lt;em&gt;TIME Magazine&lt;/em&gt;’s “Best Inventions of the Year.” He is the curator of the 2025 Venice Biennale’s 19th International Architecture Exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Albert Saiz&lt;/strong&gt; has been promoted to full professor.

            &lt;p&gt;Seven faculty in the MIT School of Architecture and Planning (SA+P) have been honored for their contributions through promotions, effective July 1. Three faculty promotions are in the Department of Architecture; three are in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning; and one is in the Program in Media Arts and Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether architects, urbanists, computer scientists, or nanotechnologists, they represent our school at its best, in its breadth of inquiry and mission to improve the relationship between human beings and their environments,” says SA+P Dean Hashim Sarkis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Department of Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcelo Coelho&lt;/strong&gt; has been promoted to associate professor of the practice. Coelho is the director of the Design Intelligence Lab, which explores the intersection of human and machine intelligence across design, AI, and fabrication. His work ranges from light-based installations to physical computing. Recognition for his work includes two Prix Ars Electronica awards and &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;’s Innovation by Design Award. Coelho’s experimental approach redefines creative processes, transforming how we imagine and interact with intelligent systems. Coelho teaches courses that bring together industrial design, user experience, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holly Samuelson&lt;/strong&gt; has been promoted to associate professor without tenure. Samuelson has co-authored over 40 peer-reviewed papers, winning a Best Paper award from the journal &lt;em&gt;Energy and Building.&lt;/em&gt; As a recognized expert in architectural technology, she has been featured in media outlets such as &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;, the BBC, and &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rafi Segal&lt;/strong&gt; has been promoted to full professor. An award-winning designer, Segal works across architectural and urban scales, with projects ranging from Villa 003 in the ORDOS 100 series to the Kitgum Peace Museum in Uganda, the Ashdod Museum of Art in Israel, and the winning design proposal for the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem. His current work includes planning a new communal neighborhood for an Israeli kibbutz and curating the first exhibition on Alfred Neumann’s 1960s architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carlo Ratti&lt;/strong&gt; has been reappointed as professor of the practice. Ratti is the director of the Senseable City Lab and a founding partner of the international design office Carlo Ratti Associati. He has co-authored over 500 publications and holds several patents. His work has been exhibited globally, including at the Venice Biennale, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and the Design Museum in Barcelona. Two of his projects, the Digital Water Pavilion and the Copenhagen Wheel, were named among &lt;em&gt;TIME Magazine&lt;/em&gt;’s “Best Inventions of the Year.” He is the curator of the 2025 Venice Biennale’s 19th International Architecture Exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Albert Saiz&lt;/strong&gt; has been promoted to full professor. Saiz serves as the director of MIT’s Urban Economics Lab, which conducts research on real estate economics, urban economics, housing markets, local public finance, zoning regulations, global real estate, and demographic trends affecting urban and real estate development worldwide. He also contributes to the broader research community as a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, a research fellow at the Institute for the Analysis of Labor, and editor for the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Housing Economics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delia Wendel&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;has been promoted to associate professor without tenure.

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Dozens of xAI employees expressed concerns—and many objected—when asked to record videos of their facial expressions to help "give Grok a face," Business Insider reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BI reviewed internal documents and Slack messages, finding that the so-called project "Skippy" was designed to help Grok learn what a face is and "interpret human emotions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear from these documents if workers' facial data helped train controversial avatars that xAI released last week, including Ani—an anime companion that flirts and strips—and Rudi—a red panda with a "Bad" mode that encourages violence. But a recording of an xAI introductory meeting on "Skippy" showed a lead engineer confirming the company "might eventually use" the employees' facial data to build out "avatars of people," BI reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although all employees were told that their training videos would not be shared outside the company and would be used "solely" for training, some workers refused to sign the consent form, worried their likenesses might be used to say things they never said. Likely xAI's recent Grok scandals—where the chatbot went on antisemitic rants praising Hitler—and xAI's reported plan to hire an engineer to design "AI-powered anime girls for people to fall in love with" contributed to employees' discomfort. Confirming on Slack that they opted out, these employees were ultimately too "uneasy" granting xAI "perpetual" access to their data, BI found.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;For the more than 200 employees who did not opt out, xAI asked that they record 15- to 30-minute conversations, where one employee posed as the potential Grok user and the other posed as the "host." xAI was specifically looking for "imperfect data," BI noted, expecting that only training on crystal-clear videos would limit Grok's ability to interpret a wider range of facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI's goal was to help Grok "recognize and analyze facial movements and expressions, such as how people talk, react to others' conversations, and express themselves in various conditions," an internal document said. Allegedly among the only guarantees to employees—who likely recognized how sensitive facial data is—was a promise "not to create a digital version of you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of data submitted by "Skippy" participants, dubbed tutors, xAI recommended that they never provide one-word answers, always ask follow-up questions, and maintain eye contact throughout the conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also apparently provided scripts to evoke facial expressions they wanted Grok to understand, suggesting conversation topics like "How do you secretly manipulate people to get your way?" or "Would you ever date someone with a kid or kids?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For xAI employees who provided facial training data, privacy concerns may still exist, considering X—the social platform formerly known as Twitter that recently was folded into xAI—has recently been targeted by what Elon Musk called a "massive" cyberattack. Because of privacy risks ranging from identity theft to government surveillance, several states have passed strict biometric privacy laws to prevent companies from collecting such data without explicit consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI did not respond to Ars' request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Dozens of xAI employees expressed concerns—and many objected—when asked to record videos of their facial expressions to help "give Grok a face," Business Insider reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BI reviewed internal documents and Slack messages, finding that the so-called project "Skippy" was designed to help Grok learn what a face is and "interpret human emotions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear from these documents if workers' facial data helped train controversial avatars that xAI released last week, including Ani—an anime companion that flirts and strips—and Rudi—a red panda with a "Bad" mode that encourages violence. But a recording of an xAI introductory meeting on "Skippy" showed a lead engineer confirming the company "might eventually use" the employees' facial data to build out "avatars of people," BI reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although all employees were told that their training videos would not be shared outside the company and would be used "solely" for training, some workers refused to sign the consent form, worried their likenesses might be used to say things they never said. Likely xAI's recent Grok scandals—where the chatbot went on antisemitic rants praising Hitler—and xAI's reported plan to hire an engineer to design "AI-powered anime girls for people to fall in love with" contributed to employees' discomfort. Confirming on Slack that they opted out, these employees were ultimately too "uneasy" granting xAI "perpetual" access to their data, BI found.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;For the more than 200 employees who did not opt out, xAI asked that they record 15- to 30-minute conversations, where one employee posed as the potential Grok user and the other posed as the "host." xAI was specifically looking for "imperfect data," BI noted, expecting that only training on crystal-clear videos would limit Grok's ability to interpret a wider range of facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI's goal was to help Grok "recognize and analyze facial movements and expressions, such as how people talk, react to others' conversations, and express themselves in various conditions," an internal document said. Allegedly among the only guarantees to employees—who likely recognized how sensitive facial data is—was a promise "not to create a digital version of you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of data submitted by "Skippy" participants, dubbed tutors, xAI recommended that they never provide one-word answers, always ask follow-up questions, and maintain eye contact throughout the conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also apparently provided scripts to evoke facial expressions they wanted Grok to understand, suggesting conversation topics like "How do you secretly manipulate people to get your way?" or "Would you ever date someone with a kid or kids?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For xAI employees who provided facial training data, privacy concerns may still exist, considering X—the social platform formerly known as Twitter that recently was folded into xAI—has recently been targeted by what Elon Musk called a "massive" cyberattack. Because of privacy risks ranging from identity theft to government surveillance, several states have passed strict biometric privacy laws to prevent companies from collecting such data without explicit consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI did not respond to Ars' request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

The series also highlights the NVIDIA software and hardware powering advanced AI agents, which form the foundation of AI query engines that gather insights and perform tasks to transform everyday experiences and reshape industries.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With advancements in agentic AI, intelligent AI systems are maturing to now facilitate autonomous decision-making across industries, including financial services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, customer service-related use of generative AI, including chatbots and AI assistants, has more than doubled in financial services, rising from 25% to 60%. Organizations are using AI to automate time-intensive tasks like document processing and report generation, driving significant cost savings and operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to NVIDIA’s latest State of AI in Financial Services report, more than 90% of respondents reported a positive impact on their organization’s revenue from AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI agents are versatile, capable of adapting to complex tasks that require strict protocols and secure data usage. They can help with an expanding list of use cases, from enabling better investment decisions by automatically identifying portfolio optimization strategies to ensuring regulatory alignment and compliance automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where AI Agents Offer the Most Value in Financial Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve market returns and business performance, AI agents are being adopted in various areas that benefit greatly from autonomous decision-making backed by data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevated Customer Service Experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the State of AI in Financial Services report, 60% of respondents said customer experience and engagement was the top use case for generative AI. Businesses using AI have already seen customer experiences improve by 26%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI agents can help automate repetitive tasks while providing next steps, such as dispute resolution and know-your-customer updates. This reduces operational costs and helps minimize human errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By handling customer inquiries and forms, AI chatbots scale support and ensure 24/7 availability, enhancing customer satisfaction. Employees can focus on higher-level, judgment-based cases, rather than performing case intake, data analysis and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Fraud Detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, AI agents are crucial for fraud detection, as they can detect and respond to suspicious transactions automatically. The State of AI report highlighted that out of 20 use cases, cybersecurity experienced the highest growth over the last year, with more than a third of respondents now assessing or investing in AI for cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI closes the time gap between detection and action, as a lack of action can result in significant financial loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat fraud, AI agents can monitor transaction patterns in real time, learn from new types of fraud and take immediate action by alerting compliance teams or freezing suspicious accounts — all without the need for human intervention. Plus, teams of AI agents can work with other systems to retrieve additional data, simulate potential fraud scenarios and investigate abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Digital Payments and Banking Transactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI agents make financial management easier, especially for bill payment and cash flow management. Because agentic AI supports machine-to-machine interactions in digital ecosystems, it can ensure regulatory compliance by automatically maintaining detailed audit trails. This reduces compliance costs and processing time, making it easier for financial institutions to operate in complex regulatory environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligent Document Processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For capital markets, the most powerful investment insights are often hidden in unstructured text data from everyday document sources such as news articles, blogs and SEC filings. AI agents can accelerate intelligent document processing (IDP) to provide insight and investment recommendations for traders, enabling faster decision-making and reducing the risk of financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In consumer banking, handling documents like loan records, regulatory filings and transaction records involves a lot of complex data. This amount of data is so large that it can be difficult and time-consuming to process and understand it manually. IDP helps solve this issue, using AI to identify document types, summarize documents, employ retrieval-augmented generation for answers and support, and organize data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data-driven insights from multi-agent systems inform strategic business decisions as these systems continuously learn from customer and institutional data using a data flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of AI Agents in Financial Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many industry customers and partners have benefited significantly from integrating AI into their workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, BlackRock uses Aladdin, a proprietary platform that unifies investment management processes across public and private markets for institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With numerous Aladdin applications and thousands of specialized users, the BlackRock team identified an opportunity to use AI to streamline the platform’s user experience while fostering connectivity and operational efficiency. Rapidly and securely, BlackRock has bolstered the Aladdin platform with advanced AI through Aladdin Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a federated development model, where different teams can work on AI agents independently while building on a common foundation, BlackRock’s central AI team established a standardized communication system and plug-in registry. This allows the firm’s developers and data scientists to create and deploy AI agents tailored to their specific areas, improving intelligence and efficiency for clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is bunq’s generative AI platform, Finn, which offers users a range of features to help manage finances through an in-app chatbot. It can answer questions about money, provide insight into spending habits and offer tips on using the bunq app. Finn uses advanced AI to improve its responses based on feedback and, beyond the in-app chatbot, now handles over 90% of all users’ support tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One is also assisting customers with Chat Concierge, its multi-agent conversational AI assistant designed to enhance the automotive-buying experience. Consumers have 24/7 access to agents that provide real-time information and take action based on user requests. In a single conversation, Chat Concierge can perform tasks like comparing vehicles to help car buyers find their ideal choice and scheduling test drives or appointments with a sales team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC’s latest platform for global research, Aiden, uses internal agents to automatically perform analysis when companies covered by RBC Capital Markets release SEC filings. Aiden has an orchestration agent working with other agents, such as the SEC filing agent, earnings agent and a real-time news agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing an AI-Powered Finance Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building blocks of a powerful financial services agent include:&lt;/p&gt;

The series also highlights the NVIDIA software and hardware powering advanced AI agents, which form the foundation of AI query engines that gather insights and perform tasks to transform everyday experiences and reshape industries.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With advancements in agentic AI, intelligent AI systems are maturing to now facilitate autonomous decision-making across industries, including financial services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, customer service-related use of generative AI, including chatbots and AI assistants, has more than doubled in financial services, rising from 25% to 60%. Organizations are using AI to automate time-intensive tasks like document processing and report generation, driving significant cost savings and operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to NVIDIA’s latest State of AI in Financial Services report, more than 90% of respondents reported a positive impact on their organization’s revenue from AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI agents are versatile, capable of adapting to complex tasks that require strict protocols and secure data usage. They can help with an expanding list of use cases, from enabling better investment decisions by automatically identifying portfolio optimization strategies to ensuring regulatory alignment and compliance automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where AI Agents Offer the Most Value in Financial Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve market returns and business performance, AI agents are being adopted in various areas that benefit greatly from autonomous decision-making backed by data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevated Customer Service Experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the State of AI in Financial Services report, 60% of respondents said customer experience and engagement was the top use case for generative AI. Businesses using AI have already seen customer experiences improve by 26%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI agents can help automate repetitive tasks while providing next steps, such as dispute resolution and know-your-customer updates. This reduces operational costs and helps minimize human errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By handling customer inquiries and forms, AI chatbots scale support and ensure 24/7 availability, enhancing customer satisfaction. Employees can focus on higher-level, judgment-based cases, rather than performing case intake, data analysis and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Fraud Detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, AI agents are crucial for fraud detection, as they can detect and respond to suspicious transactions automatically. The State of AI report highlighted that out of 20 use cases, cybersecurity experienced the highest growth over the last year, with more than a third of respondents now assessing or investing in AI for cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI closes the time gap between detection and action, as a lack of action can result in significant financial loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat fraud, AI agents can monitor transaction patterns in real time, learn from new types of fraud and take immediate action by alerting compliance teams or freezing suspicious accounts — all without the need for human intervention. Plus, teams of AI agents can work with other systems to retrieve additional data, simulate potential fraud scenarios and investigate abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Digital Payments and Banking Transactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI agents make financial management easier, especially for bill payment and cash flow management. Because agentic AI supports machine-to-machine interactions in digital ecosystems, it can ensure regulatory compliance by automatically maintaining detailed audit trails. This reduces compliance costs and processing time, making it easier for financial institutions to operate in complex regulatory environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligent Document Processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For capital markets, the most powerful investment insights are often hidden in unstructured text data from everyday document sources such as news articles, blogs and SEC filings. AI agents can accelerate intelligent document processing (IDP) to provide insight and investment recommendations for traders, enabling faster decision-making and reducing the risk of financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In consumer banking, handling documents like loan records, regulatory filings and transaction records involves a lot of complex data. This amount of data is so large that it can be difficult and time-consuming to process and understand it manually. IDP helps solve this issue, using AI to identify document types, summarize documents, employ retrieval-augmented generation for answers and support, and organize data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data-driven insights from multi-agent systems inform strategic business decisions as these systems continuously learn from customer and institutional data using a data flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of AI Agents in Financial Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many industry customers and partners have benefited significantly from integrating AI into their workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, BlackRock uses Aladdin, a proprietary platform that unifies investment management processes across public and private markets for institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With numerous Aladdin applications and thousands of specialized users, the BlackRock team identified an opportunity to use AI to streamline the platform’s user experience while fostering connectivity and operational efficiency. Rapidly and securely, BlackRock has bolstered the Aladdin platform with advanced AI through Aladdin Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a federated development model, where different teams can work on AI agents independently while building on a common foundation, BlackRock’s central AI team established a standardized communication system and plug-in registry. This allows the firm’s developers and data scientists to create and deploy AI agents tailored to their specific areas, improving intelligence and efficiency for clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is bunq’s generative AI platform, Finn, which offers users a range of features to help manage finances through an in-app chatbot. It can answer questions about money, provide insight into spending habits and offer tips on using the bunq app. Finn uses advanced AI to improve its responses based on feedback and, beyond the in-app chatbot, now handles over 90% of all users’ support tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One is also assisting customers with Chat Concierge, its multi-agent conversational AI assistant designed to enhance the automotive-buying experience. Consumers have 24/7 access to agents that provide real-time information and take action based on user requests. In a single conversation, Chat Concierge can perform tasks like comparing vehicles to help car buyers find their ideal choice and scheduling test drives or appointments with a sales team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC’s latest platform for global research, Aiden, uses internal agents to automatically perform analysis when companies covered by RBC Capital Markets release SEC filings. Aiden has an orchestration agent working with other agents, such as the SEC filing agent, earnings agent and a real-time news agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing an AI-Powered Finance Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building blocks of a powerful financial services agent include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multimodal and Multi-Query Capabilities: &lt;/b&gt;These agents can process and respond to queries that combine text and images, making search processes more versatile and user-friendly. They can also easily be extended to support other modalities such as voice.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p&gt;We leverage a dataset with 40 million hours of wearable data sampled from over 60,000 participants during the period from March to May 2024. The dataset was thoroughly anonymized or de-identified to ensure that participant information was removed and privacy was maintained. Subjects wore a variety of Fitbit and Google Pixel smartwatches and trackers and consented for their data to be used for research and development of new health and wellness products and services. The subjects were asked to self-report sex, age, and weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pre-train LSM-2, we employ the AIM SSL technique introduced in the previous section. AIM implements a masked reconstruction training objective, and learns to understand data that is naturally missing, and impute data that is artificially masked. This unified framework allows LSM-2 to learn the underlying structure (including missingness) inherent in wearable sensor data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We curate a set of downstream tasks to evaluate the pre-trained model, using meta-data that was collected alongside the sensor signals for the purposes of research and development. These include user annotated activities from a set of 20 different categories (such as running, skiing, kayaking and playing golf) and self-reported diagnoses of hypertension and anxiety. These data were split into fine-tuning and evaluation sets where data from each individual was only in either the tuning or the evaluation set and not both. Data from individuals used in the pretraining stage was also not included in the fine-tuning or evaluation stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generative capabilities of LSM-2 are evaluated through the tasks of random imputation, temporal interpolation, temporal extrapolation (forecasting), and sensor imputation, described in our LSM-1 work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The utility of the LSM-2 embeddings are evaluated via linear probe on a number of discriminative tasks. Specifically we gauge the applicability of the LSM-2 embeddings to the tasks of binary hypertension classification, binary anxiety classification, and 20-class activity recognition.

You want a model that’s smart and powerful, but you also don’t want to remortgage your house to pay for the API calls. And if your app needs to be fast for users, a slow, churning model is a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google says Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is quicker than their previous speedy models, which is a big claim. For anyone building a real-time translator, a customer service chatbot, or anything where a lag would feel awkward, this is huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the price.

You want a model that’s smart and powerful, but you also don’t want to remortgage your house to pay for the API calls. And if your app needs to be fast for users, a slow, churning model is a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google says Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is quicker than their previous speedy models, which is a big claim. For anyone building a real-time translator, a customer service chatbot, or anything where a lag would feel awkward, this is huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the price. At $0.10 to process a million words of input and $0.40 for the output, it’s ridiculously cheap. This is the kind of pricing that changes how you think about development.

That’s the driving force behind Michigan-based startup Enspired Solutions, founded by environmental toxicologist Denise Kay and chemical engineer Meng Wang. The duo left corporate consulting in the rearview mirror to take on one of the most pervasive environmental challenges: PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;"PFAS is referred to as a forever chemical because it is so resistant to break down,” says Kay. “It does not break down naturally in the environment, so it just circles around and around. This chemistry, which would break that cycle and break the molecule apart, could really support the health of all of us.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basing the company in Michigan was both a strategic and a practical strategy. The state has been a leader in PFAS regulation with a startup infrastructure—buoyed by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC)—that helped turn an ambitious vision into a viable business.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From intellectual property analyses to forecasting finances and fundraising guidance, the MEDC’s programs offered Kay and Wang the resources to focus on building their PFASigator: a machine the size of two large refrigerators that uses ultraviolet light and chemistry to break down PFAS in water. In other words, “it essentially eats PFAS.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Despite the support from the MEDC, the journey has been far from smooth. "As people say, being an entrepreneur and running a startup is like a rollercoaster,” Kay says. “You have high moments, and you have very low moments when you think nothing's ever going to move forward."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without revenue or salaries in the early days, the co-founders had to be sustained by something greater than financial incentive.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"If problem solving and learning new talents do not provide sufficient intrinsic reward for a founder to be satisfied throughout what I guarantee will be a long duration effort, then that founder may need to reset their expectations. Because the financial rewards of entrepreneurship are small throughout the process."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, Kay remains optimistic about the road ahead for Enspired Solutions, for clean water innovation, and for other founders walking down a similar path. "Often, founders are coached about formulas for fundraising, formulas for startup success. Learning those formulas and expectations is important, but it's also important to not forget that it's your creativity and innovation and foresight that got you to the place you're in and drove you to start a company. Ultimately, people still want to see that shine through."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan Tatum:&lt;/em&gt; From MIT Technology Review, I'm Megan Tatum. This is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today's episode is brought to you in partnership with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our topic today is launching a technology startup in the US state of Michigan. Building out an innovative idea into a viable product and company requires knowledge and resources that individuals might not have. That's why the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, or the MEDC, has launched an innovation campaign to support technology entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two words for you: startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My guest is Dr. Denise Kay, the co-founder and CEO at Enspired Solutions, a Michigan-based startup focused on removing synthetic forever chemicals called PFAS from water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome, Denise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Denise Kay:&lt;/em&gt; Hi, Megan.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Hi. Thank you so much for joining us. To get us started, Denise, I wondered if we could talk about Enspired Solutions a bit more. How did the idea come about, and what does your company do?&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Well, my co-founder, Meng, and I had careers in consulting, advising clients on the fate and toxicity of chemicals in the environment. What we did was evaluate how chemicals moved through soil, water, and air, and what toxic impact they might have on humans and wildlife. That put us in a really unique position to see early on&amp;nbsp;the environmental and health ramifications of the manmade chemical PFAS in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we learned of a very novel and elegant chemistry that could effectively destroy PFAS, we could foresee the value in making this chemistry available for commercial use and the potential for a significant positive impact on maintaining healthy water resources for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like you mentioned, PFAS is referred to as a forever chemical because it is so resistant to break down. It does not break down naturally in the environment, so it just circles around and around. This chemistry, which would break that cycle and break the molecule apart, could really support the health of all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Meng and I quit our jobs, and we founded Enspired Solutions. Our objective was to design, manufacture, and sell commercial-scale equipment that destroys PFAS in water based on this laboratory bench-scale chemistry that had been discovered, the goal being that this toxic contaminant does not continue to circulate in our natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, we have won an award from the EPA and Department of Defense, and proven our technology in over 200 different water samples ranging from groundwater, surface water, landfill leachate, industrial wastewater, [and] municipal wastewater. It's really everywhere. What we're seeing traction in right now is customer applications managing semiconductor waste. Groundwater and surface water around airports tend to be high in PFAS. Centralized waste disposal facilities that collect and manage PFAS-contaminated liquids. And also, even transitioning firetrucks to PFAS-free firefighting foams.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan: &lt;/em&gt;Fantastic. That's a huge breadth of applications, incredible stuff.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan: &lt;/em&gt;You launched about four years ago now. I wondered what factors made Michigan the right place to build and grow the company?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; That is something we put a lot of thought into, because I live in Michigan, and Meng lives in Illinois, so when it was just the two of us, there was even that, "Okay, what is going to be our headquarters?" We looked at a number of factors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the things we considered were rentable incubator space. By incubator, I mean startup incubators or innovation centers. The startup support network, a pool of future employees, and what position the state agencies were taking regarding PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While thinking about all those things and investigating our communities, in Michigan, we found a space to rent where we could do chemistry experiments in an incubator environment. Somewhere where we were surrounded by other entrepreneurs, which we knew was something we had to learn how to do. We were great chemists, but we knew that surrounding ourselves with those skills that could be a gap for us was going to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, we know that Michigan has moved much faster than other states in identifying PFAS sources in the environment and regulating its presence. This combination was something we knew would be the right place for starting our business and having success.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; It was a perfect setting for those two reasons. What were the first stages of your journey working with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the MEDC?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Well, both my co-founder, Meng, and I are first-time entrepreneurs. MEDC was one of the first resources I reached out to, starting from a Google search. They were an information resource we turned to initially, and then again and again for learning some fundamental skills. And receiving one-on-one expert mentorship for things like business contracts, understanding intellectual property landscapes, tracking and forecasting our business finances, and even how to approach fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Wow. It sounds like they were an invaluable resource in those early days. How did early-stage research and development progress from that point? What were the key MEDC services and programs you used to get started?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Well, our business is based on cutting-edge science, truly cutting-edge science. Understanding the intellectual property landscape, which is a term used to describe intellectual property, patents, trademarks, trade secrets that are related to the science we were founding our business on, it was very important. So that we knew we were starting on a path, that we wouldn't hit a wall three years from now.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The MEDC performed an IP landscape survey for us. They searched the breadth of patents, and patent applications, and trademarks, and those things, and provided that for Meng and me to review and consider our position before really, really digging in and spending a lot of emotional time and money on the business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The MEDC also helped us early on create a model in Excel for tracking business financing and forecasting, forecasting our future financial needs, so that we could be proactive instead of reactive to financial limitations. We knew it wasn't going to be inexpensive to design and build a piece of equipment that's the size of two very large refrigerators that had never been built before. That type of financial-forward modeling helped us figure out when we would need to start fundraising and taking in investments. As we progressed along that, the MEDC also provided support of an attorney who reviewed contract language to make sure that we really understood various agreements that we were signing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Right. You mentioned that you and your co-founder were first-time entrepreneurs, as you put it. Tech acumen and business acumen are very different sets of skills. I wondered, what was the process like, developing this innovative technology&amp;nbsp;while also building out a viable business plan?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Well, Meng is a brilliant individual. She is a chemical engineer who also has an MBA. Meng had fantastic training to help understand the basis of how businesses function, in addition to understanding both the engineering and the chemistry behind what we were trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am an environmental toxicologist by training. I've had a longer career than Meng in that field. Over time, I have grown new offices and&amp;nbsp;established new offices for different consulting firms I've worked for. I had the experience with people, space, culture, and running a business from that side. Meng has the financial MBA knowledge basis for a business. We're both excellent chemists and engineers, and those types of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had much of the necessary knowledge, at least to take the first steps forward. The challenge became the hard limit of 24 hours in a day and no revenue to hire any support. That's when the startup support networks like the MEDC became invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was simply impossible to do everything that needed to be done, especially while we were learning what we were doing. The MEDC and other programs provided support to take some of that load off us, but also helped us to learn to implement the new skills in an efficient manner, less stumbling.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan: &lt;/em&gt;So many things to juggle, isn't there, in starting a company. I wondered, in that vein, could you share some successes and highlights from your journey so far? Any partnerships or projects that you're excited about that you could share with us?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; As people say, being an entrepreneur and running a startup is like a rollercoaster. You have high moments and you have very low moments when you think nothing's ever going to move forward. I'd love to talk about some of the highlights. Our machine, which we call the PFASigator.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First of all, coming up with that name has a fun story behind it. The machine is, like I said, about the size of two large refrigerators. It's very large, and it breaks down PFAS in water. The machine takes in water that has PFAS in it, we add a couple of liquid chemicals, then&amp;nbsp;a very intense ultraviolet light shines on that water, which catalyzes a chemical reaction called reductive defluorination. When all of this is happening and the PFAS molecules are being broken apart to nontoxic compounds, to an outsider, it all still just looks like water with a light shining on it. But the machine is big, and it essentially eats PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meng and I were bantering, and her young, six-year-old son was in the background at the time. We were throwing names around. Thomas called out, "The PFASigator!" We were like, "Ooh, there's something there."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; It's a great name.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; It matches what we do, and it's a memorable name. We've really had fun with that throughout. That was an early highlight, and we've stuck with that name.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The next highlight I'd say was standing next to our first fully functioning PFASigator. It was big. It was all stainless steel. Meng and I had never been part of building a physical, large object like that. Just standing there, and the picture we have of us, it was exhilarating. That was a magnificent feeling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Selling our first machine was a day that everyone in the company, I think we were about eight at that point, received a bottle of champagne.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise: &lt;/em&gt;For a startup to go from zero to one, they call it, you've sold nothing to you've sold something. That's a real strong milestone and was a celebration for us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I'd say most recently, Enspired has been awarded a very exciting project in Michigan. It is in the contracting phase, so I can't reveal too many details. But it is with a progressive municipality that will have our PFASigator permanently installed, destroying PFAS. That kind of movement from zero to one, and then a significant contract that will raise the visibility of the effectiveness of our approach and machine, has really buoyed our energy and is pushing us forward. It's amazing to know we are now having an impact on the sustainability of water resources. That's what we started the company for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Awesome. You have some incredible milestones there. But it's a hard journey, as you've said as well, being an entrepreneur. I wondered, finally, what advice would you offer to burgeoning entrepreneurs given your own experience?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; I would advise that if problem solving and learning new talents do not provide sufficient intrinsic reward for a founder to be satisfied throughout what I guarantee will be a long duration effort, then that founder may need to reset their expectations, because the financial rewards of entrepreneurship are small throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meng and I put [in] some of our personal funds and took no salary, and worked harder than we ever had in our lives for at least a year and a half before we were able to take a small salary. The financial rewards are small throughout the process of being a startup. The rewards are delayed, and in many cases, for many startups, the financial rewards never materialize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a tough journey, and you have to love being on that journey, and be intrinsically rewarded for that for the sake of the journey itself, or you'll be a very unhappy founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; It needs to be something you're as passionate about as I can tell you are about the work you're doing at Enspired Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; There's probably one other thing I'd like to add to that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Of course.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Often, founders are coached about formulas for fundraising, formulas for startup success. Learning those formulas and expectations is important, but it's also important to not forget that it's your creativity and innovation and foresight that got you to the place you're in and drove you to start a company. Ultimately, people still want to see that shine through."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; That's fantastic advice. Thank you so much, Denise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That was Dr. Denise Kay, the co-founder and CEO at Enspired Solutions, whom I spoke with from an unexpectedly sunny Brighton, England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's it for this episode of Business Lab.

That’s the driving force behind Michigan-based startup Enspired Solutions, founded by environmental toxicologist Denise Kay and chemical engineer Meng Wang. The duo left corporate consulting in the rearview mirror to take on one of the most pervasive environmental challenges: PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;"PFAS is referred to as a forever chemical because it is so resistant to break down,” says Kay. “It does not break down naturally in the environment, so it just circles around and around. This chemistry, which would break that cycle and break the molecule apart, could really support the health of all of us.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basing the company in Michigan was both a strategic and a practical strategy. The state has been a leader in PFAS regulation with a startup infrastructure—buoyed by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC)—that helped turn an ambitious vision into a viable business.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From intellectual property analyses to forecasting finances and fundraising guidance, the MEDC’s programs offered Kay and Wang the resources to focus on building their PFASigator: a machine the size of two large refrigerators that uses ultraviolet light and chemistry to break down PFAS in water. In other words, “it essentially eats PFAS.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Despite the support from the MEDC, the journey has been far from smooth. "As people say, being an entrepreneur and running a startup is like a rollercoaster,” Kay says. “You have high moments, and you have very low moments when you think nothing's ever going to move forward."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without revenue or salaries in the early days, the co-founders had to be sustained by something greater than financial incentive.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"If problem solving and learning new talents do not provide sufficient intrinsic reward for a founder to be satisfied throughout what I guarantee will be a long duration effort, then that founder may need to reset their expectations. Because the financial rewards of entrepreneurship are small throughout the process."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, Kay remains optimistic about the road ahead for Enspired Solutions, for clean water innovation, and for other founders walking down a similar path. "Often, founders are coached about formulas for fundraising, formulas for startup success. Learning those formulas and expectations is important, but it's also important to not forget that it's your creativity and innovation and foresight that got you to the place you're in and drove you to start a company. Ultimately, people still want to see that shine through."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan Tatum:&lt;/em&gt; From MIT Technology Review, I'm Megan Tatum. This is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today's episode is brought to you in partnership with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our topic today is launching a technology startup in the US state of Michigan. Building out an innovative idea into a viable product and company requires knowledge and resources that individuals might not have. That's why the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, or the MEDC, has launched an innovation campaign to support technology entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two words for you: startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My guest is Dr. Denise Kay, the co-founder and CEO at Enspired Solutions, a Michigan-based startup focused on removing synthetic forever chemicals called PFAS from water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome, Denise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Denise Kay:&lt;/em&gt; Hi, Megan.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Hi. Thank you so much for joining us. To get us started, Denise, I wondered if we could talk about Enspired Solutions a bit more. How did the idea come about, and what does your company do?&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Well, my co-founder, Meng, and I had careers in consulting, advising clients on the fate and toxicity of chemicals in the environment. What we did was evaluate how chemicals moved through soil, water, and air, and what toxic impact they might have on humans and wildlife. That put us in a really unique position to see early on&amp;nbsp;the environmental and health ramifications of the manmade chemical PFAS in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we learned of a very novel and elegant chemistry that could effectively destroy PFAS, we could foresee the value in making this chemistry available for commercial use and the potential for a significant positive impact on maintaining healthy water resources for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like you mentioned, PFAS is referred to as a forever chemical because it is so resistant to break down. It does not break down naturally in the environment, so it just circles around and around. This chemistry, which would break that cycle and break the molecule apart, could really support the health of all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Meng and I quit our jobs, and we founded Enspired Solutions. Our objective was to design, manufacture, and sell commercial-scale equipment that destroys PFAS in water based on this laboratory bench-scale chemistry that had been discovered, the goal being that this toxic contaminant does not continue to circulate in our natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, we have won an award from the EPA and Department of Defense, and proven our technology in over 200 different water samples ranging from groundwater, surface water, landfill leachate, industrial wastewater, [and] municipal wastewater. It's really everywhere. What we're seeing traction in right now is customer applications managing semiconductor waste. Groundwater and surface water around airports tend to be high in PFAS. Centralized waste disposal facilities that collect and manage PFAS-contaminated liquids. And also, even transitioning firetrucks to PFAS-free firefighting foams.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan: &lt;/em&gt;Fantastic. That's a huge breadth of applications, incredible stuff.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan: &lt;/em&gt;You launched about four years ago now. I wondered what factors made Michigan the right place to build and grow the company?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; That is something we put a lot of thought into, because I live in Michigan, and Meng lives in Illinois, so when it was just the two of us, there was even that, "Okay, what is going to be our headquarters?" We looked at a number of factors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the things we considered were rentable incubator space. By incubator, I mean startup incubators or innovation centers. The startup support network, a pool of future employees, and what position the state agencies were taking regarding PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While thinking about all those things and investigating our communities, in Michigan, we found a space to rent where we could do chemistry experiments in an incubator environment. Somewhere where we were surrounded by other entrepreneurs, which we knew was something we had to learn how to do. We were great chemists, but we knew that surrounding ourselves with those skills that could be a gap for us was going to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, we know that Michigan has moved much faster than other states in identifying PFAS sources in the environment and regulating its presence. This combination was something we knew would be the right place for starting our business and having success.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; It was a perfect setting for those two reasons. What were the first stages of your journey working with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the MEDC?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Well, both my co-founder, Meng, and I are first-time entrepreneurs. MEDC was one of the first resources I reached out to, starting from a Google search. They were an information resource we turned to initially, and then again and again for learning some fundamental skills. And receiving one-on-one expert mentorship for things like business contracts, understanding intellectual property landscapes, tracking and forecasting our business finances, and even how to approach fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Wow. It sounds like they were an invaluable resource in those early days. How did early-stage research and development progress from that point? What were the key MEDC services and programs you used to get started?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Well, our business is based on cutting-edge science, truly cutting-edge science. Understanding the intellectual property landscape, which is a term used to describe intellectual property, patents, trademarks, trade secrets that are related to the science we were founding our business on, it was very important. So that we knew we were starting on a path, that we wouldn't hit a wall three years from now.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The MEDC performed an IP landscape survey for us. They searched the breadth of patents, and patent applications, and trademarks, and those things, and provided that for Meng and me to review and consider our position before really, really digging in and spending a lot of emotional time and money on the business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The MEDC also helped us early on create a model in Excel for tracking business financing and forecasting, forecasting our future financial needs, so that we could be proactive instead of reactive to financial limitations. We knew it wasn't going to be inexpensive to design and build a piece of equipment that's the size of two very large refrigerators that had never been built before. That type of financial-forward modeling helped us figure out when we would need to start fundraising and taking in investments. As we progressed along that, the MEDC also provided support of an attorney who reviewed contract language to make sure that we really understood various agreements that we were signing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Right. You mentioned that you and your co-founder were first-time entrepreneurs, as you put it. Tech acumen and business acumen are very different sets of skills. I wondered, what was the process like, developing this innovative technology&amp;nbsp;while also building out a viable business plan?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Well, Meng is a brilliant individual. She is a chemical engineer who also has an MBA. Meng had fantastic training to help understand the basis of how businesses function, in addition to understanding both the engineering and the chemistry behind what we were trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am an environmental toxicologist by training. I've had a longer career than Meng in that field. Over time, I have grown new offices and&amp;nbsp;established new offices for different consulting firms I've worked for. I had the experience with people, space, culture, and running a business from that side. Meng has the financial MBA knowledge basis for a business. We're both excellent chemists and engineers, and those types of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had much of the necessary knowledge, at least to take the first steps forward. The challenge became the hard limit of 24 hours in a day and no revenue to hire any support. That's when the startup support networks like the MEDC became invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was simply impossible to do everything that needed to be done, especially while we were learning what we were doing. The MEDC and other programs provided support to take some of that load off us, but also helped us to learn to implement the new skills in an efficient manner, less stumbling.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan: &lt;/em&gt;So many things to juggle, isn't there, in starting a company. I wondered, in that vein, could you share some successes and highlights from your journey so far? Any partnerships or projects that you're excited about that you could share with us?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; As people say, being an entrepreneur and running a startup is like a rollercoaster. You have high moments and you have very low moments when you think nothing's ever going to move forward. I'd love to talk about some of the highlights. Our machine, which we call the PFASigator.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First of all, coming up with that name has a fun story behind it. The machine is, like I said, about the size of two large refrigerators. It's very large, and it breaks down PFAS in water. The machine takes in water that has PFAS in it, we add a couple of liquid chemicals, then&amp;nbsp;a very intense ultraviolet light shines on that water, which catalyzes a chemical reaction called reductive defluorination. When all of this is happening and the PFAS molecules are being broken apart to nontoxic compounds, to an outsider, it all still just looks like water with a light shining on it. But the machine is big, and it essentially eats PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meng and I were bantering, and her young, six-year-old son was in the background at the time. We were throwing names around. Thomas called out, "The PFASigator!" We were like, "Ooh, there's something there."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; It's a great name.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; It matches what we do, and it's a memorable name. We've really had fun with that throughout. That was an early highlight, and we've stuck with that name.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The next highlight I'd say was standing next to our first fully functioning PFASigator. It was big. It was all stainless steel. Meng and I had never been part of building a physical, large object like that. Just standing there, and the picture we have of us, it was exhilarating. That was a magnificent feeling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Selling our first machine was a day that everyone in the company, I think we were about eight at that point, received a bottle of champagne.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise: &lt;/em&gt;For a startup to go from zero to one, they call it, you've sold nothing to you've sold something. That's a real strong milestone and was a celebration for us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I'd say most recently, Enspired has been awarded a very exciting project in Michigan. It is in the contracting phase, so I can't reveal too many details. But it is with a progressive municipality that will have our PFASigator permanently installed, destroying PFAS. That kind of movement from zero to one, and then a significant contract that will raise the visibility of the effectiveness of our approach and machine, has really buoyed our energy and is pushing us forward. It's amazing to know we are now having an impact on the sustainability of water resources. That's what we started the company for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Awesome. You have some incredible milestones there. But it's a hard journey, as you've said as well, being an entrepreneur. I wondered, finally, what advice would you offer to burgeoning entrepreneurs given your own experience?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; I would advise that if problem solving and learning new talents do not provide sufficient intrinsic reward for a founder to be satisfied throughout what I guarantee will be a long duration effort, then that founder may need to reset their expectations, because the financial rewards of entrepreneurship are small throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meng and I put [in] some of our personal funds and took no salary, and worked harder than we ever had in our lives for at least a year and a half before we were able to take a small salary. The financial rewards are small throughout the process of being a startup. The rewards are delayed, and in many cases, for many startups, the financial rewards never materialize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a tough journey, and you have to love being on that journey, and be intrinsically rewarded for that for the sake of the journey itself, or you'll be a very unhappy founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; It needs to be something you're as passionate about as I can tell you are about the work you're doing at Enspired Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; There's probably one other thing I'd like to add to that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Of course.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denise:&lt;/em&gt; Often, founders are coached about formulas for fundraising, formulas for startup success. Learning those formulas and expectations is important, but it's also important to not forget that it's your creativity and innovation and foresight that got you to the place you're in and drove you to start a company. Ultimately, people still want to see that shine through."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; That's fantastic advice. Thank you so much, Denise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That was Dr. Denise Kay, the co-founder and CEO at Enspired Solutions, whom I spoke with from an unexpectedly sunny Brighton, England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's it for this episode of Business Lab.
