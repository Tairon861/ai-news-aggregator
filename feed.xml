&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch Disrupt returns to San Francisco this October 27–29, and we’re calling in the crew to roll up their sleeves and help make it all happen. Whether you’re greeting attendees, supporting speakers, or running backstage ops, volunteering gets you free event access, real-world experience, and direct exposure to the startup scene. It’s a chance to get hands-on learning behind the scenes, discover what’s next in tech, and build valuable connections.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications close September 30, and spots are filling fast.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is your shot to get in the room — not as a guest, but as a vital part of the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply to volunteer at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He was working as a “quant” in his first job out of college. That’s hedge-fund speak for a stock-trading analyst at a statistical-model-driven quant fund. But like many people who spend their energy pursuing ever more money, he felt empty.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“At some point you just want to make a much bigger impact on this world,” Qi, now 29, tells TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So in 2019, he and his high school buddy Omid Rooholfada, along with Ethan Yu (Qi’s friend from college — also working at a hedge fund), built an AI calendaring and task management app and applied to Y Combinator. They were accepted into the Winter 2020 batch and promptly quit their jobs to go be founders. Motion has since added a fourth co-founder, early employee Chander Ramesh.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the next six years, they steadily grew Motion’s mostly professional consumer customer base until, in May, they launched an integrated AI agent bundle for small and midsized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They saw usage of their agent bundle explode. In four months, that segment of their business alone grew to over 10,000 B2B customers and $10 million in ARR, Qi tells TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Their growth led to a 5x oversubscribed $38 million Series C round, led by Stacey Bishop at Scale Venture Partners, and a fast preemptive C2 round at a $550 million post-money valuation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has raised $75 million to date from investors like HOF Capital, 468 Capital, and SignalFire with participation from Valor Equity Partners, Fellows Fund, Leonis Capital, and some other big names, like the Altman brothers’ fund Apollo Projects. Y Combinator has invested in every round as well, Qi says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is doing so well that Ashutosh Desai, Qi’s executive coach from his YC days and a YC adviser, joined as a full-timer as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Motion is specifically geared toward small and midsized businesses (SMBs) that don’t have bazillion-dollar budgets to custom write and train their own agents.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Its appeal is that all agentic functions (each with a different human name) are integrated with the others. So far the suite includes an “executive assistant” for automating scheduling, note taking, email replies; a sales rep; a customer support rep; and a blog- and social-media-post writing marketing assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The agents also integrate with hundreds of other typical SMB tools like Slack, Google Apps, Teams, Salesforce, etc. Motion charges via usage: a base set of credits, plus additional credits as needed, depending on the number of agents used. Prices range from $29 per month for one seat, 1,000 credits and limited agent functions, to $600 for 25 seats and all agents, 250,000 credits. Then custom pricing from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Qi views Motion like building the agentic equivalent of Microsoft Office. “There’s an opportunity here to build the next Microsoft,” he said. “You basically have to build all the applications.” This is in contrast to buying point AI products — a sales rep, a customer service bot, a blog-writing one — that don’t work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the admitted “stress” he endures as a founder building in AI’s fast-changing field, he says he wouldn’t go back to his old life. He’s on a texting-friends basis with many of his customers and every day one of them tells him how Motion makes their lives easier, increases their productivity or revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If I’m answering very honestly, financially speaking, it was still a bad decision. I’d probably be making somewhere between 3 and 10 million a year right now,” he jokes, while also noting that his now middle-class, early-stage founder income is still comfortable. But he also dreams of building an enduring company, like a Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Was this the right path?” He nods, thinking of his customers. “What gets you out of bed is just knowing you actually built something useful.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Motion-founders.jpg?resize=1200,1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;By the time Harry Qi was 23 years old, he had achieved the kind of financial success that most people will never attain: making about $1 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;

Anthropic’s endorsement marks a rare and major win for SB 53, at a time when major tech groups like the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) and Chamber for Progress are lobbying against the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“While we believe that frontier AI safety is best addressed at the federal level instead of a patchwork of state regulations, powerful AI advancements won’t wait for consensus in Washington,” said Anthropic in a blog post. “The question isn’t whether we need AI governance — it’s whether we’ll develop it thoughtfully today or reactively tomorrow. SB 53 offers a solid path toward the former.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If passed, SB 53 would require frontier AI model developers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI to develop safety frameworks, as well as release public safety and security reports before deploying powerful AI models. The bill would also establish whistleblower protections to employees who come forward with safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Senator Wiener’s bill specifically focuses on limiting AI models from contributing to “catastrophic risks,” which the bill defines as the death of at least 50 people or more than a billion dollars in damages. SB 53 focuses on the extreme side of AI risk — limiting AI models from being used to provide expert-level assistance in the creation of biological weapons or being used in cyberattacks — rather than more near-term concerns like AI deepfakes or sycophancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;California’s Senate approved a prior version of SB 53 but still needs to hold a final vote on the bill before it can advance to the governor’s desk. Governor Gavin Newsom has stayed silent on the bill so far, although he vetoed Senator Weiner’s last AI safety bill, SB 1047.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bills regulating frontier AI model developers have faced significant pushback from both Silicon Valley and the Trump administration, which both argue that such efforts could limit America’s innovation in the race against China. Investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator led some of the pushback against SB 1047, and in recent months, the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to block states from passing AI regulation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the most common arguments against AI safety bills are that states should leave the matter up to federal governments. Andreessen Horowitz’s head of AI policy, Matt Perault, and chief legal officer, Jai Ramaswamy, published a blog post last week arguing that many of today’s state AI bills risk violating the Constitution’s Commerce Clause — which limits state governments from passing laws that go beyond their borders and impair interstate commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark argues in a post on X that the tech industry will build powerful AI systems in the coming years and can’t wait for the federal government to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have long said we would prefer a federal standard,” said Clark. “But in the absence of that this creates a solid blueprint for AI governance that cannot be ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer, Chris Lehane, sent a letter to Governor Newsom in August arguing that he should not pass any AI regulation that would push startups out of California — although the letter did not mention SB 53 by name.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s former head of policy research, Miles Brundage, said in a post on X that Lehane’s letter was “filled with misleading garbage about SB 53 and AI policy generally.” Notably, SB 53 aims to solely regulate the world’s largest AI companies — particularly ones that generated a gross revenue of more than $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the criticism, policy experts say SB 53 is a more modest approach than previous AI safety bills. Dean Ball, a senior fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation and former White House AI policy adviser, said in an August blog post that he believes SB 53 has a good chance now of becoming law. Ball, who criticized SB 1047, said SB 53’s drafters have “shown respect for technical reality,” as well as a “measure of legislative restraint.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Senator Wiener previously said that SB 53 was heavily influenced by an expert policy panel Governor Newsom convened — co-led by&amp;nbsp;leading Stanford researcher and co-founder of World Labs, Fei-Fei Li&amp;nbsp;— to advise California on how to regulate AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most AI labs already have some version of the internal safety policy that SB 53 requires. OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic regularly publish safety reports for their models. However, these companies are not bound by anyone but themselves, so sometimes they fall behind their self-imposed safety commitments. SB 53 aims to set these requirements as state law, with financial repercussions if an AI lab fails to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier in September, California lawmakers amended SB 53 to remove a section of the bill that would have required AI model developers to be audited by third parties. Tech companies have previously fought these types of third-party audits in other AI policy battles, arguing that they’re overly burdensome.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1968430987.jpg?resize=1200,799" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Monday, Anthropic announced an official endorsement of SB 53, a California bill from state senator Scott Wiener that would impose first-in-the-nation transparency requirements on the world’s largest AI model developers.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have long said we would prefer a federal standard,” said Clark. “But in the absence of that this creates a solid blueprint for AI governance that cannot be ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer, Chris Lehane, sent a letter to Governor Newsom in August arguing that he should not pass any AI regulation that would push startups out of California — although the letter did not mention SB 53 by name.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s former head of policy research, Miles Brundage, said in a post on X that Lehane’s letter was “filled with misleading garbage about SB 53 and AI policy generally.” Notably, SB 53 aims to solely regulate the world’s largest AI companies — particularly ones that generated a gross revenue of more than $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the criticism, policy experts say SB 53 is a more modest approach than previous AI safety bills. Dean Ball, a senior fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation and former White House AI policy adviser, said in an August blog post that he believes SB 53 has a good chance now of becoming law. Ball, who criticized SB 1047, said SB 53’s drafters have “shown respect for technical reality,” as well as a “measure of legislative restraint.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Senator Wiener previously said that SB 53 was heavily influenced by an expert policy panel Governor Newsom convened — co-led by&amp;nbsp;leading Stanford researcher and co-founder of World Labs, Fei-Fei Li&amp;nbsp;— to advise California on how to regulate AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most AI labs already have some version of the internal safety policy that SB 53 requires. OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic regularly publish safety reports for their models. However, these companies are not bound by anyone but themselves, so sometimes they fall behind their self-imposed safety commitments. SB 53 aims to set these requirements as state law, with financial repercussions if an AI lab fails to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier in September, California lawmakers amended SB 53 to remove a section of the bill that would have required AI model developers to be audited by third parties. Tech companies have previously fought these types of third-party audits in other AI policy battles, arguing that they’re overly burdensome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/anthropic-endorses-californias-ai-safety-bill-sb-53/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 15:51:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Alibaba’s new Qwen model to supercharge AI transcription tools (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/alibaba-new-qwen-model-supercharge-ai-transcription-tools/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;AI speech transcription tools are about to get a lot more competitive with Alibaba’s Qwen team pulling unveiling the Qwen3-ASR-Flash model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built upon the powerful Qwen3-Omni intelligence and trained using a massive dataset with tens of millions of hours of speech data, this isn’t just another AI speech recognition model.

          &lt;p&gt;In five years, you won’t be able to spell IT without AI, Gartner predicted today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VP analysts Alicia Mullery and Daryl Plummer delivered the sentiment at their keynote address at Gartner’s IT Symposium in Gold Coast, Australia, as reported by The Register. Gartner believes that by 2030, all work performed by an IT department will involve the use of AI. That’s a progression from the 81 percent of IT work that’s done today without any use of AI, per Mullery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2030, not only will all IT work rely on AI, but much of it will be performed by bots without the help of humans, Gartner’s analysts said. They predicted that in five years, 25 percent of IT work will be totally performed by bots, while 75 percent of IT workloads will be performed by humans with the help of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a welcome prediction for AI naysayers, who often point to potential job losses as a reason to be dubious about AI. Today, many organizations already use AI to complete tasks that humans had historically performed in other industries, including recruiting, journalism, customer service, and even social media influencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No IT jobs bloodbath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT industry has already prepared for thousands of AI-driven job losses and will likely see more. Eventually, though, AI will be something that everyone in IT will have to become familiar with, if Gartner’s predictions prove correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing role of AI-automated workloads in IT, Gartner doesn’t expect the technology to create an “AI jobs bloodbath,” Plummer said. Currently, only 1 percent of job losses are the result of AI, per Gartner’s numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean there won’t be any AI-related job losses in IT, though. Plummer and Mullery believe that AI will take away entry-level IT jobs. This aligns with some of what we’re already seeing today. According to data from labor research firm Revelio Labs, “highly AI exposed entry-level jobs have declined by over 40 percent” from January 2023 to July 2025. In August, Goldman Sachs Research predicted that AI “could displace 6 to 7 percent of the US workforce if AI is widely adopted,” but noted that the impact would likely be “transitory” as new jobs are created.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With AI changing the way that IT employees work, it's expected to expand the amount of work that IT departments can complete, making it more essential that IT departments can justify their headcounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You never want to look like you have too many people,” Plummer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every industry is still working to understand what impact AI will have on jobs, including the replacement of certain roles. However, there’s also a popular sentiment that AI will ultimately settle into being a helpful tool for employees that enables workers to do more and/or different types of work rather than totally replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some expect that AI will eventually create more jobs than it kills. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 released in January, based on data from 1,000 companies employing 14 million global workers, found that by 2030, AI could create 78 million more jobs than it eliminates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other pressing AI concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s too early to know if AI will end up being positive or negative for job opportunities in IT or otherwise. In the more immediate future, the question is whether organizations are implementing AI in ways that are effective and efficient and that drive improvements for employees and/or customers. During their keynote, Gartner’s analysts highlighted the challenges companies are having in managing AI-related costs and the different AI capabilities coming out. Currently, 65 percent of companies are losing money on AI investments, according to the Gartner research cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly speaking, the average American remains skeptical about AI being able to improve their lives. In a survey of 5,410 Americans that Pew Research Center released in April, 51 percent said they’re more concerned about AI than they are excited. Among the most common concerns cited were job losses, deepfakes, misinformation, and bias.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;In five years, you won’t be able to spell IT without AI, Gartner predicted today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VP analysts Alicia Mullery and Daryl Plummer delivered the sentiment at their keynote address at Gartner’s IT Symposium in Gold Coast, Australia, as reported by The Register. Gartner believes that by 2030, all work performed by an IT department will involve the use of AI. That’s a progression from the 81 percent of IT work that’s done today without any use of AI, per Mullery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2030, not only will all IT work rely on AI, but much of it will be performed by bots without the help of humans, Gartner’s analysts said. They predicted that in five years, 25 percent of IT work will be totally performed by bots, while 75 percent of IT workloads will be performed by humans with the help of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a welcome prediction for AI naysayers, who often point to potential job losses as a reason to be dubious about AI. Today, many organizations already use AI to complete tasks that humans had historically performed in other industries, including recruiting, journalism, customer service, and even social media influencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No IT jobs bloodbath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT industry has already prepared for thousands of AI-driven job losses and will likely see more. Eventually, though, AI will be something that everyone in IT will have to become familiar with, if Gartner’s predictions prove correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing role of AI-automated workloads in IT, Gartner doesn’t expect the technology to create an “AI jobs bloodbath,” Plummer said. Currently, only 1 percent of job losses are the result of AI, per Gartner’s numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean there won’t be any AI-related job losses in IT, though. Plummer and Mullery believe that AI will take away entry-level IT jobs. This aligns with some of what we’re already seeing today. According to data from labor research firm Revelio Labs, “highly AI exposed entry-level jobs have declined by over 40 percent” from January 2023 to July 2025. In August, Goldman Sachs Research predicted that AI “could displace 6 to 7 percent of the US workforce if AI is widely adopted,” but noted that the impact would likely be “transitory” as new jobs are created.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;With AI changing the way that IT employees work, it's expected to expand the amount of work that IT departments can complete, making it more essential that IT departments can justify their headcounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You never want to look like you have too many people,” Plummer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every industry is still working to understand what impact AI will have on jobs, including the replacement of certain roles. However, there’s also a popular sentiment that AI will ultimately settle into being a helpful tool for employees that enables workers to do more and/or different types of work rather than totally replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some expect that AI will eventually create more jobs than it kills. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 released in January, based on data from 1,000 companies employing 14 million global workers, found that by 2030, AI could create 78 million more jobs than it eliminates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other pressing AI concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s too early to know if AI will end up being positive or negative for job opportunities in IT or otherwise. In the more immediate future, the question is whether organizations are implementing AI in ways that are effective and efficient and that drive improvements for employees and/or customers. During their keynote, Gartner’s analysts highlighted the challenges companies are having in managing AI-related costs and the different AI capabilities coming out. Currently, 65 percent of companies are losing money on AI investments, according to the Gartner research cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly speaking, the average American remains skeptical about AI being able to improve their lives. In a survey of 5,410 Americans that Pew Research Center released in April, 51 percent said they’re more concerned about AI than they are excited. Among the most common concerns cited were job losses, deepfakes, misinformation, and bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Monday, Google announced that AI Mode will now support Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese. The update follows last month’s rollout of the AI-powered experience to 180 new markets in English, after initially launching in the U.S. and later expanding to the U.K. and India.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With this expansion, more people can now use AI Mode to ask complex questions in their preferred language, while exploring the web more deeply,” said Hema Budaraju, VP of Product Management at Google Search, in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First rolled out as an experiment to Google One AI Premium subscribers in March, AI Mode is Google’s answer to AI search platforms including Perplexity and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search. The feature utilizes a customized version of Gemini 2.5, featuring multimodal and reasoning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In August, Google introduced agentic features in AI Mode, letting it find restaurant reservations, with support for local service appointments and event ticket bookings planned for the future. These updates are currently limited to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. and are available through the “Agentic capabilities in AI Mode” experiment in Labs. The Ultra tier costs $249.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So far, Google’s AI Mode is accessible via a dedicated tab on the search results page and a button in the search bar. The company appears to be working toward making this AI-led search experience the default “soon,” as indicated by Google DeepMind’s group product manager Logan Kilpatrick, while responding to a user post on X last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s recent AI updates, including AI Mode and AI Overviews, are criticized for affecting search clicks. However, Google last month denied that its AI search features are killing website traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;TechCrunch Disrupt 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, happening October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, Pinecone founder and CEO Edo Liberty will explain why the next wave of AI-native apps won’t be driven by bigger models, but by smarter search. With 10,000+ startup and VC leaders expected to be at Disrupt, &lt;strong&gt;this AI Stage fireside chat&lt;/strong&gt; and presentation is a must-attend session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As AI becomes more embedded in every workflow, the real differentiator isn’t just the algorithm — it’s how you access and use the right data at the right time. Liberty believes that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and purpose-built infrastructure are the next frontier, and search is at the center of it all.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In his session, &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Why the Next Frontier Is Search&lt;em&gt;,”&lt;/em&gt; Liberty will unpack how vector databases and high-performance infrastructure are unlocking the full potential of AI. With so much data in play, knowing how to find what matters — fast — is everything. This talk goes deep into the stack that’s powering smarter, more scalable applications across industries.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Is the web thriving or faltering? Google has an unexpected take in a new legal filing. Google is heading back to court soon in hopes of convincing a judge that it should not have to split up its ad business. The company lost its adtech antitrust case earlier this year, and now it's up to the court to decide on remedies for the illegal conduct. In its response to the Department of Justice's requested remedies, Google made a startling claim: "The fact is that today, the open web is already in rapid decline."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google says that forcing it to divest its AdX marketplace would hasten the demise of wide swaths of the web that are dependent on advertising revenue. This is one of several reasons Google asks the court to deny the government's request. The DOJ also tried to force a divestment of Chrome in the search antitrust trial, but the judge in that case declined to order that in the remedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's advertising business has turned it into an unrivaled Internet juggernaut. Google increasingly is the Internet—websites have no choice but to adhere to Google's standards for search and ads because there's no substantial competition. The court in this case ruled that in tying its display ad services with the AdX marketplace, Google suppressed the adoption of rival technologies, and this gave it an opportunity to preference its own services in ad auctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As users become increasingly frustrated with AI search products, Google often claims people actually love AI search and are sending as many clicks to the web as ever. Now that its golden goose is on the line, the open web is suddenly "in rapid decline." It's right there on page five of the company's September 5 filing, as spotted by Search Engine Roundtable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent analysis of AI Overviews web traffic from the Pew Research Center suggests AI Overviews results in a substantial drop in web traffic. Google executives have disputed this, claiming the search clicks are "relatively stable," according to search head Liz Reid. It feels like Google is trying to have it both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Advertising and the open web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google objects to this characterization. A spokesperson calls it a "cherry-picked" line from the filing that has been misconstrued. Google's position is that the entire passage is referring to open-web &lt;em&gt;advertising&lt;/em&gt; rather than the open web itself. "Investments in non-open web display advertising like connected TV and retail media are growing at the expense of those in open web display advertising," says Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume this is true, it doesn't exactly let Google off the hook. As AI tools have proliferated, we've heard from Google time and time again that traffic from search to the web is healthy. When people use the web more, Google makes more money from all those eyeballs on ads, and indeed, Google's earnings have never been higher. However, Google isn't just putting ads on websites—Google is also big in mobile apps. As Google's own filings make clear, in-app ads are by far the largest growth sector in advertising. Meanwhile, time spent on non-social and non-video content is stagnant or slightly declining, and as a result, display ads on the open web earn less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whether Google's wording in the filing is meant to address the web or advertising on the web may be a distinction without a difference. If ads on websites aren't making the big bucks, Google's incentives will undoubtedly change. While Google says its increasingly AI-first search experience is still consistently sending traffic to websites, it has not released data to show that. If display ads are in "rapid decline," then it's not really in Google's interest to continue sending traffic to non-social and non-video content. Maybe it makes more sense to keep people penned up on its platform where they can interact with its AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the web isn't just ad-supported content—Google representatives have repeatedly trotted out the claim that Google's crawlers have seen a 45 percent increase in indexable content since 2023. This metric, Google says, shows that open web advertising could be imploding while the web is healthy and thriving. We don't know what kind of content is in this 45 percent, but given the timeframe cited, AI slop is a safe bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the increasingly AI-heavy open web isn't worth advertisers' attention, is it really right to claim the web is thriving as Google so often does? Google's filing may simply be admitting to what we all know: the open web is supported by advertising, and ads increasingly can't pay the bills. And is that a thriving web? Not unless you count AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The realization came while reading (and sharing) some posts from the r/Claudecode subreddit, which were praising OpenAI Codex. OpenAI launched the software programming service that takes on Anthropic’s Claude Code in May.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lately, that subreddit has been so filled with posts from self-proclaimed Code users announcing that they moved to Codex that one Reddit user even joked: “Is it possible to switch to codex without posting a topic on Reddit?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This left Altman wondering how many of those posts were from real humans. “I have had the strangest experience reading this: I assume it’s all fake/bots, even though in this case I know codex growth is really strong and the trend here is real,” he confessed on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He then live-analyzed his reasoning. “I think there are a bunch of things going on: real people have picked up quirks of LLM-speak, the Extremely Online crowd drifts together in very correlated ways, the hype cycle has a very ‘it’s so over/we’re so back’ extremism, optimization pressure from social platforms on juicing engagement and the related way that creator monetization works, other companies have astroturfed us so i’m extra sensitive to it, and a bunch more (including probably some bots).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To decode that a little, he’s accusing humans of starting to sound like LLMs, even though LLMs — spearheaded by OpenAI — were literally invented to mimic human communication, right down to the em dash. And OpenAI’s models definitely trained on Reddit, where Altman was a board member through 2022, and was disclosed as a large shareholder during the company’s IPO last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He makes a valid point that fandoms, led by extremely, always-on social media users, do tend to behave in odd ways. Many groups can devolve into hatefests if overrun by those venting frustrations to their brethren. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman also throws a dig at the incentives when social media sites and creators rely on engagement to make money. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But then Altman confesses that one of the reasons he thinks the pro-OpenAI posts in this subreddit might be bots is because OpenAI has also been “astroturfed.” That typically involves posts by people or bots paid for by the competitor, or paid by some third-degree contractor, giving the competitor plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We have no evidence of astroturfing (though it is possible). But we did see how OpenAI subreddits turned on the company after it released GPT 5.0. Instead of waves of praise from the faithful over the new model, many angry posts were voted up. People took to Reddit and X to complain about everything from GPT’s personality to how it burned through credits without finishing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A day after the bumpy release, Altman did a Reddit ask-me-anything session on r/GPT in which he confessed to rollout issues and promised changes. The GPT subreddit has never fully recovered its previous level of love, with users still posting regularly on how much they dislike the changes with GPT 5.0. Are they human? Or are they, as Altman seems to imply, fake in some way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altman surmises, “The net effect is somehow AI twitter/AI Reddit feels very fake in a way it really didn’t a year or two ago.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If that’s true, who’s fault is it? GPT has led models to become so good at writing, that LLMs have become a plague not just to social media sites (which have always had a bot problem) but to schools, journalism, and the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we don’t know how many Reddit posts are written by bots, or are fictional accounts by humans using LLMs, it is likely a substantial number. Data security company Imperva reported that over half of all internet traffic in 2024 was non-human, largely due to LLMs. X’s own bot Grok says: “The exact numbers aren’t public, but 2024 estimates suggest hundreds of millions of bots on X.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several cynics have suggested that Altman’s lament was his first foray into marketing OpenAI’s rumored social media platform. In April, the Verge reported that such a project to take on X and Facebook was at the earliest stages. This product may or may not exist. Altman may or may not have had ulterior motives for suggesting that social media is too fake these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But motives aside, if OpenAI is planning a social network, what are the odds that it would be a bot-free zone? And, funny enough, if it did the reverse and banned humans, the results likely wouldn’t be different. Not only do LLMs still hallucinate facts, but when researchers at the University of Amsterdam built a social network composed entirely of bots, they found that the bots soon formed cliques and echo chambers for themselves, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198379368.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;X enthusiast and Reddit shareholder Sam Altman had an epiphany on Monday: Bots have made it impossible to determine whether social media posts are really written by humans, he posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The realization came while reading (and sharing) some posts from the r/Claudecode subreddit, which were praising OpenAI Codex. OpenAI launched the software programming service that takes on Anthropic’s Claude Code in May.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lately, that subreddit has been so filled with posts from self-proclaimed Code users announcing that they moved to Codex that one Reddit user even joked: “Is it possible to switch to codex without posting a topic on Reddit?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This left Altman wondering how many of those posts were from real humans. “I have had the strangest experience reading this: I assume it’s all fake/bots, even though in this case I know codex growth is really strong and the trend here is real,” he confessed on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He then live-analyzed his reasoning. “I think there are a bunch of things going on: real people have picked up quirks of LLM-speak, the Extremely Online crowd drifts together in very correlated ways, the hype cycle has a very ‘it’s so over/we’re so back’ extremism, optimization pressure from social platforms on juicing engagement and the related way that creator monetization works, other companies have astroturfed us so i’m extra sensitive to it, and a bunch more (including probably some bots).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To decode that a little, he’s accusing humans of starting to sound like LLMs, even though LLMs — spearheaded by OpenAI — were literally invented to mimic human communication, right down to the em dash. And OpenAI’s models definitely trained on Reddit, where Altman was a board member through 2022, and was disclosed as a large shareholder during the company’s IPO last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He makes a valid point that fandoms, led by extremely, always-on social media users, do tend to behave in odd ways. Many groups can devolve into hatefests if overrun by those venting frustrations to their brethren. &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman also throws a dig at the incentives when social media sites and creators rely on engagement to make money. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But then Altman confesses that one of the reasons he thinks the pro-OpenAI posts in this subreddit might be bots is because OpenAI has also been “astroturfed.” That typically involves posts by people or bots paid for by the competitor, or paid by some third-degree contractor, giving the competitor plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We have no evidence of astroturfing (though it is possible). But we did see how OpenAI subreddits turned on the company after it released GPT 5.0. Instead of waves of praise from the faithful over the new model, many angry posts were voted up. People took to Reddit and X to complain about everything from GPT’s personality to how it burned through credits without finishing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A day after the bumpy release, Altman did a Reddit ask-me-anything session on r/GPT in which he confessed to rollout issues and promised changes. The GPT subreddit has never fully recovered its previous level of love, with users still posting regularly on how much they dislike the changes with GPT 5.0. Are they human? Or are they, as Altman seems to imply, fake in some way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altman surmises, “The net effect is somehow AI twitter/AI Reddit feels very fake in a way it really didn’t a year or two ago.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If that’s true, who’s fault is it? GPT has led models to become so good at writing, that LLMs have become a plague not just to social media sites (which have always had a bot problem) but to schools, journalism, and the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we don’t know how many Reddit posts are written by bots, or are fictional accounts by humans using LLMs, it is likely a substantial number. Data security company Imperva reported that over half of all internet traffic in 2024 was non-human, largely due to LLMs. X’s own bot Grok says: “The exact numbers aren’t public, but 2024 estimates suggest hundreds of millions of bots on X.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several cynics have suggested that Altman’s lament was his first foray into marketing OpenAI’s rumored social media platform. In April, the Verge reported that such a project to take on X and Facebook was at the earliest stages. This product may or may not exist. Altman may or may not have had ulterior motives for suggesting that social media is too fake these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But motives aside, if OpenAI is planning a social network, what are the odds that it would be a bot-free zone? And, funny enough, if it did the reverse and banned humans, the results likely wouldn’t be different.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel announced Monday that Michelle Johnston Holthaus will depart the company after more than three decades. Johnston Holthhaus was most recently chief executive officer of Intel products and will remain a strategic adviser.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced the creation of a central engineering group that will build a new custom silicon business for outside customers, according to Intel. This group will be helmed by Srinivasan “Srini” Iyengar who joined Intel from Cadence Design Systems in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel also said that Kevok Kechichian, formerly of ARM, will join the company as head of its data center group. Jim Johnson has been appointed senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s client computing group. Naga Chandrasekaran, the chief technology and operations officer of Intel Foundry, the company’s business unit that builds custom chips for outside customers, is also taking on an expanded role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With Srini leading Central Engineering, we’re aligning innovation and execution more tightly in service to customers,” Tan said in a company press release. “We are laser-focused on delivering world-class products and empowering our engineering teams to move faster and execute with excellence. Kevork, Jim, and Srini are exceptional leaders whose deep technical acumen and industry relationships will be instrumental as we continue building a new Intel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This news comes just a few weeks after the U.S. government announced a plan to convert existing government grants into a 10% stake in Intel. The deal was structured to penalize Intel if the company dropped below 50% ownership of its foundry unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These weren’t the only leadership changes at Intel this year.&lt;/p&gt;
