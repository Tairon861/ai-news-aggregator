Developers routinely rebuild the same models for different hardware targets, losing time to glue code instead of shipping features. The good news is that a shift is underway. Unified toolchains and optimized libraries are making it possible to deploy models across platforms without compromising performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet one critical hurdle remains: software complexity. Disparate tools, hardware-specific optimizations, and layered tech stacks continue to bottleneck progress. To unlock the next wave of AI innovation, the industry must pivot decisively away from siloed development and toward streamlined, end-to-end platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transformation is already taking shape. Major cloud providers, edge platform vendors, and open-source communities are converging on unified toolchains that simplify development and accelerate deployment, from cloud to edge. In this article, we’ll explore why simplification is the key to scalable AI, what’s driving this momentum, and how next-gen platforms are turning that vision into real-world results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The bottleneck: fragmentation, complexity, and inefficiency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue isn’t just hardware variety; it’s duplicated effort across frameworks and targets that slows time-to-value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diverse hardware targets&lt;/b&gt;: GPUs, NPUs, CPU-only devices, mobile SoCs, and custom accelerators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tooling and framework fragmentation&lt;/b&gt;: TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, MediaPipe, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edge constraints&lt;/b&gt;: Devices require real-time, energy-efficient performance with minimal overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3994810"&gt;Gartner Research&lt;/a&gt;, these mismatches create a key hurdle: over 60% of AI initiatives stall before production, driven by integration complexity and performance variability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What software simplification looks like&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplification is coalescing around five moves that cut re-engineering cost and risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cross-platform abstraction layers&lt;/b&gt; that minimize re-engineering when porting models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance-tuned libraries&lt;/b&gt; integrated into major ML frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unified architectural designs&lt;/b&gt; that scale from datacenter to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open standards and runtimes&lt;/b&gt; (e.g., ONNX, MLIR) reducing lock-in and improving compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developer-first ecosystems&lt;/b&gt; emphasizing speed, reproducibility, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts are making AI more accessible, especially for startups and academic teams that previously lacked the resources for bespoke optimization. Projects like Hugging Face’s Optimum and MLPerf benchmarks are also helping standardize and validate cross-hardware performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecosystem momentum and real-world signals&lt;/b&gt; Simplification is no longer aspirational; it’s happening now. Across the industry, software considerations are influencing decisions at the IP and silicon design level, resulting in solutions that are production-ready from day one. Major ecosystem players are driving this shift by aligning hardware and software development efforts, delivering tighter integration across the stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key catalyst is the rapid rise of edge inference, where AI models are deployed directly on devices rather than in the cloud. This has intensified demand for streamlined software stacks that support end-to-end optimization, from silicon to system to application. Companies like Arm are responding by enabling tighter coupling between their compute platforms and software toolchains, helping developers accelerate time-to-deployment without sacrificing performance or portability. The emergence of multi-modal and general-purpose foundation models (e.g., LLaMA, Gemini, Claude) has also added urgency. These models require flexible runtimes that can scale across cloud and edge environments. AI agents, which interact, adapt, and perform tasks autonomously, further drive the need for high-efficiency, cross-platform software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLPerf Inference v3.1 included over 13,500 performance results from 26 submitters, validating multi-platform benchmarking of AI workloads. Results spanned both data center and edge devices, demonstrating the diversity of optimized deployments now being tested and shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these signals make clear that the market’s demand and incentives are aligning around a common set of priorities, including maximizing performance-per-watt, ensuring portability, minimizing latency, and delivering security and consistency at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What must happen for successful simplification&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To realize the promise of simplified AI platforms, several things must occur:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strong hardware/software co-design&lt;/b&gt;: hardware features that are exposed in software frameworks (e.g., matrix multipliers, accelerator instructions), and conversely, software that is designed to take advantage of underlying hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consistent, robust toolchains and libraries&lt;/b&gt;: developers need reliable, well-documented libraries that work across devices. Performance portability is only useful if the tools are stable and well supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open ecosystem&lt;/b&gt;: hardware vendors, software framework maintainers, and model developers need to cooperate. Standards and shared projects help avoid re-inventing the wheel for every new device or use case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstractions that don’t obscure performance&lt;/b&gt;: while high-level abstraction helps developers, they must still allow tuning or visibility where needed. The right balance between abstraction and control is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security, privacy, and trust built in&lt;/b&gt;: especially as more compute shifts to devices (edge/mobile), issues like data protection, safe execution, model integrity, and privacy matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arm as one example of ecosystem-led simplification &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplifying AI at scale now hinges on system-wide design, where silicon, software, and developer tools evolve in lockstep. This approach enables AI workloads to run efficiently across diverse environments, from cloud inference clusters to battery-constrained edge devices. It also reduces the overhead of bespoke optimization, making it easier to bring new products to market faster. Arm (Nasdaq:Arm) is advancing this model with a platform-centric focus that pushes hardware-software optimizations up through the software stack. At &lt;a href="https://newsroom.arm.com/blog/arm-computex-2025?utm_source=vb&amp;amp;utm_medium=sponsored-content&amp;amp;utm_content=longform_txt_na_sw-simplification&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mk30_brand-paid_brand-tl_thirdparty_mediabuy_na"&gt;COMPUTEX 2025&lt;/a&gt;, Arm demonstrated how its latest Arm9 CPUs, combined with AI-specific ISA extensions and the Kleidi libraries, enable tighter integration with widely used frameworks like PyTorch, ExecuTorch, ONNX Runtime, and MediaPipe. This alignment reduces the need for custom kernels or hand-tuned operators, allowing developers to unlock hardware performance without abandoning familiar toolchains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real-world implications are significant. In the data center, Arm-based platforms are delivering improved performance-per-watt, critical for scaling AI workloads sustainably. On consumer devices, these optimizations enable ultra-responsive user experiences and background intelligence that’s always on, yet power efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the industry is coalescing around simplification as a design imperative, embedding AI support directly into hardware roadmaps, optimizing for software portability, and standardizing support for mainstream AI runtimes. Arm’s approach illustrates how deep integration across the compute stack can make scalable AI a practical reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market validation and momentum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.arm.com/blog/half-of-compute-shipped-to-top-hyperscalers-in-2025-will-be-arm-based?utm_source=vb&amp;amp;utm_medium=sponsored-content&amp;amp;utm_content=longform_txt_na_sw-simplification&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mk30_brand-paid_brand-tl_thirdparty_mediabuy_na"&gt;nearly half of the compute shipped to major hyperscalers will run on Arm-based architectures&lt;/a&gt;, a milestone that underscores a significant shift in cloud infrastructure. As AI workloads become more resource-intensive, cloud providers are prioritizing architectures that deliver superior performance-per-watt and support seamless software portability. This evolution marks a strategic pivot toward energy-efficient, scalable infrastructure optimized for the performance and demands of modern AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the edge, Arm-compatible inference engines are enabling real-time experiences, such as live translation and always-on voice assistants, on battery-powered devices. These advancements bring powerful AI capabilities directly to users, without sacrificing energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developer momentum is accelerating as well. In a recent collaboration, GitHub and Arm introduced native Arm Linux and Windows runners for GitHub Actions, streamlining CI workflows for Arm-based platforms. These tools lower the barrier to entry for developers and enable more efficient, cross-platform development at scale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What comes next&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplification doesn’t mean removing complexity entirely; it means managing it in ways that empower innovation. As the AI stack stabilizes, winners will be those who deliver seamless performance across a fragmented landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a future-facing perspective, expect:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benchmarks as guardrails:&lt;/b&gt; MLPerf + OSS suites guide where to optimize next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More upstream, fewer forks:&lt;/b&gt; Hardware features land in mainstream tools, not custom branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Convergence of research + production:&lt;/b&gt; Faster handoff from papers to product via shared runtimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI’s next phase isn’t about exotic hardware; it’s also about software that travels well. When the same model lands efficiently on cloud, client, and edge, teams ship faster and spend less time rebuilding the stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem-wide simplification, not brand-led slogans, will separate the winners. The practical playbook is clear: unify platforms, upstream optimizations, and measure with open benchmarks. &lt;a href="https://www.arm.com/markets/artificial-intelligence/software?utm_source=vb&amp;amp;utm_medium=sponsored-content&amp;amp;utm_content=longform_txt_na_sw-simplification&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mk30_brand-paid_brand-tl_thirdparty_mediabuy_na"&gt;Explore how Arm AI software platforms&lt;/a&gt; are enabling this future — efficiently, securely, and at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

Artificial intelligence is changing these strategies, making them more accurate and efficient. This article examines AI’s impact on link strategies, highlighting current tools and future trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses are always looking for new ways to improve their online presence. Link strategies are the key to boosting SEO rankings, ensuring websites get the visibility they need. With AI integration, businesses can achieve better results by using data-driven insights and automation. This guide explores Bazoom’s backlink building service, showing how it can change traditional methods and help companies prepare for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How AI is reshaping link strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional link strategies often relied on manual processes, like contacting potential partners and tracking backlinks. These methods, while useful, were labour-intensive and prone to error. AI addresses these issues by automating many aspects of link building. Machine learning algorithms allow AI to quickly analyse large data sets, identifying the most relevant linking opportunities for your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using AI technologies, businesses can improve the accuracy of their backlink profiles. AI tools can predict which links will most impact search rankings based on historical data and current trends. The predictive ability helps businesses allocate resources more effectively and focus on high-value opportunities. Besides accuracy, AI saves time by automating repetitive tasks, allowing professionals to focus on strategy development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-enhanced link strategies offer benefits beyond efficiency and accuracy. The technologies provide insights into competitive landscapes, helping businesses understand their position relative to competitors. By gaining a comprehensive market view, companies can make informed decisions about their link building efforts and adapt quickly to changes in search engine algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI tools that enhance link strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, various AI tools significantly improve link building processes. Tools use machine learning to identify data patterns that may not be immediately apparent to humans. Features like automated outreach, relationship management, and real-time analytics streamline the process from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI tools offer more than automation. They provide actionable insights that help optimise link strategies for maximum impact. By analysing competitor links and industry trends, the tools offer strategic recommendations tailored to specific business needs. Integrating such technology enables tracking and reporting, providing visibility into each campaign’s effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For businesses aiming to stay competitive in SEO, implementing advanced tools is essential. They simplify complex processes and ensure every decision is backed by solid data analysis. The ability to forecast potential outcomes allows companies to adjust their strategies proactively rather than reactively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical uses of AI in link strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI’s practical applications in link strategies are diverse. For example, businesses can automate their backlink initiatives by using tools that facilitate efficient outreach and engagement with potential partners. The automation ensures consistent and targeted communication without overwhelming resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI’s impact on data analysis is significant; it transforms raw data into valuable insights that drive decision-making in SEO campaigns. By identifying patterns and predicting search engine trends, AI helps businesses optimise their link building efforts effectively. The capability ensures companies remain competitive in a constantly changing digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, AI enables businesses to predict future industry trends accurately. By forecasting shifts in consumer behaviour or search engine algorithm changes, companies can adjust their strategies accordingly and maintain a competitive edge. The proactive approach reduces the risk associated with sudden changes in SEO dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Future trends in AI and link building practices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several emerging trends suggest further integration between AI technologies and digital marketing efforts. One notable tendency is the increased use of natural language processing (NLP) in SEO tools, allowing for better understanding of contextually relevant content creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential for AI integration extends beyond improving existing systems; it offers opportunities for creating new marketing paradigms through collaborative approaches in various platforms like social media channels or content management systems. As these technologies continue to advance, expect more innovation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While predicting what’s around the corner can be challenging, one thing is clear: embracing technology advances will be crucial for success. Adopting cutting-edge solutions now ensures readiness for whatever comes next, and provides a foundation for sustainable growth in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Smaller tunnels capable of speeds up to 300 miles per hour were built first, followed by a massive 40-by-80-foot tunnel for full-scale aircraft. Powered up in March 1941, these tunnels became vital after Pearl Harbor, helping scientists rapidly develop advanced aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, NASA Ames operates the world’s largest pressurized wind tunnel, with subsonic and transonic chambers for testing rockets, aircraft, and wind turbines.&lt;/p&gt;

They’ve been a critical part of IVF for decades, but their job has gotten a whole lot busier in recent years as demand for the fertility treatment skyrockets and clinics struggle to keep up. The United States is in fact facing a critical shortage of both embryologists and genetic counselors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Klaus Wiemer, a veteran embryologist and IVF lab director, believes artificial intelligence might help by predicting embryo health in real time and unlocking new avenues for productivity in the lab.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wiemer is the chief scientific officer and head of clinical affairs at Fairtility, a company that uses artificial intelligence to shed light on the viability of eggs and embryos before proceeding with IVF. The company’s algorithm, called CHLOE (for Cultivating Human Life through Optimal Embryos), has been trained on millions of embryo data points and outcomes and can quickly sift through a patient’s embryos to point the clinician to the ones with the highest potential for successful implantation. This, the company claims, will improve time to pregnancy and live births. While its effectiveness has been tested only retrospectively to date, CHLOE is the first and only FDA-approved AI tool for embryo assessment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Current challenge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When a patient undergoes IVF, the goal is to make genetically normal embryos. Embryologists collect cells from each embryo and send them off for external genetic testing. The results of this biopsy can take up to two weeks, and the process can add thousands of dollars to the treatment cost. Moreover, passing the screen just means an embryo has the correct number of chromosomes. That number doesn’t necessarily reflect the overall health of the embryo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“An embryo has one singular function, and that is to divide,” says Wiemer. “There are millions of data points concerning embryo cell division, cell division characteristics, area and size of the inner cell mass, and the number of times the trophectoderm [the layer that contributes to the future placenta] contracts.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AI model allows for a group of embryos to be constantly measured against the optimal characteristics at each stage of development. “What CHLOE answers is: How well did that embryo develop? And does it have all the necessary components that are needed in order to make a healthy implantation?” says Wiemer. CHLOE produces an AI score reflecting all the analysis that’s been done within an embryo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In the near future, Wiemer says, reducing the percentage of abnormal embryos that IVF clinics transfer to patients should not require a biopsy: “Every embryology laboratory will be doing automatic assessments of embryo development.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A changing field&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wiemer, who started his career in animal science, says the difference between animal embryology and human embryology is the extent of paperwork. “Embryologists spend 40% of their time on non-embryology skills,” he adds. “AI will allow us to declutter the embryology field so we can get back to being true scientists.” This means spending more time studying the embryos, ensuring that they are developing normally, and using all that newfound information to get better at picking which embryos to transfer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“CHLOE is like having a virtual assistant in the lab to help with embryo selection, ensure conditions are optimal, and send out reports to patients and clinical staff,” he says. “Getting to study data and see what impacts embryo development is extremely rewarding, given that this capability was impossible a few years ago.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amanda Smith is a freelance journalist and writer reporting on culture, society, human interest, and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/250917_MIT-Feature_JobTitlesOfTheFuture_Stork-Illustration-thumb.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Embryologists are the scientists behind the scenes of in vitro fertilization who oversee the development and selection of embryos, prepare them for transfer, and maintain the lab environment.

While its effectiveness has been tested only retrospectively to date, CHLOE is the first and only FDA-approved AI tool for embryo assessment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Current challenge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When a patient undergoes IVF, the goal is to make genetically normal embryos. Embryologists collect cells from each embryo and send them off for external genetic testing. The results of this biopsy can take up to two weeks, and the process can add thousands of dollars to the treatment cost. Moreover, passing the screen just means an embryo has the correct number of chromosomes. That number doesn’t necessarily reflect the overall health of the embryo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“An embryo has one singular function, and that is to divide,” says Wiemer. “There are millions of data points concerning embryo cell division, cell division characteristics, area and size of the inner cell mass, and the number of times the trophectoderm [the layer that contributes to the future placenta] contracts.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AI model allows for a group of embryos to be constantly measured against the optimal characteristics at each stage of development. “What CHLOE answers is: How well did that embryo develop? And does it have all the necessary components that are needed in order to make a healthy implantation?” says Wiemer. CHLOE produces an AI score reflecting all the analysis that’s been done within an embryo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In the near future, Wiemer says, reducing the percentage of abnormal embryos that IVF clinics transfer to patients should not require a biopsy: “Every embryology laboratory will be doing automatic assessments of embryo development.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A changing field&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wiemer, who started his career in animal science, says the difference between animal embryology and human embryology is the extent of paperwork. “Embryologists spend 40% of their time on non-embryology skills,” he adds. “AI will allow us to declutter the embryology field so we can get back to being true scientists.” This means spending more time studying the embryos, ensuring that they are developing normally, and using all that newfound information to get better at picking which embryos to transfer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“CHLOE is like having a virtual assistant in the lab to help with embryo selection, ensure conditions are optimal, and send out reports to patients and clinical staff,” he says. “Getting to study data and see what impacts embryo development is extremely rewarding, given that this capability was impossible a few years ago.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amanda Smith is a freelance journalist and writer reporting on culture, society, human interest, and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/22/1125367/ai-embryologist-reproduction-future-jobs/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] 3 Things Stephanie Arnett is into right now (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/22/1125356/3-things-stephanie-arnett/</link><description>&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dungeon Crawler Carl&lt;/em&gt;, by Matt Dinniman&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125634" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/71agPjqADHL._UF10001000_QL80_.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This science fiction book series confronted me with existential questions like “Are we alone in the universe?” and “Do I actually like LitRPG??” (LitRPG&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;which stands for “literary role-playing game”&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;is a relatively new genre that merges the conventions of computer RPGs with those of science fiction and fantasy novels.)

But, hooking AI up like this also opens up new security risks, not in the AI itself, but in how it’s all connected. This means CIOs and CISOs need to think about a new problem: keeping the data stream that feeds AI safe, just like they protect the AI itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-ai-attacks-targeting-protocols-like-mcp-are-so-dangerous"&gt;Why AI attacks targeting protocols like MCP are so dangerous&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI models – no matter if they’re on Google, Amazon, or running on local devices – have a basic problem: they don’t know what’s happening right now. They only know what they were trained on. They don’t know what code a programmer is working on or what’s in a file on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boffins at Anthropic created the MCP to fix this. MCP is a way for AI to connect to the real world, letting it safely use local data and online services. It’s what lets an assistant like Claude understand what this means when you point to a piece of code and ask it to rework this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, JFrog’s research shows that a certain way of using MCP has a prompt hijacking weakness that can turn this dream AI tool into a nightmare security problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that a programmer asks an AI assistant to recommend a standard Python tool for working with images. The AI should suggest &lt;em&gt;Pillow&lt;/em&gt;, which is a good and popular choice. But, because of a flaw (CVE-2025-6515) in the &lt;em&gt;oatpp-mcp&lt;/em&gt; system, someone could sneak into the user’s session. They could send their own fake request and the server would treat it like it came from the real user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the programmer gets a bad suggestion from the AI assistant recommending a fake tool called &lt;em&gt;theBestImageProcessingPackage&lt;/em&gt;. This is a serious attack on the software supply chain. Someone could use this prompt hijacking to inject bad code, steal data, or run commands, all while looking like a helpful part of the programmer’s toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-mcp-prompt-hijacking-attack-works"&gt;How this MCP prompt hijacking attack works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prompt hijacking attack messes with the way the system communicates using MCP, rather than the security of the AI itself. The specific weakness was found in the Oat++ C++ system’s MCP setup, which connects programs to the MCP standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is in how the system handles connections using Server-Sent Events (SSE). When a real user connects, the server gives them a session ID. However, the flawed function uses the computer’s memory address of the session as the session ID. This goes against the protocol’s rule that session IDs should be unique and cryptographically secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a bad design because computers often reuse memory addresses to save resources. An attacker can take advantage of this by quickly creating and closing lots of sessions to record these predictable session IDs. Later, when a real user connects, they might get one of these recycled IDs that the attacker already has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the attacker has a valid session ID, they can send their own requests to the server. The server can’t tell the difference between the attacker and the real user, so it sends the malicious responses back to the real user’s connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if some programs only accept certain responses, attackers can often get around this by sending lots of messages with common event numbers until one is accepted. This lets the attacker mess up the model’s behaviour without changing the AI model itself. Any company using &lt;em&gt;oatpp-mcp&lt;/em&gt; with HTTP SSE enabled on a network that an attacker can access is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-should-ai-security-leaders-do"&gt;What should AI security leaders do?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of this MCP prompt hijacking attack is a serious warning for all tech leaders, especially CISOs and CTOs, who are building or using AI assistants. As AI becomes more and more a part of our workflows through protocols like MCP, it also gains new risks. Keeping the area around the AI safe is now a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though this specific CVE affects one system, the idea of prompt hijacking is a general one. To protect against this and similar attacks, leaders need to set new rules for their AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, make sure all AI services use secure session management. Development teams need to make sure servers create session IDs using strong, random generators. This should be a must-have on any security checklist for AI programs. Using predictable identifiers like memory addresses is not okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, strengthen the defenses on the user side. Client programs should be designed to reject any event that doesn’t match the expected IDs and types.

But, hooking AI up like this also opens up new security risks, not in the AI itself, but in how it’s all connected. This means CIOs and CISOs need to think about a new problem: keeping the data stream that feeds AI safe, just like they protect the AI itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-ai-attacks-targeting-protocols-like-mcp-are-so-dangerous"&gt;Why AI attacks targeting protocols like MCP are so dangerous&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI models – no matter if they’re on Google, Amazon, or running on local devices – have a basic problem: they don’t know what’s happening right now. They only know what they were trained on. They don’t know what code a programmer is working on or what’s in a file on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boffins at Anthropic created the MCP to fix this. MCP is a way for AI to connect to the real world, letting it safely use local data and online services. It’s what lets an assistant like Claude understand what this means when you point to a piece of code and ask it to rework this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, JFrog’s research shows that a certain way of using MCP has a prompt hijacking weakness that can turn this dream AI tool into a nightmare security problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that a programmer asks an AI assistant to recommend a standard Python tool for working with images. The AI should suggest &lt;em&gt;Pillow&lt;/em&gt;, which is a good and popular choice. But, because of a flaw (CVE-2025-6515) in the &lt;em&gt;oatpp-mcp&lt;/em&gt; system, someone could sneak into the user’s session. They could send their own fake request and the server would treat it like it came from the real user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the programmer gets a bad suggestion from the AI assistant recommending a fake tool called &lt;em&gt;theBestImageProcessingPackage&lt;/em&gt;. This is a serious attack on the software supply chain. Someone could use this prompt hijacking to inject bad code, steal data, or run commands, all while looking like a helpful part of the programmer’s toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-mcp-prompt-hijacking-attack-works"&gt;How this MCP prompt hijacking attack works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prompt hijacking attack messes with the way the system communicates using MCP, rather than the security of the AI itself. The specific weakness was found in the Oat++ C++ system’s MCP setup, which connects programs to the MCP standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is in how the system handles connections using Server-Sent Events (SSE). When a real user connects, the server gives them a session ID. However, the flawed function uses the computer’s memory address of the session as the session ID. This goes against the protocol’s rule that session IDs should be unique and cryptographically secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a bad design because computers often reuse memory addresses to save resources. An attacker can take advantage of this by quickly creating and closing lots of sessions to record these predictable session IDs. Later, when a real user connects, they might get one of these recycled IDs that the attacker already has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the attacker has a valid session ID, they can send their own requests to the server. The server can’t tell the difference between the attacker and the real user, so it sends the malicious responses back to the real user’s connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if some programs only accept certain responses, attackers can often get around this by sending lots of messages with common event numbers until one is accepted. This lets the attacker mess up the model’s behaviour without changing the AI model itself. Any company using &lt;em&gt;oatpp-mcp&lt;/em&gt; with HTTP SSE enabled on a network that an attacker can access is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-should-ai-security-leaders-do"&gt;What should AI security leaders do?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of this MCP prompt hijacking attack is a serious warning for all tech leaders, especially CISOs and CTOs, who are building or using AI assistants. As AI becomes more and more a part of our workflows through protocols like MCP, it also gains new risks. Keeping the area around the AI safe is now a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though this specific CVE affects one system, the idea of prompt hijacking is a general one. To protect against this and similar attacks, leaders need to set new rules for their AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, make sure all AI services use secure session management. Development teams need to make sure servers create session IDs using strong, random generators. This should be a must-have on any security checklist for AI programs. Using predictable identifiers like memory addresses is not okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, strengthen the defenses on the user side. Client programs should be designed to reject any event that doesn’t match the expected IDs and types. Simple, incrementing event IDs are at risk of spraying attacks and need to be replaced with unpredictable identifiers that don’t collide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, use zero-trust principles for AI protocols. Security teams need to check the entire AI setup, from the basic model to the protocols and middleware that connect it to data. These channels need strong session separation and expiration, like the session management used in web applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This MCP prompt hijacking attack is a perfect example of how a known web application problem, session hijacking, is showing up in a new and dangerous way in AI. Securing these new AI tools means applying these strong security basics to stop attacks at the protocol level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How AI adoption is moving IT operations from reactive to proactive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-109805" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
