In this context, interest in AI-driven money management tools is rising. One in five respondents describe themselves as curious about using AI to manage their finances, while a further 12% say they are excited by the prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite the interest in using AI in this context, confidence in personal financial management remains weak. More than a third of respondents (37%) report struggling with self-discipline around money, with impulse spending frequently undermining savings goals. Four in five believe they could improve their financial knowledge, pointing to a gap between intention and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults aged 28 to 34 are around 15% more satisfied with their savings than those aged 35 to 40, and save around 33% more each month on average. The findings suggest that as people move through early adulthood, financial strain accumulates while access to effective, ongoing support does not increase at the same rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI in money management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is being seen as a tool that might help regain financial control. Many respondents express comfort with using AI for routine financial tasks. Nearly two-thirds (64%) would trust AI to advise on disposable income, while more than half would allow AI to move money to avoid overdrafts (54%) or manage regular bill payments (52%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleo’s CEO and founder, Barney Hussey-Yeo, states structural economic pressures are a major factor. Rising living costs, stagnant pay, low wages, and debt mean that many people are not mismanaging money so much as not having enough to make managing it worthwhile. In this context, AI tools positioned as practical, everyday assistance that can work with highly limited funds at its disposal rather than a tool for aspirational financial planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger respondents are driving adoption. Adults aged 28 to 34 are 8% more confident than those aged 35 to 40 in using AI-powered financial tools. However, trust remains a barrier: nearly a quarter of respondents (23%) prefer to begin with limited use of the technology and need evidence of value before significant engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also highlights the regional disparities evident in the UK. Average monthly savings in the affluent South are 26% higher than in the North. Londoners save 33% more than the national average and around £250 more per month than those in Norwich. London (£431), Brighton (£401) and Edinburgh (£386) report the highest average monthly savings, while Newcastle (£185) and Cardiff in Wales (£184.95) sit at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Implications for fintech decision-makers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest signal in this evidence is not enthusiasm for AI per se, but demand for support under financial stress. High proportions citing poor self-discipline (37%) and low confidence in financial knowledge (80%) indicate that execution is the second problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust is a gating factor rather than a secondary concern. While headline willingness to delegate tasks such as overdraft avoidance is high, nearly a quarter of users want incremental proof before committing. This would favour modular product design and specific implementations in software rather than full automation from the outset. Evidence suggests adoption will be earned through demonstrated utility, not brand positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-related divergence within a relatively narrow cohort (28–40) is notable. The sharp drop in savings satisfaction and contribution among those aged 35–40 (the time of life when most take on more responsibilities and financial burden) suggests that fintechs targeting young professionals only might miss those with materially different needs. For older millennials, tools that address cumulative obligations (housing, dependants, legacy debt, bills) are likely to be more relevant..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regional savings disparities are large and persistent, with London outliers (where mean income is higher) masking much weaker savings capacity elsewhere. This weakens the case for nationally uniform products. Pricing, thresholds, nudges in the form of notifications and in-app messages may need regional bias if products are to feel realistic outside higher-income urban centres in the South of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Iced tea at Georgia’s” by Ed Yourdon is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The challenge is no longer whether AI can help, but how tightly it needs to be built into research and clinical work to improve decisions around trials and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That question helps explain why AstraZeneca is bringing Modella AI in-house. The company has agreed to acquire the Boston-based AI firm as it looks to deepen its use of AI across oncology research and clinical development. Financial terms were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than treating AI as a supporting tool, AstraZeneca is pulling Modella’s models, data, and staff directly into its research organisation. The move reflects a broader shift in the drug industry, where partnerships are giving way to acquisitions as companies try to gain more control over how AI is built, tested, and used in regulated settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-ai-ownership-is-starting-to-matter-in-drug-research"&gt;Why AI ownership is starting to matter in drug research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modella AI focuses on using computers to analyse pathology data, such as biopsy images, and link those findings with clinical information. Its work centres on making pathology more quantitative, helping researchers spot patterns that may point to useful biomarkers or guide treatment choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Modella said its foundation models and AI agents would be integrated into AstraZeneca’s oncology research and development work, with a focus on clinical development and biomarker discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-astrazeneca-moved-its-ai-partnership-toward-full-integration"&gt;How AstraZeneca moved its AI partnership toward full integration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For AstraZeneca, the deal builds on a collaboration that began several years ago. That earlier partnership allowed both sides to test whether Modella’s tools could work within the drugmaker’s research environment. According to AstraZeneca executives, the experience made it clear that closer integration was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, AstraZeneca Chief Financial Officer Aradhana Sarin described the acquisition as a way to bring more data and AI capability inside the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oncology drug development is becoming more complex, more data-rich and more time-sensitive,” said Gabi Raia, Modella AI’s chief commercial officer, adding that joining AstraZeneca would allow the company to deploy its tools across global trials and clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-using-ai-to-improve-trial-decisions"&gt;Using AI to improve trial decisions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarin said the deal would “supercharge” AstraZeneca’s work in quantitative pathology and biomarker discovery by combining data, models, and teams under one roof. While such language reflects ambition, the practical goal is more grounded: shortening the time it takes to turn research data into decisions that affect trial design and patient selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area where AstraZeneca expects AI to have an impact is in choosing patients for clinical trials. Better matching patients to studies could improve trial outcomes and reduce costs tied to delays or failed studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of improvement depends less on complex algorithms and more on steady access to clean data and tools that fit into existing workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-talent-and-tools-move-in-house"&gt;Talent and tools move in-house&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition also highlights a change in how large pharmaceutical firms think about AI talent. Rather than relying on outside vendors, companies are increasingly treating data scientists and machine learning experts as part of their core research teams. For AstraZeneca, bringing Modella’s staff in-house reduces dependence on external roadmaps and gives the company more say over how tools are adapted as research needs change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca said this is the first time a major pharmaceutical company has acquired an AI firm outright, though collaborations between drugmakers and technology companies have become common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-astrazeneca-joins-a-crowded-field-of-pharma-ai-deals"&gt;AstraZeneca joins a crowded field of pharma–AI deals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same healthcare conference, several new partnerships were announced, including a $1 billion collaboration between Nvidia and Eli Lilly to build a new research lab using Nvidia’s latest AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those deals point to growing interest in AI across the sector, but they also underline a key difference in strategy. Partnerships can speed up experimentation, while acquisitions suggest a longer-term bet on building internal capability. For companies operating under strict regulatory rules, that control can matter as much as raw computing power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-astrazeneca-is-betting-on-next"&gt;What AstraZeneca is betting on next&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarin described the earlier AstraZeneca–Modella partnership as a “test drive,” saying the company ultimately wanted Modella’s data, models, and people inside the organisation. The aim, she said, is to support the development of “highly targeted biomarkers and then highly targeted therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Modella deal, Sarin said 2026 is expected to be a busy year for AstraZeneca, with several late-stage trial results due across different therapy areas. The company is also working toward a target of $80 billion in annual revenue by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether acquisitions like this help meet those goals will depend on execution. Integrating AI into drug development is slow, expensive, and often messy. Still, AstraZeneca’s move signals a clear view of where it thinks the value lies: not in buying AI as a service, but in embedding it deeply into how medicines are discovered and tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Mika Baumeister)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Allister Frost: Tackling workforce anxiety for AI integration success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

A single facility can cover millions of square feet, built with millions of pounds of steel, aluminum, and concrete; feature hundreds of miles of wiring, connecting some hundreds of thousands of high-end GPU chips, and chewing through hundreds of megawatt-hours of electricity. These facilities run so hot from all that computing power that their cooling systems are triumphs of engineering complexity in themselves. But the star of the show are those chips with their advanced processors. A single chip in these vast arrays can cost upwards of $30,000. Racked together and working in concert, they process hundreds of thousands of tokens—the basic building blocks of an AI model—per second.

The purplest of purple states. A state with both woke liberal cities and MAGA magnified suburbs and rural areas. The state of Stacey Abrams and Newt Gingrich. If there is one thing just about everyone there seemingly agrees on, it’s that they’ve &lt;em&gt;had it&lt;/em&gt; with data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, the state’s Public Service Commission election became unexpectedly tight, and wound up delivering a stunning upset to incumbent Republican commissioners. Although there were likely shades of national politics at play (voters favored Democrats in an election cycle where many things went that party’s way), the central issue was skyrocketing power bills. And that power bill inflation was oft-attributed to a data center building boom rivaled only by Virginia’s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This boom did not come out of the blue. At one point, Georgia wanted data centers. Or at least, its political leadership did. In 2018 the state’s General Assembly passed legislation that provided data centers with tax breaks for their computer systems and cooling infrastructure, more tax breaks for job creation, and even more tax breaks for property taxes. And then… boom!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But things have not played out the way the Assembly and other elected officials may have expected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Journey with me now to Bolingbroke, Georgia. Not far outside of Atlanta, in Monroe County (population 27,954), county commissioners were considering rezoning 900 acres of land to make room for a new data center near the town of Bolingbroke (population 492). Data centers have been popping up all across the state, but especially in areas close to Atlanta. Public opinion is, often enough, irrelevant. In nearby Twiggs County, despite strong and organized opposition, officials decided to allow a 300-acre data center to move forward. But at a packed meeting to discuss the Bolingbroke plans, some 900 people showed up to voice near unanimous opposition to the proposed data center, according to Macon, Georgia’s The Telegraph. Seeing which way the wind had blown, the Monroe county commission shot it down in August last year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The would-be developers of the proposed site had claimed it would bring in millions of dollars for the county. That it would be hidden from view. That it would “uphold the highest environmental standards.” That it would bring jobs and prosperity. Yet still, people came gunning for it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why!? Data centers have been around for years. So why does everyone hate them all of the sudden?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;What is it about these engineering marvels that will allow us to build AI that will cure all diseases, bring unprecedented prosperity, and even cheat death (if you believe what the AI sellers are selling) that so infuriates their prospective neighbors?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are some obvious reasons. First is just the speed and scale of their construction, which has had effects on power grids. No one likes to see their power bills go up. The rate hikes that so incensed Georgians come as monthly reminders that the eyesore in your backyard profits California billionaires at your expense, on your grid. In Wyoming, for example, a planned Meta data center will require more electricity than every household in the state, combined. To meet demand for power-hungry data centers, utilities are adding capacity to the grid. But although that added capacity may benefit tech companies, the cost is shared by local consumers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are environmental concerns. To meet their electricity needs, data centers often turn to dirty forms of energy. xAI, for example, famously threw a bunch of polluting methane-powered generators at its data center in Memphis. While nuclear energy is oft-bandied about as a greener solution, traditional plants can take a decade or more to build; even new and more nimble reactors will take years to come online. In addition, data centers often require massive amounts of water. But the amount can vary widely depending on the facility, and is often shrouded in secrecy. (A number of states are attempting to require facilities to disclose water usage.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A different type of environmental consequence of data centers is that they are noisy. A low, constant, machine hum. Not just sometimes, but always. 24 hours a day. 365 days a year. “A highway that never stops.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as to the jobs they bring to communities. Well, I have some bad news there too. Once construction ends, they tend to employ very few people, especially for such resource-intensive facilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are all logical reasons to oppose data centers. But I suspect there is an additional, emotional one. And it echoes one we’ve heard before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More than a decade ago, the large tech firms of Silicon Valley began operating buses to ferry workers to their campuses from San Francisco and other Bay Area cities. Like data centers, these buses used shared resources such as public roads without, people felt, paying their fair share. Protests erupted. But while the protests were certainly about shared resource use, they were also about something much bigger.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tech companies, big and small, were transforming San Francisco. The early 2010s were a time of rapid gentrification in the city. And what’s more, the tech industry itself was transforming society. Smartphones were newly ubiquitous. The way we interacted with the world was fundamentally changing, and people were, for the most part, powerless to do anything about it. You couldn’t stop Google.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But you could stop a Google bus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You could stand in front of it and block its path. You could yell at the people getting on it. You could yell at your elected officials and tell them to do something. And in San Francisco, people did. The buses were eventually regulated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The data center pushback has a similar vibe. AI, we are told, is transforming society. It is suddenly everywhere. Even if you opt not to use ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini, generative AI is&amp;nbsp; increasingly built into just about every app and service you likely use. People are worried AI will harvest jobs in the coming years. Or even kill us all. And for what? So far, the returns have certainly not lived up to the hype.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can’t stop Google. But maybe, just maybe, you can stop a Google data center.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then again, maybe not. The tech buses in San Francisco, though regulated, remain commonplace. And the city is more gentrified than ever. Meanwhile, in Monroe County, life goes on. In October, Google confirmed it had purchased 950 acres of land just off the interstate. It plans to build a data center there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/3D83KF4.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Behold, the hyperscale data center!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Massive structures, with thousands of specialized computer chips running in parallel to perform the complex calculations required by advanced AI models. A single facility can cover millions of square feet, built with millions of pounds of steel, aluminum, and concrete; feature hundreds of miles of wiring, connecting some hundreds of thousands of high-end GPU chips, and chewing through hundreds of megawatt-hours of electricity. These facilities run so hot from all that computing power that their cooling systems are triumphs of engineering complexity in themselves. But the star of the show are those chips with their advanced processors. A single chip in these vast arrays can cost upwards of $30,000. Racked together and working in concert, they process hundreds of thousands of tokens—the basic building blocks of an AI model—per second. Ooooomph.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI.

The purplest of purple states. A state with both woke liberal cities and MAGA magnified suburbs and rural areas. The state of Stacey Abrams and Newt Gingrich. If there is one thing just about everyone there seemingly agrees on, it’s that they’ve &lt;em&gt;had it&lt;/em&gt; with data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, the state’s Public Service Commission election became unexpectedly tight, and wound up delivering a stunning upset to incumbent Republican commissioners. Although there were likely shades of national politics at play (voters favored Democrats in an election cycle where many things went that party’s way), the central issue was skyrocketing power bills. And that power bill inflation was oft-attributed to a data center building boom rivaled only by Virginia’s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This boom did not come out of the blue. At one point, Georgia wanted data centers. Or at least, its political leadership did. In 2018 the state’s General Assembly passed legislation that provided data centers with tax breaks for their computer systems and cooling infrastructure, more tax breaks for job creation, and even more tax breaks for property taxes.
