&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Internally, this was not controversial,” von Ahn told The New York Times. “Externally, as a publicly traded company some people assume that it’s just for profit. Or that we’re trying to lay off humans. And that was not the intent at all.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the contrary, von Ahn said the company has “never laid off any full-time employees” and has no intention of doing so. And while he didn’t deny that Duolingo had cut its contractor workforce, he suggested that “from the beginning … our contractor workforce has gone up and down depending on needs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the criticism (which does not seem to have made a big impact on Duolingo’s bottom line), von Ahn still sounds extremely bullish about A.I.’s potential, with Duolingo team members taking every Friday morning to experiment with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a bad acronym, f-r-A-I-days,” he said. “I don’t know how to pronounce it.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/duolingo-ai.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;While Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn was loudly criticized this year after declaring that Duolingo would become an “AI-first company,” he suggested in a new interview the real issue was that he “did not give enough context.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company recently launched the much-anticipated GPT-5 in a process that CEO Sam Altman admitted was “a little more bumpy than we’d hoped for,” with some users complaining that they preferred the previous model, GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is trying to address some of those complaints with this update, with changes that it says are “subtle” but will make GPT-5 “more approachable now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You’ll notice small, genuine touches like ‘Good question’ or ‘Great start,’ not flattery,” the company wrote in a social media post. “Internal tests show no rise in sycophancy compared to the previous GPT-5 personality.“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At a dinner this week with journalists, OpenAI executives tried to focus on the company’s plans beyond GPT-5, but as Max Zeff reports, the rocky launch was the elephant in the room. As far as model friendliness goes, VP Nick Turley said that the GPT-5 was “just very to the point,” but that the new update would — as now announced — make it feel warmer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT-5-Flagship-Hero.png?w=1000" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI announced late Friday that it’s updating its latest model to be “warmer and friendlier.”&lt;/p&gt;
