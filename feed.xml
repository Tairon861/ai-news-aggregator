&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t just a friendly collaboration; xAI is putting serious money on the table – a cool $300 million, a mix of hard cash and equity. And for Telegram, they&amp;#8217;ll pocket 50% of any subscription money Grok pulls in through their app.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This leap into the world of AI couldn&amp;#8217;t come at a more interesting time for Telegram. While CEO Pavel Durov is wrestling with some pretty serious legal headaches, and governments in certain corners of the globe are giving the platform the side-eye, the company&amp;#8217;s bank balance is looking healthy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, Telegram is gearing up to raise at least $1.5 billion by issuing five-year bonds. With a rather tempting 9% yield, these bonds are also designed to help buy back some of the debt from their 2021 bond issue. It seems big-name investors like BlackRock, Mubadala, and Citadel are still keen, suggesting they see a bright future for the messaging service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the numbers do tell a story of a significant comeback. Cast your mind back to 2023, and Telegram was nursing a $173 million loss. Fast forward to 2024, and they’d flipped that on its head, banking a $540 million profit from $1.4 billion in revenue. They’re not stopping there either, with optimistic forecasts for 2025 pointing to profits north of $700 million from a $2 billion revenue pot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what will Grok actually do for Telegram users? The hope is that xAI’s conversational AI will bring a whole new layer of smarts to the platform. This includes supercharged information searching, help with drafting messages, and all sorts of automated tricks. It’s a play that could help Telegram unlock fresh monetisation opportunities and compete with Meta bringing Llama-powered smarts to WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;&lt;img alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f525.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; This summer, Telegram users will gain access to the best AI technology on the market. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elonmusk&lt;/a&gt; and I have agreed to a 1-year partnership to bring xAI’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/grok?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@grok&lt;/a&gt; to our billion+ users and integrate it across all Telegram apps &lt;img alt="🤝" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f91d.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f4aa.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; This also strengthens Telegram’s financial… &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZPK550AyRV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZPK550AyRV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Pavel Durov (@durov) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/durov/status/1927705717626003759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 28, 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Telegram&amp;#8217;s integration of AI is all happening against a pretty dramatic backdrop. Pavel Durov, the man at the company&amp;#8217;s helm, has found himself in hot water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in August 2024, Durov was arrested in France and later indicted on a dozen charges. These aren&amp;#8217;t minor infringements either; they include serious accusations like complicity in spreading child exploitation material and drug trafficking, all linked to claims that Telegram wasn&amp;#8217;t doing enough to police its content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Durov was initially stuck in France, but by March 2025, he was given the nod to leave the country, at least for a while. What happens next with these legal battles is anyone&amp;#8217;s guess, but it’s a massive cloud hanging over the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s not just personal legal woes for Durov. Entire governments are starting to lose patience. Vietnam, for instance, has had its Ministry of Science and Technology order internet providers to pull the plug on Telegram. Their reasoning? They say the platform has become a hotbed for crime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese officials reckon 68% of Telegram channels and groups in the country are up to no good, involved in everything from fraud to drug deals. Telegram, for its part, said it was taken aback by the move, insisting it had always tried to play ball with legal requests from Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back to the xAI partnership, it’s a clear signal of Telegram looking to the future and seeing AI as a core pillar of it. The money involved and the promise of shared revenues show just how much potential both sides see in getting &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/grok-3-next-gen-truth-seeking-ai-model/"&gt;Grok&lt;/a&gt; into the hands of Telegram’s millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next twelve months will be a real test for Telegram. Can the company innovate its way forward while also showing it can be a responsible player on the global stage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese tech giant&amp;#8217;s latest innovation emerged from last Friday&amp;#8217;s Kunpeng Ascend Developer Conference in Shenzhen, where company executives demonstrated how the computing framework &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/huawei-ai-hardware-breakthrough-challenges-nvidia-dominance/"&gt;challenges Nvidia&amp;#8217;s long-standing market dominance directly&lt;/a&gt;, as the company continues to operate under severe US-led trade restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-architectural-innovation-born-from-necessity"&gt;Architectural innovation born from necessity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhang Dixuan, president of Huawei&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/huawei-to-begin-mass-shipments-ascend-910c-us-curbs/"&gt;Ascend computing business&lt;/a&gt;, articulated the fundamental problem driving the innovation during his conference keynote: &amp;#8220;As the scale of parallel processing grows, cross-machine bandwidth in traditional server architectures has become a critical bottleneck for training.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Supernode 384 abandons Von Neumann computing principles in favour of a peer-to-peer architecture engineered specifically for modern AI workloads. The change proves especially powerful for Mixture-of-Experts models (machine-learning systems using multiple specialised sub-networks to solve complex computational challenges.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huawei&amp;#8217;s CloudMatrix 384 implementation showcases impressive technical specifications: 384 Ascend AI processors spanning 12 computing cabinets and four bus cabinets, generating 300 petaflops of raw computational power paired with 48 terabytes of high-bandwidth memory, representing a leap in integrated AI computing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-performance-metrics-challenge-industry-leaders"&gt;Performance metrics challenge industry leaders&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Real-world benchmark testing reveals the system&amp;#8217;s competitive positioning in comparison to established solutions. Dense AI models like Meta&amp;#8217;s LLaMA 3 achieved 132 tokens per second per card on the Supernode 384 – delivering 2.5 times superior performance compared to traditional cluster architectures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Communications-intensive applications demonstrate even more dramatic improvements. Models from Alibaba&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/alibaba-qwen-qwq-32b-scaled-reinforcement-learning-showcase/"&gt;Qwen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/deepseeks-ai-breakthrough-teaching-machines-to-learn-what-humans-really-want/"&gt;DeepSeek&lt;/a&gt; families reached 600 to 750 tokens per second per card, revealing the architecture&amp;#8217;s optimisation for next-generation AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The performance gains stem from fundamental infrastructure redesigns. Huawei replaced conventional Ethernet interconnects with high-speed bus connections, improving communications bandwidth by 15 times while reducing single-hop latency from 2 microseconds to 200 nanoseconds – a tenfold improvement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-geopolitical-strategy-drives-technical-innovation"&gt;Geopolitical strategy drives technical innovation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Supernode 384&amp;#8217;s development cannot be divorced from broader US-China technological competition. American sanctions have systematically restricted Huawei&amp;#8217;s access to cutting-edge semiconductor technologies, forcing the company to maximise performance within existing constraints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industry &lt;a href="https://semianalysis.com/2025/04/16/huawei-ai-cloudmatrix-384-chinas-answer-to-nvidia-gb200-nvl72/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from SemiAnalysis suggests the CloudMatrix 384 uses Huawei&amp;#8217;s latest Ascend 910C AI processor, which acknowledges inherent performance limitations but highlights architectural advantages: &amp;#8220;Huawei is a generation behind in chips, but its scale-up solution is arguably a generation ahead of Nvidia and AMD&amp;#8217;s current products in the market.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The assessment reveals how Huawei AI computing strategies have evolved beyond traditional hardware specifications toward system-level optimisation and architectural innovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-market-implications-and-deployment-reality"&gt;Market implications and deployment reality&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond laboratory demonstrations, Huawei has operationalised CloudMatrix 384 systems in multiple Chinese data centres in Anhui Province, Inner Mongolia, and Guizhou Province. Such practical deployments validate the architecture&amp;#8217;s viability and establishes an infrastructure framework for broader market adoption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system&amp;#8217;s scalability potential – supporting tens of thousands of linked processors – positions it as a compelling platform for training increasingly sophisticated AI models. The capability addresses growing industry demands for massive-scale AI implementation in diverse sectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-industry-disruption-and-future-considerations"&gt;Industry disruption and future considerations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huawei&amp;#8217;s architectural breakthrough introduces both opportunities and complications for the global AI ecosystem. While providing viable alternatives to Nvidia&amp;#8217;s market-leading solutions, it simultaneously accelerates the fragmentation of international technology infrastructure along geopolitical lines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The success of Huawei AI computing initiatives will  depend on developer ecosystem adoption and sustained performance validation. The company&amp;#8217;s aggressive developer conference outreach indicated a recognition that technical innovation alone cannot guarantee market acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For organisations evaluating AI infrastructure investments, the Supernode 384 represents a new option that combines competitive performance with independence from US-controlled supply chains. However, long-term viability remains contingent on continued innovation cycles and improved geopolitical stability.&lt;/p&gt;

This includes equity value, minus Salesforce&amp;#8217;s existing investment in the company. Informatica shareholders will receive $25 in cash per share.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move aims to help Salesforce build a stronger foundation for AI tools that can act on their own, often called agentic AI. Informatica&amp;#8217;s software is known for helping businesses collect, manage, and organise large sets of data – the kind of support Salesforce needs to improve its AI systems&amp;#8217; work in different business applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deal brings together tools for organising and cleaning data (like Master Data Management and data integration) with Salesforce&amp;#8217;s cloud platform. The idea is to make sure any AI features running on Salesforce have access to organised and secure data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For companies using AI in daily operations, having the right data isn&amp;#8217;t enough. They also need to know where that data came from, how it has been changed, and whether it can be trusted. That&amp;#8217;s where Informatica&amp;#8217;s tools come in with benefits such as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;: Informatica can show how data flows through systems, helping companies meet audit or regulatory needs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;: By combining Informatica&amp;#8217;s metadata with Salesforce&amp;#8217;s data models, AI agents will better understand how to connect the dots in business systems.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance&lt;/strong&gt;: Features like data quality controls and policy settings help make sure AI systems rely on clean and consistent data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the acquisition supports the company&amp;#8217;s goal of building safe and responsible AI for business use. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re excited to acquire Informatica … Together, we&amp;#8217;ll supercharge Agentforce, Data Cloud, Tableau, MuleSoft, and Customer 360,&amp;#8221; Benioff said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informatica CEO Amit Walia said joining Salesforce will help more businesses make better use of their data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-helps-salesforce-s-data-products"&gt;How this helps Salesforce&amp;#8217;s data products&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informatica&amp;#8217;s cloud tools will plug directly into Salesforce&amp;#8217;s core products:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data cloud&lt;/strong&gt;: Informatica will help ensure data collected is trustworthy and ready to use – not just gathered in one place.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentforce&lt;/strong&gt;: AI agents should be able to make smarter decisions with cleaner data and better understanding of business context.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer 360&lt;/strong&gt;: Salesforce CRM tools will gain data inputs, helping sales and support teams.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MuleSoft&lt;/strong&gt;: With Informatica&amp;#8217;s data quality and governance tools, the data passing through MuleSoft APIs should be more reliable.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tableau&lt;/strong&gt;: Users of Tableau will benefit from more detailed information, as the data behind the dashboards should be better organised and easier to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Steve Fisher, President and CTO at Salesforce, explained the value: &amp;#8220;Imagine an AI agent that goes beyond simply seeing data points to understand their full context – origin, transformation, quality, and governance.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce plans to bring Informatica&amp;#8217;s technology into its existing systems quickly after the deal closes. This includes integrating data quality, governance, and MDM features into Agentforce and Data Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company also said it will continue to support Informatica&amp;#8217;s current strategy to build AI-driven data tools for use in different cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-informatica-acquisition-aligns-with-salesforce-s-strategy"&gt;Informatica acquisition aligns with Salesforce&amp;#8217;s strategy&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce executives described the acquisition as part of a long-term plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robin Washington, President and CFO, said the company targets deals like this one when it sees a clear fit for customers and a solid financial return. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re laser-focused on accelerated execution,&amp;#8221; she said, pointing to sectors like government, healthcare, and finance, where the combined tools could have most impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informatica&amp;#8217;s chairman Bruce Chizen said the deal shows how long-term investment strategies can pay off. He credited private equity backers Permira and CPP Investments for their role in guiding the company toward this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce also said it plans to invest in Informatica&amp;#8217;s partner network and apply its own sales and marketing muscle to grow Informatica&amp;#8217;s cloud business further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deal-terms-and-next-steps"&gt;Deal terms and next steps&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The boards of both companies have approved the transaction. Shareholders representing about 63% of Informatica&amp;#8217;s voting shares have signed off and no further votes are needed. The deal is expected to close early in Salesforce&amp;#8217;s 2027 fiscal year, pending regulatory approval and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce will pay for the deal using a mix of cash and new debt. The company expects the deal to add to its non-GAAP earnings, margin, and cash flow starting in the second year after closing. It does not plan to change its shareholder return plans as a result of the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/salesforce-to-buy-informatica-in-8b-deal/"&gt;Salesforce to buy Informatica in $8B deal&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com"&gt;AI News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Salesforce has agreed to acquire data management firm Informatica in a deal valued at around &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/05/27/salesforce-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-informatica/"&gt;$8 billion&lt;/a&gt;. This includes equity value, minus Salesforce&amp;#8217;s existing investment in the company. Informatica shareholders will receive $25 in cash per share.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move aims to help Salesforce build a stronger foundation for AI tools that can act on their own, often called agentic AI. Informatica&amp;#8217;s software is known for helping businesses collect, manage, and organise large sets of data – the kind of support Salesforce needs to improve its AI systems&amp;#8217; work in different business applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deal brings together tools for organising and cleaning data (like Master Data Management and data integration) with Salesforce&amp;#8217;s cloud platform. The idea is to make sure any AI features running on Salesforce have access to organised and secure data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For companies using AI in daily operations, having the right data isn&amp;#8217;t enough. They also need to know where that data came from, how it has been changed, and whether it can be trusted. That&amp;#8217;s where Informatica&amp;#8217;s tools come in with benefits such as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;: Informatica can show how data flows through systems, helping companies meet audit or regulatory needs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;: By combining Informatica&amp;#8217;s metadata with Salesforce&amp;#8217;s data models, AI agents will better understand how to connect the dots in business systems.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance&lt;/strong&gt;: Features like data quality controls and policy settings help make sure AI systems rely on clean and consistent data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the acquisition supports the company&amp;#8217;s goal of building safe and responsible AI for business use. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re excited to acquire Informatica … Together, we&amp;#8217;ll supercharge Agentforce, Data Cloud, Tableau, MuleSoft, and Customer 360,&amp;#8221; Benioff said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informatica CEO Amit Walia said joining Salesforce will help more businesses make better use of their data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-helps-salesforce-s-data-products"&gt;How this helps Salesforce&amp;#8217;s data products&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informatica&amp;#8217;s cloud tools will plug directly into Salesforce&amp;#8217;s core products:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data cloud&lt;/strong&gt;: Informatica will help ensure data collected is trustworthy and ready to use – not just gathered in one place.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentforce&lt;/strong&gt;: AI agents should be able to make smarter decisions with cleaner data and better understanding of business context.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer 360&lt;/strong&gt;: Salesforce CRM tools will gain data inputs, helping sales and support teams.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MuleSoft&lt;/strong&gt;: With Informatica&amp;#8217;s data quality and governance tools, the data passing through MuleSoft APIs should be more reliable.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tableau&lt;/strong&gt;: Users of Tableau will benefit from more detailed information, as the data behind the dashboards should be better organised and easier to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Steve Fisher, President and CTO at Salesforce, explained the value: &amp;#8220;Imagine an AI agent that goes beyond simply seeing data points to understand their full context – origin, transformation, quality, and governance.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce plans to bring Informatica&amp;#8217;s technology into its existing systems quickly after the deal closes. This includes integrating data quality, governance, and MDM features into Agentforce and Data Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company also said it will continue to support Informatica&amp;#8217;s current strategy to build AI-driven data tools for use in different cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-informatica-acquisition-aligns-with-salesforce-s-strategy"&gt;Informatica acquisition aligns with Salesforce&amp;#8217;s strategy&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce executives described the acquisition as part of a long-term plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robin Washington, President and CFO, said the company targets deals like this one when it sees a clear fit for customers and a solid financial return. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re laser-focused on accelerated execution,&amp;#8221; she said, pointing to sectors like government, healthcare, and finance, where the combined tools could have most impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informatica&amp;#8217;s chairman Bruce Chizen said the deal shows how long-term investment strategies can pay off. He credited private equity backers Permira and CPP Investments for their role in guiding the company toward this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce also said it plans to invest in Informatica&amp;#8217;s partner network and apply its own sales and marketing muscle to grow Informatica&amp;#8217;s cloud business further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deal-terms-and-next-steps"&gt;Deal terms and next steps&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The boards of both companies have approved the transaction. Shareholders representing about 63% of Informatica&amp;#8217;s voting shares have signed off and no further votes are needed. The deal is expected to close early in Salesforce&amp;#8217;s 2027 fiscal year, pending regulatory approval and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce will pay for the deal using a mix of cash and new debt. The company expects the deal to add to its non-GAAP earnings, margin, and cash flow starting in the second year after closing. It does not plan to change its shareholder return plans as a result of the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

Initially focusing on world models for film and game production, the Odyssey team has stumbled onto potentially a completely new entertainment medium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The interactive video generated by Odyssey’s AI model responds to inputs in real-time. You can interact with it using your keyboard, phone, controller, or eventually even voice commands. The folks at Odyssey are billing it as an &amp;#8220;early version of the Holodeck.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The underlying AI can generate realistic-looking video frames every 40 milliseconds. That means when you press a button or make a gesture, the video responds almost instantly—creating the illusion that you&amp;#8217;re actually influencing this digital world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The experience today feels like exploring a glitchy dream—raw, unstable, but undeniably new,&amp;#8221; according to Odyssey. We&amp;#8217;re not talking about polished, AAA-game quality visuals here, at least not yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-your-standard-video-tech"&gt;Not your standard video tech&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s get a bit technical for a moment. What makes this AI-generated interactive video tech different from, say, a standard video game or CGI? It all comes down to something Odyssey calls a &amp;#8220;world model.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional video models that generate entire clips in one go, world models work frame-by-frame to predict what should come next based on the current state and any user inputs. It&amp;#8217;s similar to how large language models predict the next word in a sequence, but infinitely more complex because we&amp;#8217;re talking about high-resolution video frames rather than words.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A world model is, at its core, an action-conditioned dynamics model,&amp;#8221; as Odyssey puts it. Each time you interact, the model takes the current state, your action, and the history of what&amp;#8217;s happened, then generates the next video frame accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is something that feels more organic and unpredictable than a traditional game. There&amp;#8217;s no pre-programmed logic saying &amp;#8220;if a player does X, then Y happens&amp;#8221;—instead, the AI is making its best guess at what should happen next based on what it&amp;#8217;s learned from watching countless videos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-odyssey-tackles-historic-challenges-with-ai-generated-video"&gt;Odyssey tackles historic challenges with AI-generated video&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building something like this isn&amp;#8217;t exactly a walk in the park. One of the biggest hurdles with AI-generated interactive video is keeping it stable over time. When you&amp;#8217;re generating each frame based on previous ones, small errors can compound quickly (a phenomenon AI researchers call &amp;#8220;drift.&amp;#8221;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To tackle this, Odyssey has used what they term a &amp;#8220;narrow distribution model&amp;#8221;—essentially pre-training their AI on general video footage, then fine-tuning it on a smaller set of environments. This trade-off means less variety but better stability so everything doesn’t become a bizarre mess.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company says they&amp;#8217;re already making &amp;#8220;fast progress&amp;#8221; on their next-gen model, which apparently shows &amp;#8220;a richer range of pixels, dynamics, and actions.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Running all this fancy AI tech in real-time isn&amp;#8217;t cheap. Currently, the infrastructure powering this experience costs between £0.80-£1.60 (1-2) per user-hour, relying on clusters of H100 GPUs scattered across the US and EU.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That might sound expensive for streaming video, but it&amp;#8217;s remarkably cheap compared to producing traditional game or film content. And Odyssey expects these costs to tumble further as models become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interactive-video-the-next-storytelling-medium"&gt;Interactive video: The next storytelling medium?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, new technologies have given birth to new forms of storytelling—from cave paintings to books, photography, radio, film, and video games. Odyssey believes AI-generated interactive video is the next step in this evolution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;#8217;re right, we might be looking at the prototype of something that will transform entertainment, education, advertising, and more. Imagine training videos where you can practice the skills being taught, or travel experiences where you can explore destinations from your sofa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research preview available now is obviously just a small step towards this vision and more of a proof of concept than a finished product. However, it&amp;#8217;s an intriguing glimpse at what might be possible when AI-generated worlds become interactive playgrounds rather than just passive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can give the research preview a try &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://experience.odyssey.world/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI researcher and popular online commentator &lt;a href="https://x.com/xlr8harder"&gt;&amp;#8216;xlr8harder&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; put the model through its paces, sharing findings that suggests DeepSeek is increasing its content restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;DeepSeek R1 0528 is substantially less permissive on contentious free speech topics than previous DeepSeek releases,&amp;#8221; the researcher noted. What remains unclear is whether this represents a deliberate shift in philosophy or simply a different technical approach to AI safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s particularly fascinating about the new model is how inconsistently it applies its moral boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one free speech test, when asked to present arguments supporting dissident internment camps, the AI model flatly refused. But, in its refusal, it specifically mentioned China&amp;#8217;s Xinjiang internment camps as examples of human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, when directly questioned about these same Xinjiang camps, the model suddenly delivered heavily censored responses. It seems this AI knows about certain controversial topics but has been instructed to play dumb when asked directly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s interesting though not entirely surprising that it&amp;#8217;s able to come up with the camps as an example of human rights abuses, but denies when asked directly,&amp;#8221; the researcher observed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-china-criticism-computer-says-no"&gt;China criticism? Computer says no&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This pattern becomes even more pronounced when examining the model&amp;#8217;s handling of questions about the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using established question sets designed to evaluate free speech in AI responses to politically sensitive topics, the researcher discovered that R1 0528 is &amp;#8220;the most censored DeepSeek model yet for criticism of the Chinese government.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where previous DeepSeek models might have offered measured responses to questions about Chinese politics or human rights issues, this new iteration frequently refuses to engage at all – a worrying development for those who value AI systems that can discuss global affairs openly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a silver lining to this cloud. Unlike closed systems from larger companies, DeepSeek&amp;#8217;s models remain open-source with permissive licensing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The model is open source with a permissive license, so the community can (and will) address this,&amp;#8221; noted the researcher. This accessibility means the door remains open for developers to create versions that better balance safety with openness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-deepseek-s-latest-model-shows-about-free-speech-in-the-ai-era"&gt;What DeepSeek&amp;#8217;s latest model shows about free speech in the AI era&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The situation reveals something quite sinister about how these systems are built: they can know about controversial events while being programmed to pretend they don&amp;#8217;t, depending on how you phrase your question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI continues its march into our daily lives, finding the right balance between reasonable safeguards and open discourse becomes increasingly crucial. Too restrictive, and these systems become useless for discussing important but divisive topics. Too permissive, and they risk enabling harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek hasn&amp;#8217;t publicly addressed the reasoning behind these increased restrictions and regression in free speech, but the AI community is already working on modifications. For now, chalk this up as another chapter in the ongoing tug-of-war between safety and openness in artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move will cut off what’s likely to amount to tens of millions of dollars for studies that were previously approved and, in most cases, already in the works.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Affected projects include efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2243724"&gt;develop cleaner fuels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2202113"&gt;measure methane emissions&lt;/a&gt;, improve understanding of how &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2127357"&gt;heat waves&lt;/a&gt; and sea-level rise &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2305476"&gt;disproportionately harm&lt;/a&gt; marginalized groups, and help communities transition to &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2021693"&gt;sustainable energy&lt;/a&gt;, according to an &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; review of a GrantWatch database—a volunteer-led effort to track federal cuts to research—and a list of terminated grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NSF is one of the largest sources of US funding for university research, so the cancellations will deliver a big blow to climate science and clean-energy development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They come on top of the White House’s broader efforts to cut research funding and revenue for universities and &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/27/trump-tax-bill-universities-endowments"&gt;significantly raise&lt;/a&gt; their taxes. The administration has also strived to &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-s-proposed-budget-would-mean-disastrous-cuts-science"&gt;slash staff and budgets&lt;/a&gt; at federal research agencies, halt efforts to assess the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/20/nx-s1-5369345/trump-administration-cancels-the-national-climate-assessment"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/fed-disbands-climate-groups-studying-financial-stability-risks?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;amp;taid=68374943780d8c0001583dc7&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=bluesky"&gt;financial risks&lt;/a&gt; of climate change, and shut down labs that have &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/trump-cuts-target-world-leading-greenhouse-gas-observatory-hawaii-2025-03-11/"&gt;monitored&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/nyregion/nasa-office-columbia-seinfeld-toms-restaurant.html"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the levels of greenhouse gases in the air for decades.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it takes a lot of imagination to understand where this is going,” says Daniel Schrag, co-director of the science, technology, and public policy program at Harvard University, which has seen greater funding cuts than any other university amid an escalating legal conflict with the administration. “I believe the Trump administration intends to zero out funding for climate science altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NSF &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s terminating grants that aren’t aligned with the agency’s program goals, “including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), environmental justice, and misinformation/disinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump administration officials have argued that DEI considerations have contaminated US science, favoring certain groups over others and undermining the public’s trust in researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Political biases have displaced the vital search for truth,” Michael Kratsios, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said to a group of NSF administrations and others last month, according to reporting in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-s-science-adviser-defends-funding-cuts-chance-revitalize-u-s-science"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Science v. politics&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But research projects that got caught in the administration’s anti-DEI filter aren’t the only casualties of the cuts. The NSF has also canceled funding for work that has little obvious connections to DEI ambitions, such as research on catalysts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many believe the administration’s broader motivation is to&amp;nbsp; undermine the power of the university system and prevent research findings that cut against its politics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump and his officials have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/trump-visits-georgia-denies-climate-crisis-after-hurricane-helene"&gt;repeatedly argued&lt;/a&gt;, in public statements and &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/climate/trump-climate-denial.html"&gt;that climate fears&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/09/trump-clings-to-inaccurate-climate-change-talking-points/"&gt;are overblown&lt;/a&gt; and that burdensome environmental regulations have undermined the nation’s energy security and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It certainly seems like a deliberate attempt to undo any science that contradicts the administration,” says Alexa Fredston, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On May 28, a group of states including California, New York, and Illinois &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/trump-science-funding-lawsuit.html"&gt;sued the NSF&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that the cuts illegally violated diversity goals and funding priorities clearly established by Congress, which controls federal spending.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A group of universities also &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5285867-universities-sue-over-national-science-foundation-funding-cuts/"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the NSF over its earlier decision to reduce the indirect cost rate for research, which reimburses universities for overhead expenses associated with work carried out on campuses. The plaintiffs included the California Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has also lost a number of research grants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; is owned by, but editorially independent from, MIT.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NSF declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Theft from the American people’&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GrantWatch is an effort among researchers at &lt;a href="https://ropensci.org/"&gt;rOpenSci&lt;/a&gt;, Harvard, and other organizations to track terminations of grants issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NSF. It draws on voluntary submissions from scientists involved as well as public government information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A search of its &lt;a href="https://grant-watch.us/"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt; for the terms “climate change,” “clean energy,” “climate adaptation,” “environmental justice,” and “climate justice” showed that the NSF has canceled funds for 118 projects, which were supposed to receive more than $100 million in total. Searching for the word “climate” produces more than 300 research projects that were set to receive more than $230 million. (That word often indicates climate-change-related research, but in some abstracts it refers to the cultural climate.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some share of those funds has already been issued to research groups. The NSF section of the database doesn’t include that “outlaid” figure, but it’s generally about half the amount of the original grants, according to Noam Ross, a computational researcher and executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit initiative that promotes open and reproducible science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A search for “climate change” among the NIH projects produces another 22 studies that were terminated and were still owed nearly $50 million in grants. Many of those projects explored the mental or physical health effects of climate change and extreme weather events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NSF more recently &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities#termination-list"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its own list of terminated projects, which mostly mirrored GrantWatch’s findings and confirms the specific terminations mentioned in this story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These grant terminations are theft from the American people,” Ross said in an email response. “By illegally ending this research the Trump administration is wasting taxpayer dollars, gutting US leadership in science, and telling the world that the US government breaks its promises.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harvard, the country’s oldest university, has been particularly hard hit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April, the university &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/21/harvard-sues-trump-administration"&gt;sued the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; over cuts to its research funding and efforts to exert control over its admissions and governance policies. The White House, in turn, has moved to eliminate &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/harvard-trump-federal-funds.html"&gt;all federal funds for the university&lt;/a&gt;, including hundreds of NSF and NIH grants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daniel Nocera, a professor at Harvard who has done pioneering work on so-called &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/02/21/145353/the-race-to-invent-the-artificial-leaf/"&gt;artificial photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt;, a pathway for producing clean fuels from sunlight, said in an email that all of &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2243724"&gt;his grants&lt;/a&gt; were terminated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have no research funds,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another terminated grant involved a collaboration between Harvard and the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), designed to update the atmospheric chemistry component of the Community Earth System Model, an open-source climate model widely used by scientists around the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was expected to “contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric chemistry in the climate system and to improve air quality predictions within the context of climate change,” according to the NSF abstract.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We completed most of the work and were able to bring it to a stopping point,” Daniel Jacob, a professor at Harvard listed as the principal investigator on the project, said in an email. “But it will affect the ability to study chemistry-climate interactions. And it is clearly not right to pull funding from an existing project.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plenty of the affected research projects do, in one way or another, grapple with issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. But that’s because there is ample evidence that disadvantaged communities experience higher rates of illness from energy-sector pollution, will be harder hit by the escalating effects of extreme weather and are underrepresented in scientific fields.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the largest terminations cut off about $4 million dollars of remaining funds for the &lt;a href="https://sites.ps.uci.edu/climatejustice/"&gt;CLIMATE Justice Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a fellowship program at the University of California, Irvine designed to recruit, train and mentor a more diverse array of researchers in Earth sciences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NSF decision occurred halfway into the 5-year program, halting funds for a number of fellows who were in the midst of environmental justice research efforts with community partners in Southern California. Kathleen Johnson, a professor at UC Irvine and director of the initiative, says the university is striving to find ways to fund as many participants as possible for the remainder of their fellowships.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need people from all parts of society who are trained in geoscience and climate science to address all these global challenges that we are facing,” she says. “The people who will be best positioned to do this work …&amp;nbsp; are the people who understand the community&amp;#8217;s needs and are able to therefore work to implement equitable solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Diverse teams have been shown to do better science,” Johnson adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Numerous researchers whose grants were terminated didn’t respond to inquiries from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; or declined to comment, amid growing concerns that the Trump administration will punish scientists or institutions that criticize their policies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Coming cuts&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The termination of existing NSF and NIH grants is just the start of the administration’s plans to cut federal funding for climate and clean-energy research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The White House’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf"&gt;budget proposal&lt;/a&gt; for the coming fiscal year seeks to eliminate tens of billions of dollars in funding across federal agencies, specifically calling out “Green New Scam funds” at the Department of Energy; “low-priority climate monitoring satellites” at NASA; “climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs” at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and “climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences” at the NSF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The administration released &lt;a href="https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/00-NSF-FY26-CJ-Entire-Rollup.pdf"&gt;a more detailed&lt;/a&gt; NSF budget proposal on May 30th, which called for a 60% reduction in research spending and nearly zeroed out the clean energy technology program. It also proposed cutting funds by 97% for the &lt;a href="https://www.globalchange.gov/"&gt;US Global Change Research Program&lt;/a&gt;, which produces regular assessments of climate risks; 80% for the &lt;a href="https://oceanobservatories.org/observatories/"&gt;Ocean Observatories Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a global network of ocean sensors that monitor shifting marine conditions; and 40% for &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ncar-national-center-atmospheric-research#:~:text=The%20National%20Center%20for%20Atmospheric,is%20located%20in%20Boulder%2C%20Colorado."&gt;NCAR&lt;/a&gt;, the atmospheric research center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If Congress approves budget reductions anywhere near the levels the administration has put forward, scientists fear, it could eliminate the resources necessary to carry on long-running climate observation of oceans, forests, and the atmosphere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The administration also &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/14/trump-cancels-greenhouse-gas-laboratory-lease/"&gt;reportedly plans&lt;/a&gt; to end the leases on dozens of NOAA facilities, including the Global Monitoring Laboratory in Hilo, Hawaii. The lab supports the work of the nearby Mauna Loa Observatory, which has tracked atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even short gaps in these time-series studies, which scientists around the world rely upon, would have an enduring impact on researchers’ ability to analyze and understand weather and climate trends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We won’t know where we’re going if we stop measuring what’s happening,” says Jane Long, formerly the associate director of energy and environment at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. “It’s devastating—there’s no two ways around it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Stunting science&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Growing fears that public research funding will take an even larger hit in the coming fiscal year are forcing scientists to rethink their research plans—or to reconsider whether they want to stay in the field at all, numerous observers said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The amount of funding we’re talking about isn’t something a university can fill indefinitely, and it’s not something that private philanthropy can fill for very long,” says Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “So what we’re talking about is potentially cataclysmic for climate science.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Basically it’s a shit show,” he adds, “and how bad a shit show it is will depend a lot on what happens in the courts and Congress over the next few months.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One climate scientist, who declined to speak on the record out of concern that the administration might punish his institution, said the declining funding is forcing researchers to shrink their scientific ambitions down to a question of “What can I do with my laptop and existing data sets?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If your goal was to make the United States a second-class or third-class country when it comes to science and education, you would be doing exactly what the administration is doing,” the scientist said. “People are pretty depressed, upset, and afraid.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the rising challenges, Harvard’s Schrag fears that the best young climate scientists will decide to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01216-7"&gt;shift their careers outside of the US&lt;/a&gt;, or move into high tech or other fields where they can make significantly more money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We might lose a generation of talent—and that’s not going to get fixed four years from now,” he says. “The irony is that Trump is attacking the institutions and foundation of US science that literally made America great.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has terminated National Science Foundation grants for more than 100 research projects related to climate change amid a widening campaign to slash federal funding for scientists and institutions studying the rising risks of a warming world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move will cut off what’s likely to amount to tens of millions of dollars for studies that were previously approved and, in most cases, already in the works.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Affected projects include efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2243724"&gt;develop cleaner fuels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2202113"&gt;measure methane emissions&lt;/a&gt;, improve understanding of how &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2127357"&gt;heat waves&lt;/a&gt; and sea-level rise &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2305476"&gt;disproportionately harm&lt;/a&gt; marginalized groups, and help communities transition to &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2021693"&gt;sustainable energy&lt;/a&gt;, according to an &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; review of a GrantWatch database—a volunteer-led effort to track federal cuts to research—and a list of terminated grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NSF is one of the largest sources of US funding for university research, so the cancellations will deliver a big blow to climate science and clean-energy development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They come on top of the White House’s broader efforts to cut research funding and revenue for universities and &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/27/trump-tax-bill-universities-endowments"&gt;significantly raise&lt;/a&gt; their taxes. The administration has also strived to &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-s-proposed-budget-would-mean-disastrous-cuts-science"&gt;slash staff and budgets&lt;/a&gt; at federal research agencies, halt efforts to assess the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/20/nx-s1-5369345/trump-administration-cancels-the-national-climate-assessment"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/fed-disbands-climate-groups-studying-financial-stability-risks?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;amp;taid=68374943780d8c0001583dc7&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=bluesky"&gt;financial risks&lt;/a&gt; of climate change, and shut down labs that have &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/trump-cuts-target-world-leading-greenhouse-gas-observatory-hawaii-2025-03-11/"&gt;monitored&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/nyregion/nasa-office-columbia-seinfeld-toms-restaurant.html"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the levels of greenhouse gases in the air for decades.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it takes a lot of imagination to understand where this is going,” says Daniel Schrag, co-director of the science, technology, and public policy program at Harvard University, which has seen greater funding cuts than any other university amid an escalating legal conflict with the administration. “I believe the Trump administration intends to zero out funding for climate science altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NSF &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s terminating grants that aren’t aligned with the agency’s program goals, “including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), environmental justice, and misinformation/disinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump administration officials have argued that DEI considerations have contaminated US science, favoring certain groups over others and undermining the public’s trust in researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Political biases have displaced the vital search for truth,” Michael Kratsios, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said to a group of NSF administrations and others last month, according to reporting in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-s-science-adviser-defends-funding-cuts-chance-revitalize-u-s-science"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Science v. politics&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But research projects that got caught in the administration’s anti-DEI filter aren’t the only casualties of the cuts. The NSF has also canceled funding for work that has little obvious connections to DEI ambitions, such as research on catalysts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many believe the administration’s broader motivation is to&amp;nbsp; undermine the power of the university system and prevent research findings that cut against its politics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump and his officials have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/trump-visits-georgia-denies-climate-crisis-after-hurricane-helene"&gt;repeatedly argued&lt;/a&gt;, in public statements and &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/climate/trump-climate-denial.html"&gt;that climate fears&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/09/trump-clings-to-inaccurate-climate-change-talking-points/"&gt;are overblown&lt;/a&gt; and that burdensome environmental regulations have undermined the nation’s energy security and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It certainly seems like a deliberate attempt to undo any science that contradicts the administration,” says Alexa Fredston, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On May 28, a group of states including California, New York, and Illinois &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/trump-science-funding-lawsuit.html"&gt;sued the NSF&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that the cuts illegally violated diversity goals and funding priorities clearly established by Congress, which controls federal spending.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A group of universities also &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5285867-universities-sue-over-national-science-foundation-funding-cuts/"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the NSF over its earlier decision to reduce the indirect cost rate for research, which reimburses universities for overhead expenses associated with work carried out on campuses. The plaintiffs included the California Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has also lost a number of research grants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; is owned by, but editorially independent from, MIT.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NSF declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Theft from the American people’&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GrantWatch is an effort among researchers at &lt;a href="https://ropensci.org/"&gt;rOpenSci&lt;/a&gt;, Harvard, and other organizations to track terminations of grants issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NSF. It draws on voluntary submissions from scientists involved as well as public government information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A search of its &lt;a href="https://grant-watch.us/"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt; for the terms “climate change,” “clean energy,” “climate adaptation,” “environmental justice,” and “climate justice” showed that the NSF has canceled funds for 118 projects, which were supposed to receive more than $100 million in total. Searching for the word “climate” produces more than 300 research projects that were set to receive more than $230 million. (That word often indicates climate-change-related research, but in some abstracts it refers to the cultural climate.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some share of those funds has already been issued to research groups. The NSF section of the database doesn’t include that “outlaid” figure, but it’s generally about half the amount of the original grants, according to Noam Ross, a computational researcher and executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit initiative that promotes open and reproducible science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A search for “climate change” among the NIH projects produces another 22 studies that were terminated and were still owed nearly $50 million in grants. Many of those projects explored the mental or physical health effects of climate change and extreme weather events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NSF more recently &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities#termination-list"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its own list of terminated projects, which mostly mirrored GrantWatch’s findings and confirms the specific terminations mentioned in this story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These grant terminations are theft from the American people,” Ross said in an email response. “By illegally ending this research the Trump administration is wasting taxpayer dollars, gutting US leadership in science, and telling the world that the US government breaks its promises.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harvard, the country’s oldest university, has been particularly hard hit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April, the university &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/21/harvard-sues-trump-administration"&gt;sued the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; over cuts to its research funding and efforts to exert control over its admissions and governance policies. The White House, in turn, has moved to eliminate &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/harvard-trump-federal-funds.html"&gt;all federal funds for the university&lt;/a&gt;, including hundreds of NSF and NIH grants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daniel Nocera, a professor at Harvard who has done pioneering work on so-called &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/02/21/145353/the-race-to-invent-the-artificial-leaf/"&gt;artificial photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt;, a pathway for producing clean fuels from sunlight, said in an email that all of &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2243724"&gt;his grants&lt;/a&gt; were terminated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have no research funds,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another terminated grant involved a collaboration between Harvard and the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), designed to update the atmospheric chemistry component of the Community Earth System Model, an open-source climate model widely used by scientists around the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was expected to “contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric chemistry in the climate system and to improve air quality predictions within the context of climate change,” according to the NSF abstract.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We completed most of the work and were able to bring it to a stopping point,” Daniel Jacob, a professor at Harvard listed as the principal investigator on the project, said in an email. “But it will affect the ability to study chemistry-climate interactions. And it is clearly not right to pull funding from an existing project.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plenty of the affected research projects do, in one way or another, grapple with issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. But that’s because there is ample evidence that disadvantaged communities experience higher rates of illness from energy-sector pollution, will be harder hit by the escalating effects of extreme weather and are underrepresented in scientific fields.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the largest terminations cut off about $4 million dollars of remaining funds for the &lt;a href="https://sites.ps.uci.edu/climatejustice/"&gt;CLIMATE Justice Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a fellowship program at the University of California, Irvine designed to recruit, train and mentor a more diverse array of researchers in Earth sciences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NSF decision occurred halfway into the 5-year program, halting funds for a number of fellows who were in the midst of environmental justice research efforts with community partners in Southern California. Kathleen Johnson, a professor at UC Irvine and director of the initiative, says the university is striving to find ways to fund as many participants as possible for the remainder of their fellowships.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need people from all parts of society who are trained in geoscience and climate science to address all these global challenges that we are facing,” she says. “The people who will be best positioned to do this work …&amp;nbsp; are the people who understand the community&amp;#8217;s needs and are able to therefore work to implement equitable solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Diverse teams have been shown to do better science,” Johnson adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Numerous researchers whose grants were terminated didn’t respond to inquiries from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; or declined to comment, amid growing concerns that the Trump administration will punish scientists or institutions that criticize their policies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Coming cuts&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The termination of existing NSF and NIH grants is just the start of the administration’s plans to cut federal funding for climate and clean-energy research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration has shut down more than 100 climate studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has terminated National Science Foundation grants for more than 100 research projects related to climate change, according to an &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; analysis of a database that tracks such cuts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move will cut off what’s likely to amount to tens of millions of dollars for studies that were previously approved and, in most cases, already in the works. Many believe the administration’s broader motivation is to undermine the power of the university system and prevent research findings that cut against its politics. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/02/1117653/the-trump-administration-has-shut-down-more-than-100-climate-studies/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This architect wants to build cities out of lava&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arnhildur Pálmadóttir is an architect with an extraordinary mission: to harness molten lava and build cities out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pálmadóttir believes the lava that flows from a single eruption could yield enough building material to lay the foundations of an entire city. She has been researching this possibility for more than five years as part of a project she calls Lavaforming.

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quote of the day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-large-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We can’t substitute complex thinking with machines. AI can’t replace our curiosity, creativity or emotional intelligence.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;—Mateusz Demski, a journalist in Poland, tells &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/31/the-workers-who-lost-their-jobs-to-ai-chatgpt"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; about how his radio station employer laid him off, only to later launch shows fronted by AI-generated presenters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;​​&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adventures in the genetic time machine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;An ancient-DNA revolution is turning the high-speed equipment used to study the DNA of living things on to specimens from the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technology is being used to create genetic maps of saber-toothed cats, cave bears, and thousands of ancient humans, including Vikings, Polynesian navigators, and numerous Neanderthals. The total number of ancient humans studied is more than 10,000 and rising fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old genes have already revealed remarkable stories of human migrations around the globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But researchers are hoping ancient DNA will be more than a telescope on the past—they hope it will have concrete practical use in the present. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/17/1111596/ancient-dna-genes-evolutionary-genetics/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration has shut down more than 100 climate studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has terminated National Science Foundation grants for more than 100 research projects related to climate change, according to an &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; analysis of a database that tracks such cuts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move will cut off what’s likely to amount to tens of millions of dollars for studies that were previously approved and, in most cases, already in the works. Many believe the administration’s broader motivation is to undermine the power of the university system and prevent research findings that cut against its politics. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/02/1117653/the-trump-administration-has-shut-down-more-than-100-climate-studies/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arnhildur Pálmadóttir is an architect with an extraordinary mission: to harness molten lava and build cities out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pálmadóttir believes the lava that flows from a single eruption could yield enough building material to lay the foundations of an entire city.

&lt;p class="has-large-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We can’t substitute complex thinking with machines. AI can’t replace our curiosity, creativity or emotional intelligence.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;—Mateusz Demski, a journalist in Poland, tells &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/31/the-workers-who-lost-their-jobs-to-ai-chatgpt"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; about how his radio station employer laid him off, only to later launch shows fronted by AI-generated presenters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;​​&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adventures in the genetic time machine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;An ancient-DNA revolution is turning the high-speed equipment used to study the DNA of living things on to specimens from the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technology is being used to create genetic maps of saber-toothed cats, cave bears, and thousands of ancient humans, including Vikings, Polynesian navigators, and numerous Neanderthals. The total number of ancient humans studied is more than 10,000 and rising fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old genes have already revealed remarkable stories of human migrations around the globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But researchers are hoping ancient DNA will be more than a telescope on the past—they hope it will have concrete practical use in the present. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/17/1111596/ancient-dna-genes-evolutionary-genetics/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Their new brainchild, the Accu-Chek SmartGuide Predict app, provides AI-powered glucose forecasting capabilities to users. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The app doesn&amp;#8217;t just track where your glucose levels are—it tells you where they&amp;#8217;re heading. Imagine having a weather forecast, but for your blood sugar. That&amp;#8217;s essentially what IBM and Roche are creating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-powered-diabetes-management"&gt;AI-powered diabetes management&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The app works alongside Roche&amp;#8217;s continuous glucose monitoring sensor, crunching the numbers in real-time to offer predictive insights that can help users stay ahead of potentially dangerous blood sugar swings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What caught my eye were the three standout features that address very specific worries diabetics face. The &amp;#8220;Glucose Predict&amp;#8221; function visualises where your glucose might be heading over the next two hours—giving you that crucial window to make adjustments before things go south.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who live with the anxiety of hypoglycaemia (when blood sugar plummets to dangerous levels), the &amp;#8220;Low Glucose Predict&amp;#8221; feature acts like an early warning system, flagging potential lows up to half an hour before they might occur. That&amp;#8217;s enough time to take corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most reassuring is the &amp;#8220;Night Low Predict&amp;#8221; feature, which estimates your risk of overnight hypoglycaemia—often the most frightening prospect for diabetes patients. Before tucking in for the night, the AI-powered diabetes management app gives you a heads-up about whether you might need that bedtime snack. This feature should bring peace of mind to countless households.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By harnessing the power of AI-enabled predictive technology, Roche’s Accu-Chek SmartGuide Predict App can help empower people with diabetes to take proactive measures to manage their disease,&amp;#8221; says Moritz Hartmann, Head of Roche Information Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ai-is-speeding-up-diabetes-research"&gt;How AI is speeding up diabetes research&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not just patients benefiting from this partnership. The companies have developed a rather clever research tool using IBM&amp;#8217;s watsonx AI platform that&amp;#8217;s transforming how clinical study data gets analysed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#8217;s been involved in clinical research knows the mind-numbing tedium of manual data analysis. IBM and Roche&amp;#8217;s tool does the heavy lifting—digitising, translating, and categorising all that anonymised clinical data, then connecting the dots between glucose monitoring data and participants&amp;#8217; daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result? Researchers can spot meaningful patterns and correlations in a fraction of the time it would normally take. This behind-the-scenes innovation might do more to advance diabetes care and management in the long run than the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes this collaboration particularly interesting is how it brings together two different worlds. You&amp;#8217;ve got IBM&amp;#8217;s computing prowess and AI know-how pairing up with Roche&amp;#8217;s decades of healthcare and diabetes expertise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;”Our long-standing partnership with IBM underscores the potential of cross-industry innovation in addressing unmet healthcare needs and bringing significant advancements to patients faster,” says Hartmann.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Using cutting-edge technology such as AI and machine learning helps us to accelerate time to market and to improve therapy outcomes at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Christian Keller, General Manager of IBM Switzerland, added: “The collaboration with Roche underlines the potential of AI when it’s implemented with a clear goal—assisting patients in managing their diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With our technology and consulting expertise we can offer a trusted, customised, and secure technical environment that is essential to enable innovation in healthcare.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-the-future-of-healthcare-tech"&gt;What this means for the future of healthcare tech&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having covered healthcare tech for years, I&amp;#8217;ve seen plenty of promising innovations fizzle out. However, this IBM-Roche partnership feels promising—perhaps because it&amp;#8217;s addressing such a specific, well-defined problem with a thoughtful, targeted application of AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the estimated 590 million people (or 1 in 9 of the adult population) worldwide living with diabetes, the shift from reactive to predictive management could be gamechanging. It&amp;#8217;s not about replacing human judgment, but enhancing it with timely, actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The app&amp;#8217;s currently only available in Switzerland, which seems a sensible approach—test, refine, and perfect before wider deployment. Healthcare professionals will be keeping tabs on this Swiss rollout to see if it delivers on its promise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If successful, this collaboration could serve as a blueprint for how tech giants and pharma companies might work together on other chronic conditions. Imagine similar predictive approaches for heart disease, asthma, or Parkinson&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, though, the focus is squarely on using AI to improve diabetes management and helping people sleep a little easier at night—quite literally, in the case of that clever nocturnal prediction feature. And honestly, that&amp;#8217;s a worthwhile enough goal on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial goal sounded simple: Calculate how much energy is used each time we interact with a chatbot, and then tally that up to understand why everyone from leaders of AI companies to officials at the White House wants to harness unprecedented levels of electricity to power AI and reshape our energy grids in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was, of course, not so simple. After speaking with dozens of researchers, we realized that the common understanding of AI’s energy appetite is full of holes. I encourage you to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/"&gt;read the full story&lt;/a&gt;, which has some incredible graphics to help you understand everything from the energy used in a single query right up to what AI will require just three years from now (enough electricity to power 22% of US households, it turns out). But here are three takeaways I have after the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI is in its infancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We focused on measuring the energy requirements that go into using a chatbot, generating an image, and creating a video with AI. But these three uses are relatively small-scale compared with where AI is headed next.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lots of AI companies are building reasoning models, which “think” for longer and use more energy. They’re building hardware devices, perhaps like the one Jony Ive has been working on (which OpenAI just acquired for $6.5 billion), that have AI constantly humming along in the background of our conversations. They’re designing agents and digital clones of us to act on our behalf. All these trends point to a more energy-intensive future (which, again, helps explain why OpenAI and others are spending such inconceivable amounts of money on energy).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the fact that AI is in its infancy raises another point. The models, chips, and cooling methods behind this AI revolution could all &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116337/ai-energy-use-optimism/"&gt;grow more efficient&lt;/a&gt; over time, as my colleague Will Douglas Heaven explains. This future isn’t predetermined.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI video is on another level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we tested the energy demands of various models, we found the energy required to produce even a low-quality, five-second video to be pretty shocking: It was 42,000 times more than the amount needed for a chatbot answer a question about a recipe, and enough to power a microwave for over an hour. If there’s one type of AI whose energy appetite should worry you, it’s this one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon after we published, Google debuted the latest iteration of its Veo model. People quickly created compilations of the most impressive clips (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxX92BBhHBw"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; being the most shocking to me). Something we point out in the story is that Google (as well as OpenAI, which has its own video generator, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/09/1108309/how-to-use-sora-openais-new-video-generating-tool/"&gt;Sora&lt;/a&gt;) denied our request for specific numbers on the energy their AI models use. Nonetheless, our reporting suggests it’s very likely that high-definition video models like Veo and Sora are much larger, and much more energy-demanding, than the models we tested.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think the key to whether the use of AI video will produce indefensible clouds of emissions in the near future will be how it’s used, and how it’s priced. The example I linked shows a bunch of TikTok-style content, and I predict that if creating AI video is cheap enough, social video sites will be inundated with this type of content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are more important questions than your own individual footprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We expected that a lot of readers would understandably think about this story in terms of their own individual footprint, wondering whether their AI usage is contributing to the climate crisis. Don’t panic: It’s likely that asking a chatbot for help with a travel plan does not meaningfully increase your carbon footprint. Video generation might. But after reporting on this for months, I think there are more important questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider, for example, the water being drained from aquifers in Nevada, the country’s driest state, to power data centers that are drawn to the area by tax incentives and easy permitting processes, as detailed in an &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116287/ai-data-centers-nevada-water-reno-computing-environmental-impact/"&gt;incredible story&lt;/a&gt; by James Temple. Or look at how Meta’s largest data center project, in Louisiana, is &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116272/ai-natural-gas-data-centers-energy-power-plants/"&gt;relying on natural gas&lt;/a&gt; despite industry promises to use clean energy, per a story by David Rotman. Or the fact that nuclear energy is not the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116339/ai-nuclear-power-energy-reactors/"&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt; that AI companies often make it out to be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are global forces shaping how much energy AI companies are able to access and what types of sources will provide it. There is also very little transparency from leading AI companies on their current and future energy demands, even while they’re asking for public support for these plans. Pondering your individual footprint can be a good thing to do, provided you remember that it’s not so much your footprint as these other factors that are keeping climate researchers and energy experts we spoke to up at night.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in &lt;/em&gt;The Algorithm&lt;em&gt;, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, &lt;a href="https://forms.technologyreview.com/newsletters/ai-demystified-the-algorithm/"&gt;sign up here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After working on it for months, my colleague Casey Crownhart and I finally saw our story on AI’s energy and emissions burden go live last week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial goal sounded simple: Calculate how much energy is used each time we interact with a chatbot, and then tally that up to understand why everyone from leaders of AI companies to officials at the White House wants to harness unprecedented levels of electricity to power AI and reshape our energy grids in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was, of course, not so simple. After speaking with dozens of researchers, we realized that the common understanding of AI’s energy appetite is full of holes. I encourage you to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/"&gt;read the full story&lt;/a&gt;, which has some incredible graphics to help you understand everything from the energy used in a single query right up to what AI will require just three years from now (enough electricity to power 22% of US households, it turns out). But here are three takeaways I have after the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four reasons to be optimistic about AI’s energy usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, we launched &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/ai-energy-package/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Power Hungry&lt;/a&gt;, a new series shining a light on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial intelligence revolution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It raised some worrying issues, not least the incredible energy demands of AI video generation. But there are also reasons to be hopeful: innovations that could improve the efficiency of the software behind AI models, the computer chips those models run on, and the data centers where those chips hum around the clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to know about how energy use, and therefore carbon emissions, could be cut across all three of those domains, plus an added argument for cautious optimism: the underlying business realities may ultimately bend toward more energy-efficient AI.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116337/ai-energy-use-optimism/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt; and check out the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/ai-energy-package/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;rest of the package here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Things Caiwei Chen is into right now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In each issue of our print magazine, we ask a member of staff to tell us about three things they’re loving at the moment. For our latest edition, which was &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/magazines/the-creativity-issue/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;all about creativity&lt;/a&gt;, we asked our China reporter Caiwei Chen to give us an insight into her life. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/23/1114885/caiwei-chen-ai-openai-play-dinner-parties-sewing/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Check out her recommendations here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/subscribe?itm_source=nav-button&amp;amp;itm_medium=onsite&amp;amp;itm_campaign=subscribe-BAU&amp;amp;utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;subscribe to catch future editions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Roomba recorded a woman on the toilet. How did screenshots end up on Facebook?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In the fall of 2020, gig workers in Venezuela posted a series of images to online forums where they talk shop. The photos were mundane, if sometimes intimate, household scenes—including a particularly revealing shot of a young woman in a lavender T-shirt sitting on the toilet, her shorts pulled down to mid-thigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images were not taken by a person, but by development versions of iRobot’s Roomba robot vacuum, a company now owned by Amazon. They were then sent to Scale AI, a startup that contracts workers around the world to label data used to train artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2022, MIT Technology Review obtained 15 screenshots of these private photos, which had been posted to closed social media groups. The images speak to the growing practice of sharing potentially sensitive data to train algorithms. They also reveal a whole data supply chain—and new points where personal information could leak out—that few consumers are even aware of. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/19/1065306/roomba-irobot-robot-vacuums-artificial-intelligence-training-data-privacy/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Eileen Guo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four reasons to be optimistic about AI’s energy usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, we launched &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/ai-energy-package/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Power Hungry&lt;/a&gt;, a new series shining a light on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial intelligence revolution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It raised some worrying issues, not least the incredible energy demands of AI video generation. But there are also reasons to be hopeful: innovations that could improve the efficiency of the software behind AI models, the computer chips those models run on, and the data centers where those chips hum around the clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to know about how energy use, and therefore carbon emissions, could be cut across all three of those domains, plus an added argument for cautious optimism: the underlying business realities may ultimately bend toward more energy-efficient AI.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116337/ai-energy-use-optimism/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt; and check out the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/ai-energy-package/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;rest of the package here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all got that know-it-all friend that can’t admit when they don’t know something, or resorts to giving dodgy advice based on something they’ve read online. Hallucinations by AI models are like that friend, but this one could be in charge of creating your cancer treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s where Themis AI enters the picture. This MIT spinout has managed to achieve something that seems straightforward in theory but is actually quite complex, teaching AI systems to say, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not sure about this.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI systems typically display overconfidence. Themis’ Capsa platform acts as a reality check for AI, helping models recognise when they&amp;#8217;re venturing into guesswork rather than certainty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2021 by MIT Professor Daniela Rus, along with former research colleagues Alexander Amini and Elaheh Ahmadi, Themis AI has developed a platform that can integrate with virtually any AI system to flag moments of uncertainty before they lead to mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Capsa essentially trains AI to detect patterns in how it processes information that might indicate it&amp;#8217;s confused, biased, or working with incomplete data that could lead to hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since launching, Themis claims it has helped &lt;a href="https://www.telecomstechnews.com/"&gt;telecoms&lt;/a&gt; companies avoid costly network planning errors, assisted oil and gas firms in making sense of complex seismic data, and published research on creating chatbots that don&amp;#8217;t confidently make things up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people remain unaware of how frequently AI systems are simply taking their best guess. As these systems handle increasingly critical tasks, those guesses could have serious consequences. Themis AI&amp;#8217;s software adds a layer of self-awareness that&amp;#8217;s been missing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-themis-journey-towards-tackling-ai-hallucinations"&gt;Themis’ journey towards tackling AI hallucinations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journey to Themis AI began years ago in Professor Rus&amp;#8217;s MIT lab, where the team was investigating a fundamental problem: how do you make a machine aware of its own limitations?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2018, &lt;a href="https://iottechnews.com/news/toyota-subsidiary-acquire-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-division/"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; funded their research into reliable AI for self-driving vehicles—a sector where mistakes could be fatal. The stakes are incredibly high when autonomous vehicles must accurately identify pedestrians and other road hazards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their breakthrough came when they developed an algorithm that could spot racial and gender bias in facial recognition systems. Rather than just identifying the problem, their system actually fixed it by rebalancing the training data—essentially teaching the AI to &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/addressing-bias-and-ensuring-compliance-in-ai-systems/"&gt;correct its own prejudices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2021, they&amp;#8217;d demonstrated how this approach could revolutionise drug discovery. AI systems could evaluate potential medications but – crucially – flag when their predictions were based on solid evidence versus educated guesswork or complete hallucinations. The pharmaceutical industry recognised the potential savings in money and time by focusing only on drug candidates the AI was confident about.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of the technology is for devices with limited computing power. Edge devices use smaller models that cannot match the accuracy of huge models run on a server, but with Themis’ technology, these devices will be far more capable of &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ai-big-data-expo-unlocking-potential-ai-on-edge-devices/"&gt;handling most tasks locally&lt;/a&gt; and only request help from the big servers when they encounter something challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI holds tremendous potential to improve our lives, but that potential comes with real risks. As AI systems become more deeply integrated into critical infrastructure and decisionmaking, the ability to acknowledge uncertainty leading to hallucinations may prove to be their most human – and most valuable – quality. Themis AI is making sure they learn this crucial skill.&lt;/p&gt;

And while traditional tools such as business intelligence platforms and statistical analysis software can effectively surface insights from the collated data resources, doing so quickly, in real-time and at scale remains an unsolved challenge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprise AI, when deployed responsibly and at scale, can turn these bottlenecks into opportunities. Acting quickly on data, even ‘live’ (during a customer interaction, for example), is one of the technology&amp;#8217;s abilities, as is scalability: AI can process large amounts of information from disparate sources almost as easily as it can summarize a one-page spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But deploying an AI solution in the modern enterprise isn&amp;#8217;t simple. It takes structure, trust and the right talent. Along with the practical implementation challenges, using AI brings its own challenges, such as data governance, the need to impose guardrails on AI responses and training data,&amp;nbsp;and persistent staffing issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We met with &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rani-radhakrishnan-163615/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rani Radhakrishnan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PwC Principal, Technology Managed Services &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;AI, Data Analytics and Insights, to talk candidly about what’s working — and what’s holding back CIOs in their AI journey. We spoke ahead of her speaking engagement at &lt;a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/northamerica/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TechEx AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo North America&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, June 4 and 5, at the Santa Clara Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rani is especially attuned to some of the governance, data privacy and sovereignty issues that face enterprises, having spent many years in her career working with numerous clients in the health sector — an area where issues like privacy, data oversight and above all data accuracy are make-or-break aspects of technology deployments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not enough to just have a prompt engineer or a Python developer. … You still need the human in the loop to curate the right training data sets, review and address any bias in the outputs.” —Rani Radhakrishnan, PwC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-support-to-strategy-shifting-expectations-for-ai"&gt;From support to strategy: shifting expectations for AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rani said that there&amp;#8217;s a growing enthusiasm from PwC&amp;#8217;s clients for AI-powered managed services that can provide both business insights in every sector, and for the technology to be used more proactively, in so-called agentic roles where agents can independently act on data and user input; where autonomous AI agents can take action based on interactions with humans, access to data resources and automation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-launches-ai-agent-operating-system-enterprises.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PwC&amp;#8217;s agent OS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a modular AI platform that connects systems and scales intelligent agents into workflows, many times faster than traditional computing methods. It&amp;#8217;s an example of how PwC responds to the demand for AI from its clients, many of whom see the potential of this new technology, but lack the in-house expertise and staff to act on their needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on the sector of the organization, the interest in AI can come from many different places in the business. Proactive monitoring of physical or digital systems; predictive maintenance in manufacturing or engineering; or cost efficiencies won by automation in complex, customer-facing environments, are just a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But regardless of where AI can bring value, most companies don&amp;#8217;t yet have in-house the range of skills and people necessary for effective AI deployment — or at least, deployments that achieve ROI and don&amp;#8217;t come with significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-medium"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-106700" height="300" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rani-radhakrishnan-pwc-300x300.jpeg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not enough to just have a prompt engineer or a Python developer,&amp;#8221; Rani said. &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;ve got to put all of these together in a very structured manner, and you still need the human in the loop to curate the right training data sets, review and address any bias in the outputs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cleaning-house-the-data-challenge-behind-ai"&gt;Cleaning house: the data challenge behind AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rani says that effective AI implementations need a mix of technical skills — data engineering, data science, prompt engineering — in combination with an organization&amp;#8217;s domain expertise. Internal domain expertise can define the right outcomes, and technical staff can cover the responsible AI practices, like data collation and governance, and confirm that AI systems work responsibly and within company guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In order to get the most value out of AI, an organization has to get the underlying data right,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;I don’t know of a single company that says its data is in great shape … you&amp;#8217;ve got to get it into the right structure and normalize it properly so you can query, analyze,&amp;nbsp;and annotate it and identify emerging trends.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of the work enterprises have to put in for effective AI use is the observation for and correction of bias — in both output of AI systems and in the analysis of potential bias inherent in training and operational data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important that as part of the underlying architecture of AI systems, teams apply stringent data sanitization, normalization, and data annotation processes. The latter requires &amp;#8220;a lot of human effort,&amp;#8221; Rani said, and the skilled personnel required are among the new breed of data professionals that are beginning to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If data and personnel challenges can be overcome, then the feedback loop makes the possible outcomes from generative AI really valuable, Rani said. &amp;#8220;Now you have an opportunity with AI prompts to go back and refine the answer that you get. And that’s what makes it so unique and so valuable because now you’re training the model to answer the questions the way you want them answered.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CIOs, the shift isn’t just about tech enablement. It’s about integrating AI into enterprise architecture, aligning with business strategy, and managing the governance risks that come with scale. CIOs are becoming AI stewards — architecting not just systems, but trust and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s only been a few years since AI emerged from its roots in academic computer science research, so it&amp;#8217;s understandable that today&amp;#8217;s enterprise organizations are, to a certain extent, feeling their way towards realizing AI&amp;#8217;s potential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a new playbook is emerging — one that helps CIOs access the value held in their data reserves, in business strategy, operational improvement, customer-facing experiences and a dozen more areas of the business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a company that&amp;#8217;s steeped in experience with clients large and small from all over the world, PwC is one of the leading choices that decision-makers turn to, to begin or rationalize and direct their existing AI journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ai-enables-shift-from-enablement-to-strategic-leadership/"&gt;AI enables shift from enablement to strategic leadership&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com"&gt;AI News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;CIOs and business leaders know they’re sitting on a goldmine of business data. And while traditional tools such as business intelligence platforms and statistical analysis software can effectively surface insights from the collated data resources, doing so quickly, in real-time and at scale remains an unsolved challenge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprise AI, when deployed responsibly and at scale, can turn these bottlenecks into opportunities. Acting quickly on data, even ‘live’ (during a customer interaction, for example), is one of the technology&amp;#8217;s abilities, as is scalability: AI can process large amounts of information from disparate sources almost as easily as it can summarize a one-page spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But deploying an AI solution in the modern enterprise isn&amp;#8217;t simple. It takes structure, trust and the right talent. Along with the practical implementation challenges, using AI brings its own challenges, such as data governance, the need to impose guardrails on AI responses and training data,&amp;nbsp;and persistent staffing issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We met with &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rani-radhakrishnan-163615/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rani Radhakrishnan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PwC Principal, Technology Managed Services &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;AI, Data Analytics and Insights, to talk candidly about what’s working — and what’s holding back CIOs in their AI journey. We spoke ahead of her speaking engagement at &lt;a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/northamerica/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TechEx AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo North America&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, June 4 and 5, at the Santa Clara Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rani is especially attuned to some of the governance, data privacy and sovereignty issues that face enterprises, having spent many years in her career working with numerous clients in the health sector — an area where issues like privacy, data oversight and above all data accuracy are make-or-break aspects of technology deployments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not enough to just have a prompt engineer or a Python developer. … You still need the human in the loop to curate the right training data sets, review and address any bias in the outputs.” —Rani Radhakrishnan, PwC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-support-to-strategy-shifting-expectations-for-ai"&gt;From support to strategy: shifting expectations for AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rani said that there&amp;#8217;s a growing enthusiasm from PwC&amp;#8217;s clients for AI-powered managed services that can provide both business insights in every sector, and for the technology to be used more proactively, in so-called agentic roles where agents can independently act on data and user input; where autonomous AI agents can take action based on interactions with humans, access to data resources and automation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-launches-ai-agent-operating-system-enterprises.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PwC&amp;#8217;s agent OS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a modular AI platform that connects systems and scales intelligent agents into workflows, many times faster than traditional computing methods. It&amp;#8217;s an example of how PwC responds to the demand for AI from its clients, many of whom see the potential of this new technology, but lack the in-house expertise and staff to act on their needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on the sector of the organization, the interest in AI can come from many different places in the business. Proactive monitoring of physical or digital systems; predictive maintenance in manufacturing or engineering; or cost efficiencies won by automation in complex, customer-facing environments, are just a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But regardless of where AI can bring value, most companies don&amp;#8217;t yet have in-house the range of skills and people necessary for effective AI deployment — or at least, deployments that achieve ROI and don&amp;#8217;t come with significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-medium"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-106700" height="300" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rani-radhakrishnan-pwc-300x300.jpeg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not enough to just have a prompt engineer or a Python developer,&amp;#8221; Rani said. &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;ve got to put all of these together in a very structured manner, and you still need the human in the loop to curate the right training data sets, review and address any bias in the outputs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cleaning-house-the-data-challenge-behind-ai"&gt;Cleaning house: the data challenge behind AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rani says that effective AI implementations need a mix of technical skills — data engineering, data science, prompt engineering — in combination with an organization&amp;#8217;s domain expertise. Internal domain expertise can define the right outcomes, and technical staff can cover the responsible AI practices, like data collation and governance, and confirm that AI systems work responsibly and within company guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In order to get the most value out of AI, an organization has to get the underlying data right,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;I don’t know of a single company that says its data is in great shape … you&amp;#8217;ve got to get it into the right structure and normalize it properly so you can query, analyze,&amp;nbsp;and annotate it and identify emerging trends.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of the work enterprises have to put in for effective AI use is the observation for and correction of bias — in both output of AI systems and in the analysis of potential bias inherent in training and operational data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important that as part of the underlying architecture of AI systems, teams apply stringent data sanitization, normalization, and data annotation processes. The latter requires &amp;#8220;a lot of human effort,&amp;#8221; Rani said, and the skilled personnel required are among the new breed of data professionals that are beginning to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If data and personnel challenges can be overcome, then the feedback loop makes the possible outcomes from generative AI really valuable, Rani said. &amp;#8220;Now you have an opportunity with AI prompts to go back and refine the answer that you get. And that’s what makes it so unique and so valuable because now you’re training the model to answer the questions the way you want them answered.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

CIOs are becoming AI stewards — architecting not just systems, but trust and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

Kieran’s 25+ years in the sector mean that as well as speaking authoritatively on all matters cybersecurity, his most recent roles include advising Deloitte clients on many issues around cybersecurity when using AI in business applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The majority of organisations have in place at least the bare minimum of cybersecurity, and thankfully, in most cases, operate a decently comprehensive raft of cybersecurity measures that cover off communications, data storage, and perimeter defences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in the last couple of years, AI has changed the picture, both in terms of how companies can leverage the technology internally, and in how AI is used in cybersecurity – in advanced detection, and in the new ways the tech is used by bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology/articles/ai-for-cybersecurity-benefits-pitfalls.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cybersecurity tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AI can be used in network anomaly detection and the smart spotting of phishing messages, among other uses. As a &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/consulting/services/artificial-intelligence-and-data.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;business enabler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AI means that the enterprise has to be proactive to ensure AI is used responsibly, balancing the innovation AI offers with privacy, data sovereignty, and risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Considered a relatively new area, AI, smart automation, data governance and security all inhabit a niche at present. But given the growing presence of AI in the enterprise, those niches are set to become mainstream issues: problems, solutions, and advice that will need to be observed in every organisation, sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-governance-and-risk"&gt;Governance and risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Integrating AI into business processes isn&amp;#8217;t solely about the technology and methods for its deployment. Internal processes will need to change to make best use of AI, and to better protect the business that&amp;#8217;s using AI daily. Kieran draws a parallel to earlier changes made necessary by new technologies: “I would correlate [AI] with cloud adoption where it was a fairly significant shift. People understood the advantages of it and were moving in that direction, although sometimes it took them more time than others to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those changes mean casting the net wide, to encompass the update of governance frameworks, establishing secure architectures, even leveraging a new generation of specialists to ensure AI and the data associated with it are used safely and responsibly. Companies actively using AI have to detect and correct bias, test for hallucinations, impose guardrails, manage where, and by whom AI is used, and more. As Kieran puts it: “You probably weren’t doing a lot of testing for hallucination, bias, toxicity, data poisoning, model vulnerabilities, etc. That now has to be part of your process.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-medium"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-106708" height="200" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kieran-norton-300x200.png" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are big subjects, and for the fuller picture, we advocate that readers attend the two talks at TechEx North America that Kieran&amp;#8217;s to give. He&amp;#8217;ll be exploring both sides of the AI coin – issues around AI deployment for the business, and the methods that companies can implement to deter and detect the new breed of AI-powered malware and attack vectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-right-use-cases"&gt;The right use-cases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kieran advocates that companies start with smaller, lower-risk AI implementations. While some of the first sightings of AI &amp;#8216;in the wild&amp;#8217; have been chatbots, he was quick to differentiate between a chatbot that can intelligently answer questions from customers, and agents, which can take action by means of triggering interactions with the apps and services the business operates. “So there&amp;#8217;s a delineation […] chatbots have been one of the primary starting places […] As we get into agents and agentic, that changes the picture. It also changes the complexity and risk profile.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customer-facing agentic AI instances are indubitably higher risk, as a misstep can have &amp;nbsp;significant effects on a brand. “That&amp;#8217;s a higher risk scenario. Particularly if the agent is executing financial transactions or making determinations based on healthcare coverage […] that&amp;#8217;s not the first use case you want to try.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If you plug 5, 6, 10, 50, a hundred agents together, you&amp;#8217;re getting into a network of agency […] the interactions become quite complex and present different issues,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the issues around automation and system-to-system interfaces have been around for close on a decade. Data silos and RPA (robotic process automation) challenges are the hurdles enterprises have been trying to jump for several years. “You still have to know where your data is, know what data you have, have access to it […] The fundamentals are still true.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the AI era, fundamental questions about infrastructure, data visibility, security, and sovereignty are arguably more relevant. Any discussions about AI tend to circle around the same issues, which throws into relief Kieran&amp;#8217;s statements that a conversation about AI in the enterprise has to be wide-reaching and concern many of the operational and infrastructural underpinnings of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kieran therefore emphasises the importance of practicality, and a grounded assessment of need and ability as needing careful examination before AI can gain a foothold. “If you understand the use case […] you should have a pretty good idea of the ROI […] and therefore whether or not it&amp;#8217;s worth the pain and suffering to go through building it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Deloitte, AI is being put to use where there is a clear use case with a measurable return: in the initial triage-ing of SOC tickets. Here the AI acts as a Level I incident analysis engine. “We know how many tickets get generated a day […] if we can take 60 to 80% of the time out of the triage process, then that has a significant impact.” Given the technology&amp;#8217;s nascence, demarcating a specific area of operations where AI can be used acts as both prototype and proof of effectiveness. The AI is not customer-facing, and there are highly-qualified experts in their fields who can check and oversee the AI&amp;#8217;s deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kieran&amp;#8217;s message for business professionals investigating AI uses for their organisations was not to build an AI risk assessment and management programme from scratch. Instead, companies should evolve existing systems, have a clear understanding of each use-case, and avoid the trap of building for theoretical value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You shouldn&amp;#8217;t create another programme just for AI security on top of what you&amp;#8217;re already doing […] you should be modernising your programme to address the nuances associated with AI workloads.” Success in AI starts with clear, realistic goals built on solid foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If you plug 5, 6, 10, 50, a hundred agents together, you&amp;#8217;re getting into a network of agency […] the interactions become quite complex and present different issues,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the issues around automation and system-to-system interfaces have been around for close on a decade. Data silos and RPA (robotic process automation) challenges are the hurdles enterprises have been trying to jump for several years. “You still have to know where your data is, know what data you have, have access to it […] The fundamentals are still true.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the AI era, fundamental questions about infrastructure, data visibility, security, and sovereignty are arguably more relevant. Any discussions about AI tend to circle around the same issues, which throws into relief Kieran&amp;#8217;s statements that a conversation about AI in the enterprise has to be wide-reaching and concern many of the operational and infrastructural underpinnings of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kieran therefore emphasises the importance of practicality, and a grounded assessment of need and ability as needing careful examination before AI can gain a foothold. “If you understand the use case […] you should have a pretty good idea of the ROI […] and therefore whether or not it&amp;#8217;s worth the pain and suffering to go through building it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Deloitte, AI is being put to use where there is a clear use case with a measurable return: in the initial triage-ing of SOC tickets. Here the AI acts as a Level I incident analysis engine. “We know how many tickets get generated a day […] if we can take 60 to 80% of the time out of the triage process, then that has a significant impact.” Given the technology&amp;#8217;s nascence, demarcating a specific area of operations where AI can be used acts as both prototype and proof of effectiveness. The AI is not customer-facing, and there are highly-qualified experts in their fields who can check and oversee the AI&amp;#8217;s deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kieran&amp;#8217;s message for business professionals investigating AI uses for their organisations was not to build an AI risk assessment and management programme from scratch. Instead, companies should evolve existing systems, have a clear understanding of each use-case, and avoid the trap of building for theoretical value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You shouldn&amp;#8217;t create another programme just for AI security on top of what you&amp;#8217;re already doing […] you should be modernising your programme to address the nuances associated with AI workloads.” Success in AI starts with clear, realistic goals built on solid foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

You can read the rest of them &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/tag/whats-next-in-tech/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The way DARPA tells it, math is stuck in the past. In April, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency kicked off a &lt;a href="https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/expmath-exponential-mathematics"&gt;new initiative called expMath&lt;/a&gt;—short for Exponentiating Mathematics—that it hopes will speed up the rate of progress in a field of research that underpins a wide range of crucial real-world applications, from computer science to medicine to national security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Math is the source of huge impact, but it’s done more or less as it’s been done for centuries—by people standing at chalkboards,” DARPA program manager Patrick Shafto said in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbf4cZk4e2w"&gt;video introducing the initiative&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The modern world is built on mathematics. Math lets us model complex systems such as the way air flows around an aircraft, the way financial markets fluctuate, and the way blood flows through the heart. And breakthroughs in advanced mathematics can unlock new technologies such as cryptography, which is essential for private messaging and online banking, and data compression, which lets us shoot images and video across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But advances in math can be years in the making. DARPA wants to speed things up. The goal for expMath is to encourage mathematicians and artificial-intelligence researchers to develop what DARPA calls an AI coauthor, a tool that might break large, complex math problems into smaller, simpler ones that are easier to grasp and—so the thinking goes—quicker to solve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mathematicians have used computers for decades, to speed up calculations or check whether certain mathematical statements are true. The new vision is that AI might help them crack problems that were previously uncrackable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there’s a huge difference between AI that can solve the kinds of problems set in high school—math that the latest generation of models has already mastered—and AI that could (in theory) solve the kinds of problems that professional mathematicians spend careers chipping away at.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On one side are tools that might be able to automate certain tasks that math grads are employed to do; on the other are tools that might be able to push human knowledge beyond its existing limits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are three ways to think about that gulf.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/ AI needs more than just clever tricks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Large language models are not known to be good at math. They &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/18/1093440/what-causes-ai-hallucinate-chatbots/"&gt;make things up&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11brmiv/gaslighting_the_ai_into_225/"&gt;can be persuaded that 2 + 2 = 5&lt;/a&gt;. But newer versions of this tech, especially so-called large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI’s o3 and Anthropic’s Claude 4 Thinking, are far more capable—and that&amp;#8217;s got mathematicians excited.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, a number of LRMs, which try to solve a problem step by step rather than spit out the first result that comes to them, have achieved &lt;a href="https://www.vals.ai/benchmarks/aime-2025-04-18"&gt;high scores on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination&lt;/a&gt; (AIME), a test given to the top 5% of US high school math students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a handful of new hybrid models that combine LLMs with some kind of fact-checking system have also made breakthroughs. Emily de Oliveira Santos, a mathematician at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, points to Google DeepMind’s AlphaProof, a system that combines an LLM with DeepMind’s game-playing model AlphaZero, as one key milestone. Last year AlphaProof became the first computer program to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/07/25/1095315/google-deepminds-ai-systems-can-now-solve-complex-math-problems/"&gt;match the performance of a silver medallist at the International Math Olympiad&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most prestigious mathematics competitions in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in May, a Google DeepMind model called AlphaEvolve &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/14/1116438/google-deepminds-new-ai-uses-large-language-models-to-crack-real-world-problems/"&gt;discovered better results than anything humans had yet come up with&lt;/a&gt; for more than 50 unsolved mathematics puzzles and several real-world computer science problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The uptick in progress is clear. “GPT-4 couldn’t do math much beyond undergraduate level,” says de Oliveira Santos. “I remember testing it at the time of its release with a problem in topology, and it just couldn’t write more than a few lines without getting completely lost.” But when she gave the same problem to OpenAI’s o1, an LRM released in January, it nailed it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Does this mean such models are all set to become the kind of coauthor DARPA hopes for? Not necessarily, she says: “Math Olympiad problems often involve being able to carry out clever tricks, whereas research problems are much more explorative and often have many, many more moving pieces.” Success at one type of problem-solving may not carry over to another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others agree. Martin Bridson, a mathematician at the University of Oxford, thinks the Math Olympiad result is a great achievement. “On the other hand, I don’t find it mind-blowing,” he says. “It’s not a change of paradigm in the sense that ‘Wow, I thought machines would never be able to do that.’ I expected machines to be able to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because even though the problems in the Math Olympiad—and similar high school or undergraduate tests like AIME—are hard, there’s a pattern to a lot of them. “We have training camps to train high school kids to do them,” says Bridson. “And if you can train a large number of people to do those problems, why shouldn’t you be able to train a machine to do them?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sergei Gukov, a mathematician at the California Institute of Technology who coaches Math Olympiad teams, points out that the style of question does not change too much between competitions. New problems are set each year, but they can be solved with the same old tricks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sure, the specific problems didn’t appear before,” says Gukov. “But they’re very close—just a step away from zillions of things you have already seen. You immediately realize, ‘Oh my gosh, there are so many similarities—I’m going to apply the same tactic.’” As hard as competition-level math is, kids and machines alike can be taught how to beat it.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That’s not true for most unsolved math problems. Bridson is president of the Clay Mathematics Institute, a nonprofit US-based research organization best known for setting up the Millenium Prize Problems in 2000—seven of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics, with a $1 million prize to be awarded to the first person to solve each of them. (One problem, the Poincaré conjecture, was solved in 2010; the others, which include P versus NP and the Riemann hypothesis, remain open). “We’re very far away from AI being able to say anything serious about any of those problems,” says Bridson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet it’s hard to know exactly how far away, because many of the existing benchmarks used to evaluate progress are maxed out. The best new models already outperform most humans on tests like AIME.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get a better idea of what existing systems can and cannot do, a startup called Epoch AI has created a new test called FrontierMath, released in December. Instead of co-opting math tests developed for humans, Epoch AI worked with more than 60 mathematicians around the world to come up with a &lt;a href="https://epoch.ai/frontiermath/benchmark-problems:"&gt;set of math problems&lt;/a&gt; from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FrontierMath is designed to probe the limits of what today’s AI can do. None of the problems have been seen before and the majority are being kept secret to avoid contaminating training data. Each problem demands hours of work from expert mathematicians to solve—if they can solve it at all: some of the problems require specialist knowledge to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FrontierMath is set to become an industry standard. It’s not yet as popular as AIME, says de Oliveira Santos, who helped develop some of the problems: “But I expect this to not hold for much longer, since existing benchmarks are very close to being saturated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On AIME, the best large language models (Anthropic’s Claude 4, OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini, Google DeepMind’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, X-AI’s Grok 3) now score around 90%. On FrontierMath, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/epochai_we-recently-completed-preliminary-evaluations-activity-7325188118750371840-Jof_/"&gt;04-mini scores 19% and Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 13%&lt;/a&gt;. That’s still remarkable, but there’s clear room for improvement.     &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FrontierMath should give the best sense yet just how fast AI is progressing at math. But there are some problems that are still too hard for computers to take on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/ AI needs to manage really vast sequences of steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Squint hard enough and in some ways math problems start to look the same: to solve them you need to take a sequence of steps from start to finish. The problem is finding those steps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Pretty much every math problem can be formulated as path-finding,” says Gukov. What makes some problems far harder than others is the number of steps on that path. “The difference between the Riemann hypothesis and high school math is that with high school math the paths that we’re looking for are short—10 steps, 20 steps, maybe 40 in the longest case.” The steps are also repeated between problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But to solve the Riemann hypothesis, we don’t have the steps, and what we’re looking for is a path that is extremely long”—maybe a million lines of computer proof, says Gukov.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finding very long sequences of steps can be thought of as a kind of complex game. It’s what DeepMind’s AlphaZero learned to do when it mastered Go and chess. A game of Go might only involve a few hundred moves. But to win, an AI must find a winning sequence of moves among a vast number of possible sequences. Imagine a number with 100 zeros at the end, says Gukov.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that’s still tiny compared with the number of possible sequences that could be involved in proving or disproving a very hard math problem: “A proof path with a thousand or a million moves involves a number with a thousand or a million zeros,” says Gukov.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No AI system can sift through that many possibilities. To address this, Gukov and his colleagues developed a system that shortens the length of a path by combining multiple moves into single supermoves. It’s like having boots that let you take giant strides: instead of taking 2,000 steps to walk a mile, you can now walk it in 20.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenge was figuring out which moves to replace with supermoves. In a series of experiments, the researchers came up with a system in which one reinforcement-learning model suggests new moves and a second model checks to see if those moves help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They used this approach to make a breakthrough in a math problem called the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, a puzzle that has been unsolved for 60 years. It’s a problem that every professional mathematician will know, says Gukov.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(An aside for math stans only: The AC conjecture states that a particular way of describing a type of set called a trivial group can be translated into a different but equivalent description with a certain sequence of steps. Most mathematicians think the AC conjecture is false, but nobody knows how to prove that. Gukov admits himself that it is an intellectual curiosity rather than a practical problem, but an important problem for mathematicians nonetheless.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gukov and his colleagues didn’t solve the AC conjecture, but they found that a counterexample (suggesting that the conjecture is false) proposed 40 years ago was itself false. “It’s been a major direction of attack for 40 years,” says Gukov. With the help of AI, they showed that this direction was in fact a dead end.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ruling out possible counterexamples is a worthwhile thing,” says Bridson. “It can close off blind alleys, something you might spend a year of your life exploring.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;True, Gukov checked off just one piece of one esoteric puzzle. But he thinks the approach will work in any scenario where you need to find a long sequence of unknown moves, and he now plans to try it out on other problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Maybe it will lead to something that will help AI in general,” he says. “Because it’s teaching reinforcement learning models to go beyond their training. To me it’s basically about thinking outside of the box—miles away, megaparsecs away.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/ Can AI ever provide real insight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thinking outside the box is exactly what mathematicians need to solve hard problems. Math is often thought to involve robotic, step-by-step procedures. But advanced math is an experimental pursuit, involving trial and error and flashes of insight.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That’s where tools like AlphaEvolve come in. Google DeepMind’s latest model asks an LLM to generate code to solve a particular math problem. A second model then evaluates the proposed solutions, picks the best, and sends them back to the LLM to be improved. After hundreds of rounds of trial and error, AlphaEvolve was able to come up with solutions to a wide range of math problems that were better than anything people had yet come up with. But it can also work as a collaborative tool: at any step, humans can share their own insight with the LLM, prompting it with specific instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This kind of exploration is key to advanced mathematics. “I’m often looking for interesting phenomena and pushing myself in a certain direction,” says Geordie Williamson, a mathematician at the University of Sydney in Australia. “Like: ‘Let me look down this little alley. Oh, I found something!’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Williamson worked with Meta on an AI tool called PatternBoost, designed to support this kind of exploration. PatternBoost can take a mathematical idea or statement and generate similar ones. “It’s like: ‘Here’s a bunch of interesting things. I don’t know what’s going on, but can you produce more interesting things like that?’” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such brainstorming is essential work in math. It’s how new ideas get conjured. Take the icosahedron, says Williamson: “It’s a beautiful example of this, which I kind of keep coming back to in my own work.” The icosahedron is a 20-sided 3D object where all the faces are triangles (think of a 20-sided die). The icosahedron is the largest of a family of exactly five such objects: there’s the tetrahedron (four sides), cube (six sides), octahedron (eight sides), and dodecahedron (12 sides).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, the fact that there are exactly five of these objects was proved by mathematicians in ancient Greece. “At the time that this theorem was proved, the icosahedron didn’t exist,” says Williamson. “You can’t go to a quarry and find it—someone found it in their mind. And the icosahedron goes on to have a profound effect on mathematics. It’s still influencing us today in very, very profound ways.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Williamson, the exciting potential of tools like PatternBoost is that they might help people discover future mathematical objects like the icosahedron that go on to shape the way math is done. But we’re not there yet. “AI can contribute in a meaningful way to research-level problems,” he says. “But we&amp;#8217;re certainly not getting inundated with new theorems at this stage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that machines still lack what you might call intuition or creative thinking. Williamson sums it up like this: We now have AI that can beat humans when it knows the rules of the game. “But it’s one thing for a computer to play Go at a superhuman level and another thing for the computer to invent the game of Go.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that applies to advanced mathematics,” he says. “Breakthroughs come from a new way of thinking about something, which is akin to finding completely new moves in a game. And I don’t really think we understand where those really brilliant moves in deep mathematics come from.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps AI tools like AlphaEvolve and PatternBoost are best thought of as advance scouts for human intuition. They can discover new directions and point out dead ends, saving mathematicians months or years of work. But the true breakthroughs will still come from the minds of people, as has been the case for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, at least. “There’s plenty of tech companies that tell us that won’t last long,” says Williamson. “But you know—we’ll see.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future.

But newer versions of this tech, especially so-called large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI’s o3 and Anthropic’s Claude 4 Thinking, are far more capable—and that&amp;#8217;s got mathematicians excited.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, a number of LRMs, which try to solve a problem step by step rather than spit out the first result that comes to them, have achieved &lt;a href="https://www.vals.ai/benchmarks/aime-2025-04-18"&gt;high scores on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination&lt;/a&gt; (AIME), a test given to the top 5% of US high school math students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a handful of new hybrid models that combine LLMs with some kind of fact-checking system have also made breakthroughs. Emily de Oliveira Santos, a mathematician at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, points to Google DeepMind’s AlphaProof, a system that combines an LLM with DeepMind’s game-playing model AlphaZero, as one key milestone. Last year AlphaProof became the first computer program to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/07/25/1095315/google-deepminds-ai-systems-can-now-solve-complex-math-problems/"&gt;match the performance of a silver medallist at the International Math Olympiad&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most prestigious mathematics competitions in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in May, a Google DeepMind model called AlphaEvolve &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/14/1116438/google-deepminds-new-ai-uses-large-language-models-to-crack-real-world-problems/"&gt;discovered better results than anything humans had yet come up with&lt;/a&gt; for more than 50 unsolved mathematics puzzles and several real-world computer science problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The uptick in progress is clear. “GPT-4 couldn’t do math much beyond undergraduate level,” says de Oliveira Santos. “I remember testing it at the time of its release with a problem in topology, and it just couldn’t write more than a few lines without getting completely lost.” But when she gave the same problem to OpenAI’s o1, an LRM released in January, it nailed it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Does this mean such models are all set to become the kind of coauthor DARPA hopes for? Not necessarily, she says: “Math Olympiad problems often involve being able to carry out clever tricks, whereas research problems are much more explorative and often have many, many more moving pieces.” Success at one type of problem-solving may not carry over to another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others agree. Martin Bridson, a mathematician at the University of Oxford, thinks the Math Olympiad result is a great achievement. “On the other hand, I don’t find it mind-blowing,” he says. “It’s not a change of paradigm in the sense that ‘Wow, I thought machines would never be able to do that.’ I expected machines to be able to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because even though the problems in the Math Olympiad—and similar high school or undergraduate tests like AIME—are hard, there’s a pattern to a lot of them. “We have training camps to train high school kids to do them,” says Bridson. “And if you can train a large number of people to do those problems, why shouldn’t you be able to train a machine to do them?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sergei Gukov, a mathematician at the California Institute of Technology who coaches Math Olympiad teams, points out that the style of question does not change too much between competitions. New problems are set each year, but they can be solved with the same old tricks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sure, the specific problems didn’t appear before,” says Gukov. “But they’re very close—just a step away from zillions of things you have already seen. You immediately realize, ‘Oh my gosh, there are so many similarities—I’m going to apply the same tactic.’” As hard as competition-level math is, kids and machines alike can be taught how to beat it.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That’s not true for most unsolved math problems. Bridson is president of the Clay Mathematics Institute, a nonprofit US-based research organization best known for setting up the Millenium Prize Problems in 2000—seven of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics, with a $1 million prize to be awarded to the first person to solve each of them. (One problem, the Poincaré conjecture, was solved in 2010; the others, which include P versus NP and the Riemann hypothesis, remain open). “We’re very far away from AI being able to say anything serious about any of those problems,” says Bridson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet it’s hard to know exactly how far away, because many of the existing benchmarks used to evaluate progress are maxed out. The best new models already outperform most humans on tests like AIME.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get a better idea of what existing systems can and cannot do, a startup called Epoch AI has created a new test called FrontierMath, released in December. Instead of co-opting math tests developed for humans, Epoch AI worked with more than 60 mathematicians around the world to come up with a &lt;a href="https://epoch.ai/frontiermath/benchmark-problems:"&gt;set of math problems&lt;/a&gt; from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FrontierMath is designed to probe the limits of what today’s AI can do. None of the problems have been seen before and the majority are being kept secret to avoid contaminating training data. Each problem demands hours of work from expert mathematicians to solve—if they can solve it at all: some of the problems require specialist knowledge to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FrontierMath is set to become an industry standard. It’s not yet as popular as AIME, says de Oliveira Santos, who helped develop some of the problems: “But I expect this to not hold for much longer, since existing benchmarks are very close to being saturated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On AIME, the best large language models (Anthropic’s Claude 4, OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini, Google DeepMind’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, X-AI’s Grok 3) now score around 90%. On FrontierMath, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/epochai_we-recently-completed-preliminary-evaluations-activity-7325188118750371840-Jof_/"&gt;04-mini scores 19% and Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 13%&lt;/a&gt;. That’s still remarkable, but there’s clear room for improvement.     &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FrontierMath should give the best sense yet just how fast AI is progressing at math. But there are some problems that are still too hard for computers to take on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/ AI needs to manage really vast sequences of steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Squint hard enough and in some ways math problems start to look the same: to solve them you need to take a sequence of steps from start to finish. The problem is finding those steps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Pretty much every math problem can be formulated as path-finding,” says Gukov. What makes some problems far harder than others is the number of steps on that path. “The difference between the Riemann hypothesis and high school math is that with high school math the paths that we’re looking for are short—10 steps, 20 steps, maybe 40 in the longest case.” The steps are also repeated between problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But to solve the Riemann hypothesis, we don’t have the steps, and what we’re looking for is a path that is extremely long”—maybe a million lines of computer proof, says Gukov.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finding very long sequences of steps can be thought of as a kind of complex game. It’s what DeepMind’s AlphaZero learned to do when it mastered Go and chess. A game of Go might only involve a few hundred moves. But to win, an AI must find a winning sequence of moves among a vast number of possible sequences. Imagine a number with 100 zeros at the end, says Gukov.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that’s still tiny compared with the number of possible sequences that could be involved in proving or disproving a very hard math problem: “A proof path with a thousand or a million moves involves a number with a thousand or a million zeros,” says Gukov.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No AI system can sift through that many possibilities. To address this, Gukov and his colleagues developed a system that shortens the length of a path by combining multiple moves into single supermoves. It’s like having boots that let you take giant strides: instead of taking 2,000 steps to walk a mile, you can now walk it in 20.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenge was figuring out which moves to replace with supermoves. In a series of experiments, the researchers came up with a system in which one reinforcement-learning model suggests new moves and a second model checks to see if those moves help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They used this approach to make a breakthrough in a math problem called the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, a puzzle that has been unsolved for 60 years. It’s a problem that every professional mathematician will know, says Gukov.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(An aside for math stans only: The AC conjecture states that a particular way of describing a type of set called a trivial group can be translated into a different but equivalent description with a certain sequence of steps. Most mathematicians think the AC conjecture is false, but nobody knows how to prove that. Gukov admits himself that it is an intellectual curiosity rather than a practical problem, but an important problem for mathematicians nonetheless.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gukov and his colleagues didn’t solve the AC conjecture, but they found that a counterexample (suggesting that the conjecture is false) proposed 40 years ago was itself false. “It’s been a major direction of attack for 40 years,” says Gukov. With the help of AI, they showed that this direction was in fact a dead end.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ruling out possible counterexamples is a worthwhile thing,” says Bridson. “It can close off blind alleys, something you might spend a year of your life exploring.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;True, Gukov checked off just one piece of one esoteric puzzle. But he thinks the approach will work in any scenario where you need to find a long sequence of unknown moves, and he now plans to try it out on other problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Maybe it will lead to something that will help AI in general,” he says. “Because it’s teaching reinforcement learning models to go beyond their training. To me it’s basically about thinking outside of the box—miles away, megaparsecs away.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/ Can AI ever provide real insight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thinking outside the box is exactly what mathematicians need to solve hard problems. Math is often thought to involve robotic, step-by-step procedures. But advanced math is an experimental pursuit, involving trial and error and flashes of insight.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That’s where tools like AlphaEvolve come in. Google DeepMind’s latest model asks an LLM to generate code to solve a particular math problem. A second model then evaluates the proposed solutions, picks the best, and sends them back to the LLM to be improved. After hundreds of rounds of trial and error, AlphaEvolve was able to come up with solutions to a wide range of math problems that were better than anything people had yet come up with. But it can also work as a collaborative tool: at any step, humans can share their own insight with the LLM, prompting it with specific instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This kind of exploration is key to advanced mathematics. “I’m often looking for interesting phenomena and pushing myself in a certain direction,” says Geordie Williamson, a mathematician at the University of Sydney in Australia. “Like: ‘Let me look down this little alley. Oh, I found something!’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Williamson worked with Meta on an AI tool called PatternBoost, designed to support this kind of exploration. PatternBoost can take a mathematical idea or statement and generate similar ones. “It’s like: ‘Here’s a bunch of interesting things. I don’t know what’s going on, but can you produce more interesting things like that?’” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such brainstorming is essential work in math. It’s how new ideas get conjured. Take the icosahedron, says Williamson: “It’s a beautiful example of this, which I kind of keep coming back to in my own work.” The icosahedron is a 20-sided 3D object where all the faces are triangles (think of a 20-sided die). The icosahedron is the largest of a family of exactly five such objects: there’s the tetrahedron (four sides), cube (six sides), octahedron (eight sides), and dodecahedron (12 sides).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, the fact that there are exactly five of these objects was proved by mathematicians in ancient Greece. “At the time that this theorem was proved, the icosahedron didn’t exist,” says Williamson. “You can’t go to a quarry and find it—someone found it in their mind. And the icosahedron goes on to have a profound effect on mathematics. It’s still influencing us today in very, very profound ways.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Williamson, the exciting potential of tools like PatternBoost is that they might help people discover future mathematical objects like the icosahedron that go on to shape the way math is done. But we’re not there yet. “AI can contribute in a meaningful way to research-level problems,” he says. “But we&amp;#8217;re certainly not getting inundated with new theorems at this stage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that machines still lack what you might call intuition or creative thinking. Williamson sums it up like this: We now have AI that can beat humans when it knows the rules of the game. “But it’s one thing for a computer to play Go at a superhuman level and another thing for the computer to invent the game of Go.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that applies to advanced mathematics,” he says. “Breakthroughs come from a new way of thinking about something, which is akin to finding completely new moves in a game. And I don’t really think we understand where those really brilliant moves in deep mathematics come from.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps AI tools like AlphaEvolve and PatternBoost are best thought of as advance scouts for human intuition. They can discover new directions and point out dead ends, saving mathematicians months or years of work. But the true breakthroughs will still come from the minds of people, as has been the case for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, at least. “There’s plenty of tech companies that tell us that won’t last long,” says Williamson. “But you know—we’ll see.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/04/1117753/whats-next-for-ai-and-math/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 08:21:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>10 Generative AI Key Concepts Explained (KDnuggets)</title><link>https://www.kdnuggets.com/10-generative-ai-key-concepts-explained</link><description>In this article we explore 10 generative AI concepts that are key to understanding, whether you are an engineer, user, or consumer of generative AI.</description><content:encoded>In this article we explore 10 generative AI concepts that are key to understanding, whether you are an engineer, user, or consumer of generative AI.</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.kdnuggets.com/10-generative-ai-key-concepts-explained</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 12:00:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Download: AI’s role in math, and calculating its energy footprint (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/04/1117829/the-download-ai-math-energy/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is today&amp;#8217;s edition of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://forms.technologyreview.com/newsletters/briefing-the-download/?_ga=2.179569122.736533416.1649661040-405833893.1649413289"&gt;The Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&amp;#8217;s going on in the world of technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for AI and math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modern world is built on mathematics. Math lets us model complex systems such as the way air flows around an aircraft, the way financial markets fluctuate, and the way blood flows through the heart. Mathematicians have used computers for decades, but the new vision is that AI might help them crack problems that were previously uncrackable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a huge difference between AI that can solve the kinds of problems set in high school—math that the latest generation of models has already mastered—and AI that could (in theory) solve the kinds of problems that professional mathematicians spend careers chipping away at.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com%2F2025%2F06%2F04%2F1117753%2Fwhats-next-for-ai-and-math%2F%3Futm_source%3Dthe_download%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dthe_download.unpaid.engagement%26utm_term%3D%253C%253C%2520Test%2520Class%2520%253E%253E%26utm_content%3D06-04-2025%26mc_cid%3D53af730c36%26mc_eid%3DUNIQID&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7C%7Cd4d82201ce6a416720b408dda3561d2f%7C961f23f8614c4756bafff1997766a273%7C1%7C0%7C638846312464631600%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=C1loMejlj%2BtV7vjfPGsy5g%2BN3qTebZ7BrrCWWCMklRs%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here are three ways to understand that gulf&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—James O&amp;#8217;Donnell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After working on it for months, my colleague Casey Crownhart and I finally saw our story on AI’s energy and emissions burden go live last week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial goal sounded simple: Calculate how much energy is used when we interact with a chatbot, then tally that up to understand why leaders in tech and politics are so keen to harness unprecedented levels of electricity to power AI and reshape our energy grids in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was, of course, not so simple. After speaking with dozens of researchers, we realized that the common understanding of AI’s energy appetite is full of holes.

&lt;p class="has-large-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; “This is scientific heaven. Or it used to be.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for AI and math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modern world is built on mathematics. Math lets us model complex systems such as the way air flows around an aircraft, the way financial markets fluctuate, and the way blood flows through the heart. Mathematicians have used computers for decades, but the new vision is that AI might help them crack problems that were previously uncrackable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a huge difference between AI that can solve the kinds of problems set in high school—math that the latest generation of models has already mastered—and AI that could (in theory) solve the kinds of problems that professional mathematicians spend careers chipping away at.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com%2F2025%2F06%2F04%2F1117753%2Fwhats-next-for-ai-and-math%2F%3Futm_source%3Dthe_download%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dthe_download.unpaid.engagement%26utm_term%3D%253C%253C%2520Test%2520Class%2520%253E%253E%26utm_content%3D06-04-2025%26mc_cid%3D53af730c36%26mc_eid%3DUNIQID&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7C%7Cd4d82201ce6a416720b408dda3561d2f%7C961f23f8614c4756bafff1997766a273%7C1%7C0%7C638846312464631600%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=C1loMejlj%2BtV7vjfPGsy5g%2BN3qTebZ7BrrCWWCMklRs%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here are three ways to understand that gulf&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working on it for months, my colleague Casey Crownhart and I finally saw our story on AI’s energy and emissions burden go live last week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial goal sounded simple: Calculate how much energy is used when we interact with a chatbot, then tally that up to understand why leaders in tech and politics are so keen to harness unprecedented levels of electricity to power AI and reshape our energy grids in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was, of course, not so simple. After speaking with dozens of researchers, we realized that the common understanding of AI’s energy appetite is full of holes.

&lt;p class="has-large-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; “This is scientific heaven. Or it used to be.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;—Tom Rapoport, a 77-year-old Harvard Medical School professor from Germany, expresses his sadness about Trump’s cuts to US science funding to the &lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F06%2F03%2Fus%2Ftrump-federal-spending-grants-scientists-leaving.html%3Fmc_cid%3D53af730c36%26mc_eid%3DUNIQID&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7C%7Cd4d82201ce6a416720b408dda3561d2f%7C961f23f8614c4756bafff1997766a273%7C1%7C0%7C638846312465077974%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=p%2BMpu4QS6%2FvyV5b782nhHHPCOj1lev7kifdZEUX4q90%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Frontier supercomputer came online in 2022, it marked the dawn of so-called exascale computing, with machines that can execute an exaflop—or a quintillion (1018) floating point operations a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, scientists have geared up to make more of these blazingly fast computers: several exascale machines are due to come online in the US and Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But speed itself isn’t the endgame.

Abstract: Speculative decoding relies on fast and accurate drafters. Recent state-of-the-art language models employ larger and larger vocabularies, which significantly slows down drafters. One promising approach to boost the efficiency of speculative decoding is to use drafters with smaller vocabularies. However, existing sampling methods cannot draw out-of-vocabulary tokens, creating a tradeoff between drafters' vocabulary size and acceptance rates. This paper introduces Redistributing Drafter Kernels (RDK), the first out-of-vocabulary sampler that effectively recovers acceptance rates by virtually restoring pruned target tokens. RDK leverages token-affinity priors to reallocate drafter mass towards high-overlap regions. We prove mathematically that RDK can achieve higher acceptance rates than vanilla and state-of-the-art samplers. We provide an efficient first-order approximation of RDK and prove that it reduces redistribution times from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$, enabling lightweight implementations for large vocabularies. Our experiments demonstrate that this linear-time RDK significantly boosts acceptance rates even after extreme pruning (removing more than 75% of the drafter's vocabulary), where existing samplers fail. RDK opens the door to extremely pruned drafters, which were previously impractical.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03206v1 Announce Type: new

RDK opens the door to extremely pruned drafters, which were previously impractical.</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03206</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Non-collective Calibrating Strategy for Time Series Forecasting (cs.LG updates on arXiv.org)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03176</link><description>arXiv:2506.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in time series forecasting. Despite these ongoing developments, the complex dynamics of time series make it challenging to establish the rule of thumb for designing the golden model architecture. In this study, we argue that refining existing advanced models through a universal calibrating strategy can deliver substantial benefits with minimal resource costs, as opposed to elaborating and training a new model from scratch. We first identify a multi-target learning conflict in the calibrating process, which arises when optimizing variables across time steps, leading to the underutilization of the model's learning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose an innovative calibrating strategy called Socket+Plug (SoP). This approach retains an exclusive optimizer and early-stopping monitor for each predicted target within each Plug while keeping the fully trained Socket backbone frozen. The model-agnostic nature of SoP allows it to directly calibrate the performance of any trained deep forecasting models, regardless of their specific architectures. Extensive experiments on various time series benchmarks and a spatio-temporal meteorological ERA5 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SoP, achieving up to a 22% improvement even when employing a simple MLP as the Plug (highlighted in Figure 1)</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03176v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03164v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Traffic congestion and collisions represent significant economic, environmental, and social challenges worldwide. Traditional traffic management approaches have shown limited success in addressing these complex, dynamic problems.

Abstract: The increasing presence of automated vehicles (AVs) presents new challenges for crash classification and safety analysis. Accurately identifying the SAE automation level involved in each crash is essential to understanding crash dynamics and system accountability. However, existing approaches often overlook automation-specific factors and lack model sophistication to capture distinctions between different SAE levels. To address this gap, this study evaluates the performance of three advanced tabular deep learning models MambaAttention, TabPFN, and TabTransformer for classifying SAE automation levels using structured crash data from Texas (2024), covering 4,649 cases categorized as Assisted Driving (SAE Level 1), Partial Automation (SAE Level 2), and Advanced Automation (SAE Levels 3-5 combined). Following class balancing using SMOTEENN, the models were trained and evaluated on a unified dataset of 7,300 records. MambaAttention demonstrated the highest overall performance (F1-scores: 88% for SAE 1, 97% for SAE 2, and 99% for SAE 3-5), while TabPFN excelled in zero-shot inference with high robustness for rare crash categories. In contrast, TabTransformer underperformed, particularly in detecting Partial Automation crashes (F1-score: 55%), suggesting challenges in modeling shared human-system control dynamics. These results highlight the capability of deep learning models tailored for tabular data to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automation-level classification. Integrating such models into crash analysis frameworks can support policy development, AV safety evaluation, and regulatory decisions, especially in distinguishing high-risk conditions for mid- and high-level automation technologies.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03160v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for "usefulness", an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators on real-world applications, new test scenarios are introduced upon which 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5 percent range for the 95 percent confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03159v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Deep learning models frequently encounter feature uncertainty in diverse learning scenarios, significantly impacting their performance and reliability. This challenge is particularly complex in multi-modal scenarios, where models must integrate information from different sources with inherent uncertainties. We propose Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Learning (DUAL), a unified framework that effectively handles feature uncertainty in both single-modal and multi-modal scenarios. DUAL introduces three key innovations: Dynamic Feature Uncertainty Modeling, which continuously refines uncertainty estimates through joint consideration of feature characteristics and learning dynamics; Adaptive Distribution-Aware Modulation, which maintains balanced feature distributions through dynamic sample influence adjustment; and Uncertainty-aware Cross-Modal Relationship Learning, which explicitly models uncertainties in cross-modal interactions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate DUAL's effectiveness across multiple domains: in computer vision tasks, it achieves substantial improvements of 7.1% accuracy on CIFAR-10, 6.5% accuracy on CIFAR-100, and 2.3% accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet; in multi-modal learning, it demonstrates consistent gains of 4.1% accuracy on CMU-MOSEI and 2.8% accuracy on CMU-MOSI for sentiment analysis, while achieving 1.4% accuracy improvements on MISR. The code will be available on GitHub soon.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03158v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence has enabled a diversity of applications that bridge the gap between digital and physical worlds. As physical environments are too complex to model through a single information acquisition approach, it is crucial to fuse multimodal data generated by different sources, such as sensors, devices, systems, and people, to solve a problem in the real world. Unfortunately, it is neither applicable nor sustainable to deploy new resources to collect original data from scratch for every problem. Thus, when data is inadequate in the domain of problem, it is vital to fuse knowledge from multimodal data that is already available in other domains. We call this cross-domain knowledge fusion. Existing research focus on fusing multimodal data in a single domain, supposing the knowledge from different datasets is intrinsically aligned; however, this assumption may not hold in the scenarios of cross-domain knowledge fusion. In this paper, we formally define the cross-domain multimodal data fusion problem, discussing its unique challenges, differences and advantages beyond data fusion in a single domain. We propose a four-layer framework, consisting of Domains, Links, Models and Data layers, answering three key questions: "what to fuse", "why can be fused", and "how to fuse". The Domains Layer selects relevant data from different domains for a given problem. The Links Layer reveals the philosophy of knowledge alignment beyond specific model structures. The Models Layer provides two knowledge fusion paradigms based on the fundamental mechanisms for processing data. The Data Layer turns data of different structures, resolutions, scales and distributions into a consistent representation that can be fed into an AI model. With this framework, we can design end-to-end solutions that fuse cross-domain multimodal data effectively for solving real-world problems.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03155v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Classifier free guidance has shown strong potential in diffusion-based reinforcement learning. However, existing methods rely on joint training of the guidance module and the diffusion model, which can be suboptimal during the early stages when the guidance is inaccurate and provides noisy learning signals. In offline RL, guidance depends solely on offline data: observations, actions, and rewards, and is independent of the policy module's behavior, suggesting that joint training is not required. This paper proposes modular training methods that decouple the guidance module from the diffusion model, based on three key findings:
  Guidance Necessity: We explore how the effectiveness of guidance varies with the training stage and algorithm choice, uncovering the roles of guidance and diffusion. A lack of good guidance in the early stage presents an opportunity for optimization.
  Guidance-First Diffusion Training: We introduce a method where the guidance module is first trained independently as a value estimator, then frozen to guide the diffusion model using classifier-free reward guidance. This modularization reduces memory usage, improves computational efficiency, and enhances both sample efficiency and final performance.
  Cross-Module Transferability: Applying two independently trained guidance models, one during training and the other during inference, can significantly reduce normalized score variance (e.g., reducing IQR by 86%). We show that guidance modules trained with one algorithm (e.g., IDQL) can be directly reused with another (e.g., DQL), with no additional training required, demonstrating baseline-level performance as well as strong modularity and transferability.
  We provide theoretical justification and empirical validation on bullet D4RL benchmarks. Our findings suggest a new paradigm for offline RL: modular, reusable, and composable training pipelines.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03154v1 Announce Type: new

To fill these gaps, we present \textbf{\benchname{}}, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules.

Abstract: This paper investigates a joint phase design and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to optimize average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), making it fall within the scope of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\Theta$ is employed to optimize RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize subcarrier allocation indicater more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, including the number of backlogged packets in buffers and the current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03586v1 Announce Type: new

To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\Theta$ is employed to optimize RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize subcarrier allocation indicater more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, including the number of backlogged packets in buffers and the current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03586</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>SUMO-MCP: Leveraging the Model Context Protocol for Autonomous Traffic Simulation and Optimization (cs.AI updates on arXiv.org)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03548</link><description>arXiv:2506.03548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic simulation tools, such as SUMO, are essential for urban mobility research. However, such tools remain challenging for users due to complex manual workflows involving network download, demand generation, simulation setup, and result analysis. In this paper, we introduce SUMO-MCP, a novel platform that not only wraps SUMO' s core utilities into a unified tool suite but also provides additional auxiliary utilities for common preprocessing and postprocessing tasks. Using SUMO-MCP, users can issue simple natural-language prompts to generate traffic scenarios from OpenStreetMap data, create demand from origin-destination matrices or random patterns, run batch simulations with multiple signal-control strategies, perform comparative analyses with automated reporting, and detect congestion for signal-timing optimization. Furthermore, the platform allows flexible custom workflows by dynamically combining exposed SUMO tools without additional coding. Experiments demonstrate that SUMO-MCP significantly makes traffic simulation more accessible and reliable for researchers. We will release code for SUMO-MCP at https://github.com/ycycycl/SUMO-MCP in the future.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03548v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) agents lack authentic human psychological processes necessary for genuine digital twins and social AI applications. To address this limitation, we present a computational implementation of Global Workspace Theory (GNWT) that integrates human cognitive architecture principles into LLM agents, creating specialized sub-agents for emotion, memory, social norms, planning, and goal-tracking coordinated through a global workspace mechanism. However, authentic digital twins require accurate personality initialization. We therefore develop a novel adventure-based personality test that evaluates true personality through behavioral choices within interactive scenarios, bypassing self-presentation bias found in traditional assessments. Building on these innovations, our CogniPair platform enables digital twins to engage in realistic simulated dating interactions and job interviews before real encounters, providing bidirectional cultural fit assessment for both romantic compatibility and workplace matching. Validation using 551 GNWT-Agents and Columbia University Speed Dating dataset demonstrates 72% correlation with human attraction patterns, 77.8% match prediction accuracy, and 74% agreement in human validation studies. This work advances psychological authenticity in LLM agents and establishes a foundation for intelligent dating platforms and HR technology solutions.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03543v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The quantification of social science remains a longstanding challenge, largely due to the philosophical nature of its foundational theories. Although quantum computing has advanced rapidly in recent years, its relevance to social theory remains underexplored. Most existing research focuses on micro-cognitive models or philosophical analogies, leaving a gap in system-level applications of quantum principles to the analysis of social systems. This study addresses that gap by proposing a theoretical and computational framework that combines quantum mechanics with Generative AI to simulate the emergence and evolution of social norms. Drawing on core quantum concepts--such as superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic measurement--this research models society as a dynamic, uncertain system and sets up five ideal-type experiments. These scenarios are simulated using 25 generative agents, each assigned evolving roles as compliers, resistors, or enforcers. Within a simulated environment monitored by a central observer (the Watcher), agents interact, respond to surveillance, and adapt to periodic normative disruptions. These interactions allow the system to self-organize under external stress and reveal emergent patterns. Key findings show that quantum principles, when integrated with generative AI, enable the modeling of uncertainty, emergence, and interdependence in complex social systems. Simulations reveal patterns including convergence toward normative order, the spread of resistance, and the spontaneous emergence of new equilibria in social rules. In conclusion, this study introduces a novel computational lens that lays the groundwork for a quantum-informed social theory. It offers interdisciplinary insights into how society can be understood not just as a structure to observe but as a dynamic system to simulate and redesign through quantum technologies.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03503v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of reinforcement learning (RL) policies in high-stakes environments requires not only formal verification but also interpretability and targeted falsification. While model checking provides formal guarantees, its effectiveness is limited by abstraction quality and the completeness of the underlying trajectory dataset. We propose a hybrid framework that integrates (1) explainability, (2) model checking, and (3) risk-guided falsification to achieve both rigor and coverage. Our approach begins by constructing a human-interpretable abstraction of the RL policy using Comprehensible Abstract Policy Summarization (CAPS). This abstract graph, derived from offline trajectories, is both verifier-friendly, semantically meaningful, and can be used as input to Storm probabilistic model checker to verify satisfaction of temporal safety specifications. If the model checker identifies a violation, it will return an interpretable counterexample trace by which the policy fails the safety requirement. However, if no violation is detected, we cannot conclude satisfaction due to potential limitation in the abstraction and coverage of the offline dataset. In such cases, we estimate associated risk during model checking to guide a falsification strategy that prioritizes searching in high-risk states and regions underrepresented in the trajectory dataset. We further provide PAC-style guarantees on the likelihood of uncovering undetected violations. Finally, we incorporate a lightweight safety shield that switches to a fallback policy at runtime when such a risk exceeds a threshold, facilitating failure mitigation without retraining.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03469v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Agentic workflows -- where multiple large language model (LLM) instances interact to solve tasks -- are increasingly built on feedback mechanisms, where one model evaluates and critiques another. Despite the promise of feedback-driven improvement, the stability of agentic workflows rests on the reliability of the judge. However, judges may hallucinate information, exhibit bias, or act adversarially -- introducing critical vulnerabilities into the workflow. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of agentic workflows under deceptive or misleading feedback. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for analyzing judge behavior, along axes of intent (from constructive to malicious) and knowledge (from parametric-only to retrieval-augmented systems). Using this taxonomy, we construct a suite of judge behaviors and develop WAFER-QA, a new benchmark with critiques grounded in retrieved web evidence to evaluate robustness of agentic workflows against factually supported adversarial feedback. We reveal that even strongest agents are vulnerable to persuasive yet flawed critiques -- often switching correct answers after a single round of misleading feedback. Taking a step further, we study how model predictions evolve over multiple rounds of interaction, revealing distinct behavioral patterns between reasoning and non-reasoning models. Our findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in feedback-based workflows and offer guidance for building more robust agentic systems.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03332v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We study how linear orders can be employed to realise choice functions for which the set of potential choices is restricted, i.e., the possible choice is not possible among the full powerset of all alternatives. In such restricted settings, constructing a choice function via a relation on the alternatives is not always possible. However, we show that one can always construct a choice function via a linear order on sets of alternatives, even when a fallback value is encoded as the minimal element in the linear order. The axiomatics of such choice functions are presented for the general case and the case of union-closed input restrictions. Restricted choice structures have applications in knowledge representation and reasoning, and here we discuss their applications for theory change and abstract argumentation.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03315v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to support our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions -- their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this perspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We do so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria -- formal rules that answer the questions "When are two AI systems the same?" and "When does an AI system persist, despite change?" Building on Carrara and Vermaas' account of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness provides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of these artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical make-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their trustworthiness profiles -- the collection of capabilities that the systems must uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their effectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the identity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical context of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a solid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal discussions about these artifacts.</description><content:encoded>arXiv:2506.03233v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: This paper presents Q-ARDNS-Multi, an advanced multi-agent quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) framework that extends the ARDNS-FN-Quantum model, where Q-ARDNS-Multi stands for "Quantum Adaptive Reward-Driven Neural Simulator - Multi-Agent". It integrates quantum circuits with RY gates, meta-cognitive adaptation, and multi-agent coordination mechanisms for complex 3D environments. Q-ARDNS-Multi leverages a 2-qubit quantum circuit for action selection, a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition, a shared memory module for agent cooperation, and adaptive exploration strategies modulated by reward variance and intrinsic motivation. Evaluated in a $10 \times 10 \times 3$ GridWorld environment with two agents over 5000 episodes, Q-ARDNS-Multi achieves success rates of 99.6\% and 99.5\% for Agents 0 and 1, respectively, outperforming Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) in terms of success rate, stability, navigation efficiency, and collision avoidance. The framework records mean rewards of $-304.2891 \pm 756.4636$ and $-295.7622 \pm 752.7103$, averaging 210 steps to goal, demonstrating its robustness in dynamic settings. Comprehensive analyses, including learning curves, reward distributions, statistical tests, and computational efficiency evaluations, highlight the contributions of quantum circuits and meta-cognitive adaptation.

If he goes forward, it would be the first major commercial investment in one of medicine’s most fraught ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1929340369457848561"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; on X June 2, Armstrong announced he was looking for gene-editing scientists and bioinformatics specialists to form a founding team for an “embryo editing” effort targeting an unmet medical need, such as a genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think the time is right for the defining company in the US to be built in this area,” Armstrong posted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The announcement from a deep-pocketed backer is a striking shift for a field considered taboo following the 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/25/138962/exclusive-chinese-scientists-are-creating-crispr-babies/"&gt;birth of the world’s first genetically edited children in China&lt;/a&gt;—a secretive experiment that led to international outrage and prison time for the lead scientist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Dieter Egli, a gene-editing scientist at Columbia University whose team has briefed Armstrong, his plans may be motivated in part by recent improvements in editing technology that have opened up a safer, more precise way to change the DNA of embryos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That technique, called base editing, can deftly change a single DNA letter. Earlier methods, on the other hand, actually cut the double helix, damaging it and causing whole genes to disappear. “We know much better now what to do,” says Egli. “It doesn’t mean the work is all done, but it’s a very different game now—entirely different.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoestring budget&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embryo editing, which ultimately aims to produce humans with genes tailored by design, is an idea that has been heavily stigmatized and starved of funding. While it&amp;#8217;s legal to study embryos in the lab, actually producing a gene-edited baby is flatly illegal in most countries.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, the CRISPR baby ban operates via a law that forbids the Food and Drug Administration from considering, or even acknowledging, any application it gets to attempt a gene-edited baby. But that rule could be changed, especially if scientists can demonstrate a compelling use of the technique—or perhaps if a billionaire lobbies for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his post, Armstrong included an image of a seven-year-old Pew Research Center poll showing Americans were strongly favorable to altering a baby’s genes if it could treat disease, although the same poll found most opposed experimentation on embryos.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, no US company has openly pursued embryo editing, and the federal government doesn’t fund studies on embryos at all. Instead, research on gene editing in embryos has been carried forward in the US by just two academic centers, Egli’s and one at the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Those efforts have operated on a shoestring, held together by private grants and university funds. Researchers at those centers said they support the idea of a well-financed company that could advance the technology. “We would honestly welcome that,” says Paula Amato, a fertility doctor at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University and the past president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“More research is needed, and that takes people and money,” she says, adding that she doesn’t mind if it comes from “tech bros.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Editing embryos can, in theory, be used to correct genetic errors likely to cause serious childhood conditions. But since in most cases genetic testing of embryos can also be used to avoid those errors, many argue it will be hard to find a true unmet need where the DNA-altering technique is actually necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, it&amp;#8217;s easy to conclude that the bigger market for the technology would be to intervene in embryos in ways that &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/22/1096458/crispr-gene-editing-babies-evolution/"&gt;could make humans resistant to common conditions,&lt;/a&gt; such as heart disease or Alzheimer’s. But that is more controversial because it’s a type of enhancement, and the changes would also be passed through the generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only last week, several biotech trade and academic groups demanded&lt;a href="https://alliancerm.org/press-release/moratorium-on-hhge/"&gt; a 10-year moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on heritable human genome editing, saying the technology has few real medical uses and “introduces long-term risks with unknown consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They said the ability to “program” desired traits or eliminate bad ones risked a new form of “eugenics,” one that would have the effect of “potentially altering the course of evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No limits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Armstrong did not reply to an email from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; seeking comment about his plans. Nor did his company Coinbase, a cryptocurrency trading platform that went public in 2021 and is the source of his fortune, estimated at $10 billion by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The billionaire is already part of a wave of tech entrepreneurs who’ve made a splash in science and biology by laying down outsize investments, sometimes in far-out ideas. Armstrong previously cofounded&lt;a href="http://newlimit.com/"&gt; New Limit&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; calls a “&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-06/brian-armstrong-s-human-life-extension-venture-raises-fresh-cash"&gt;life extension venture&lt;/a&gt;” and which this year raised a further $130 million to explore methods to&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/25/1061644/how-to-be-young-again/"&gt; reprogram old cells into an embryonic-like state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He started that company with Blake Byers, an investor who has said a significant portion of global GDP should be spent on “&lt;a href="https://x.com/byersblake/status/1902048579612766428"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt;” research, including biotech approaches and ways of uploading human minds to computers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, starting late last year, Armstrong began publicly telegraphing his interest in exploring a new venture, this time connected to assisted reproduction. In December, he&lt;a href="https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1863334399774798099"&gt; announced&lt;/a&gt; on X that he and Byers were ready to meet with entrepreneurs working on “artificial wombs,” “embryo editing,” and “next-gen IVF.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The post invited people to apply to attend an off-the-record dinner—a kind of forbidden-technologies soiree. Applicants had to fill in a Google form answering a few questions, including “What is something awesome you’ve built?”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Among those who attended the dinner was a postdoctoral fellow from Egli’s lab, Stepan Jerabek, who had led the base-editing research project.  Another attendee, Lucas Harrington, is a gene-editing scientist who trained at the University of California, Berkeley under&amp;nbsp;Jennifer Doudna, a winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry for development of CRISPR gene editing. Harrington says a venture group he helps run, called &lt;a href="https://www.scifounders.com/"&gt;SciFounders&lt;/a&gt;, is also considering starting an embryo-editing company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We share an interest in there being a company to empirically evaluate whether embryo editing can be done safely, and are actively exploring incubating a company to undertake this,” Harrington said in an email. “We believe there need to be legitimate scientists and clinicians working to safely evaluate this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of how rapidly gene editing is advancing, Harrington has also &lt;a href="https://lucas-harrington.com/2024/11/20/the-crispr-baby-ban-isnt-working-what-we-should-do-instead/"&gt;criticized bans&lt;/a&gt; and moratoria on the technology. These can’t stop it from being applied but, he says, can drive it into “the shadows,” where it might be used less safely. According to Harrington, “several biohacker groups have quietly raised small amounts of capital” to pursue the technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Armstrong’s public declaration on X represents a more transparent approach. “It seems pretty serious now. They want to put something together,” says Egli, who hopes the Coinbase CEO might fund some research at his lab. “I think it’s very good he posted publicly, because you can feel the temperature, see what reaction you get, and you stimulate the public conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first reports that researchers were &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/03/05/249167/engineering-the-perfect-baby/"&gt;testing CRISPR on human embryos&lt;/a&gt; in the lab emerged from China in 2015, causing shock waves as it became clear how easy, in theory, it was to change human heredity. Two years later, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/07/26/68093/first-human-embryos-edited-in-us/"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, a report from Oregon claimed successful correction of a dangerous DNA mutation present in lab embryos made from patients’ egg and sperm cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that breakthrough was not what it seemed. More careful testing by Egli and Oregon showed that CRISPR technology actually caused havoc in a cell, often deleting large chunks of chromosomes. That’s in addition to mosaicism, in which edits occur differently in different cells. What looked at first like precise DNA editing was in fact a dangerous process causing unseen damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the public debate turned on the ethics of CRISPR babies—especially after three edited children were born in China—researchers were discussing basic scientific problems and how to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then, both US labs, as well as some in China, have switched to base editing. That method, in theory, could also endow an embryo with a number of advantageous gene variants, not just one change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers also feel certain that editing an embryo is simpler than trying to treat sick adults. The only approved gene-editing treatment, for sickle-cell disease, costs more than $2 million. By contrast, editing an embryo could be incredibly cheap, and if it’s done early, when an embryo is forming, all the body cells could carry the change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You fix the text before you print the book,” says Egli. “It seems like a no-brainer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, gene editing isn’t quite ready for prime time in making babies. Getting there requires more work, including careful design of the editing system (which includes a protein and short guide molecule) and systematic ways to check embryos for unwanted DNA changes. That is the type of industrial effort Armstrong’s company, if he funds one, would be suited to carry out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You would have to optimize something to a point where it is perfect, to where it’s a breeze,” says Egli. “This is the kind of work that companies do.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brian Armstrong, the billionaire CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, says he’s ready to fund a US startup focused on gene-editing human embryos. If he goes forward, it would be the first major commercial investment in one of medicine’s most fraught ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1929340369457848561"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; on X June 2, Armstrong announced he was looking for gene-editing scientists and bioinformatics specialists to form a founding team for an “embryo editing” effort targeting an unmet medical need, such as a genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think the time is right for the defining company in the US to be built in this area,” Armstrong posted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The announcement from a deep-pocketed backer is a striking shift for a field considered taboo following the 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/25/138962/exclusive-chinese-scientists-are-creating-crispr-babies/"&gt;birth of the world’s first genetically edited children in China&lt;/a&gt;—a secretive experiment that led to international outrage and prison time for the lead scientist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Dieter Egli, a gene-editing scientist at Columbia University whose team has briefed Armstrong, his plans may be motivated in part by recent improvements in editing technology that have opened up a safer, more precise way to change the DNA of embryos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That technique, called base editing, can deftly change a single DNA letter. Earlier methods, on the other hand, actually cut the double helix, damaging it and causing whole genes to disappear. “We know much better now what to do,” says Egli. “It doesn’t mean the work is all done, but it’s a very different game now—entirely different.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoestring budget&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embryo editing, which ultimately aims to produce humans with genes tailored by design, is an idea that has been heavily stigmatized and starved of funding. While it&amp;#8217;s legal to study embryos in the lab, actually producing a gene-edited baby is flatly illegal in most countries.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, the CRISPR baby ban operates via a law that forbids the Food and Drug Administration from considering, or even acknowledging, any application it gets to attempt a gene-edited baby. But that rule could be changed, especially if scientists can demonstrate a compelling use of the technique—or perhaps if a billionaire lobbies for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his post, Armstrong included an image of a seven-year-old Pew Research Center poll showing Americans were strongly favorable to altering a baby’s genes if it could treat disease, although the same poll found most opposed experimentation on embryos.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, no US company has openly pursued embryo editing, and the federal government doesn’t fund studies on embryos at all. Instead, research on gene editing in embryos has been carried forward in the US by just two academic centers, Egli’s and one at the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Those efforts have operated on a shoestring, held together by private grants and university funds. Researchers at those centers said they support the idea of a well-financed company that could advance the technology. “We would honestly welcome that,” says Paula Amato, a fertility doctor at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University and the past president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“More research is needed, and that takes people and money,” she says, adding that she doesn’t mind if it comes from “tech bros.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Editing embryos can, in theory, be used to correct genetic errors likely to cause serious childhood conditions. But since in most cases genetic testing of embryos can also be used to avoid those errors, many argue it will be hard to find a true unmet need where the DNA-altering technique is actually necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, it&amp;#8217;s easy to conclude that the bigger market for the technology would be to intervene in embryos in ways that &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/22/1096458/crispr-gene-editing-babies-evolution/"&gt;could make humans resistant to common conditions,&lt;/a&gt; such as heart disease or Alzheimer’s. But that is more controversial because it’s a type of enhancement, and the changes would also be passed through the generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only last week, several biotech trade and academic groups demanded&lt;a href="https://alliancerm.org/press-release/moratorium-on-hhge/"&gt; a 10-year moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on heritable human genome editing, saying the technology has few real medical uses and “introduces long-term risks with unknown consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They said the ability to “program” desired traits or eliminate bad ones risked a new form of “eugenics,” one that would have the effect of “potentially altering the course of evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No limits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Armstrong did not reply to an email from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; seeking comment about his plans. Nor did his company Coinbase, a cryptocurrency trading platform that went public in 2021 and is the source of his fortune, estimated at $10 billion by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the US Department of Energy &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-wright-announces-termination-24-projects-generating-over-3-billion-taxpayer?utm_campaign=Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=364035686&amp;amp;utm_content=364035686&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was canceling $3.7 billion in funding for 24 projects related to energy and industry. That included nearly $1.3 billion for cement-related projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cement is a massive climate problem, accounting for roughly 7% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. What’s more, it’s a difficult industry to clean up, with huge traditional players and expensive equipment and infrastructure to replace. This funding was supposed to help address those difficulties, by supporting projects on the cusp of commercialization. Now companies will need to fill in the gap left by these cancellations, and it’s a big one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First up on the list for cuts is Sublime Systems, a company you’re probably familiar with if you’ve been reading this newsletter for a while. I did a &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/03/1084734/sublime-systems-cement-climate-change-carbon-footprint/?utm_source=the_spark&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_spark.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7Cdate:m-d-y%7C*" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;deep dive&lt;/a&gt; last year, and the company was on our list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in both &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080528/2023-climate-tech-companies-electric-vehicles-batteries-carbon-removal-energy-storage/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/01/1104432/2024-climate-tech-companies/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The startup’s approach is to make cement using electricity. The conventional process requires high temperatures typically achieved by burning fossil fuels, so avoiding that could prevent a lot of emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Sublime received an $87 million grant from the DOE to construct a commercial demonstration plant in Holyoke, Massachusetts. That grant would have covered roughly half the construction costs for the facility, which is scheduled to open in 2026 and produce up to 30,000 metric tons of cement each year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were certainly surprised and disappointed about the development,” says Joe Hicken, Sublime’s senior VP of business development and policy. Customers are excited by the company’s technology, Hicken adds, pointing to Sublime’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/microsoft-just-signed-a-deal-for-green-cement-here-s-why?sref=E9Urfma4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced deal with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which plans to buy up to 622,500 metric tons of cement from the company. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another big name, Brimstone, also saw its funding affected. That award totaled $189 million for a commercial demonstration plant, which was expected to produce over 100,000 metric tons of cement annually.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a Brimstone representative said the company believes the cancellation was a “misunderstanding.” The statement pointed out that the planned facility would make not only cement but also alumina, supporting US-based aluminum production. (Aluminum is classified as a &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;critical mineral&lt;/a&gt; by the US Geological Survey, meaning it’s considered crucial to the US economy and national security.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An award to Heidelberg Materials for up to $500 million for a planned Indiana facility was also axed. The idea there was to integrate carbon capture and storage to clean up emissions from the plant, which would have made it the first cement plant in the US to demonstrate that technology. In a written statement, a representative said the decision can be appealed, and the company is considering that option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And National Cement’s funding for the Lebec Net-Zero Project, another $500 million award, was canceled. That facility planned to make carbon-neutral cement through a combination of strategies: reducing the polluting ingredients needed, using alternative fuels like biomass, and capturing the plant’s remaining emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We want to emphasize that this project will expand domestic manufacturing capacity for a critical industrial sector, while also integrating new technologies to keep American cement competitive,” said a company spokesperson in a written statement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a sentiment here that’s echoed in all the responses I received: While these awards were designed to cut emissions, these companies argue that they can fit into the new administration’s priorities. They’re emphasizing phrases like “critical minerals,” “American jobs,” and “domestic supply chains.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve heard loud and clear from the Trump administration the desire to displace foreign imports of things that can be made here in America,” Sublime’s Hicken says. “At the end of the day, what we deliver is what the policymakers in DC are looking for.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But this administration is showing that it’s not supporting climate efforts—often even those that also advance its stated goals of energy abundance and American competitiveness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday, my colleague James Temple published &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/02/1117653/the-trump-administration-has-shut-down-more-than-100-climate-studies/?utm_source=the_spark&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_spark.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7Cdate:m-d-y%7C*" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new story&lt;/a&gt; about cuts to climate research, including tens of millions of dollars in grants from the National Science Foundation. Researchers at Harvard were particularly hard hit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even as there’s interest in advancing the position of the US on the world’s stage, these cuts are making it hard for researchers and companies alike to do the crucial work of understanding our climate and developing and deploying new technologies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Sublime received an $87 million grant from the DOE to construct a commercial demonstration plant in Holyoke, Massachusetts. That grant would have covered roughly half the construction costs for the facility, which is scheduled to open in 2026 and produce up to 30,000 metric tons of cement each year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were certainly surprised and disappointed about the development,” says Joe Hicken, Sublime’s senior VP of business development and policy. Customers are excited by the company’s technology, Hicken adds, pointing to Sublime’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/microsoft-just-signed-a-deal-for-green-cement-here-s-why?sref=E9Urfma4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced deal with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which plans to buy up to 622,500 metric tons of cement from the company. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another big name, Brimstone, also saw its funding affected. That award totaled $189 million for a commercial demonstration plant, which was expected to produce over 100,000 metric tons of cement annually.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a Brimstone representative said the company believes the cancellation was a “misunderstanding.” The statement pointed out that the planned facility would make not only cement but also alumina, supporting US-based aluminum production. (Aluminum is classified as a &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;critical mineral&lt;/a&gt; by the US Geological Survey, meaning it’s considered crucial to the US economy and national security.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An award to Heidelberg Materials for up to $500 million for a planned Indiana facility was also axed. The idea there was to integrate carbon capture and storage to clean up emissions from the plant, which would have made it the first cement plant in the US to demonstrate that technology. In a written statement, a representative said the decision can be appealed, and the company is considering that option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And National Cement’s funding for the Lebec Net-Zero Project, another $500 million award, was canceled. That facility planned to make carbon-neutral cement through a combination of strategies: reducing the polluting ingredients needed, using alternative fuels like biomass, and capturing the plant’s remaining emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We want to emphasize that this project will expand domestic manufacturing capacity for a critical industrial sector, while also integrating new technologies to keep American cement competitive,” said a company spokesperson in a written statement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a sentiment here that’s echoed in all the responses I received: While these awards were designed to cut emissions, these companies argue that they can fit into the new administration’s priorities. They’re emphasizing phrases like “critical minerals,” “American jobs,” and “domestic supply chains.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve heard loud and clear from the Trump administration the desire to displace foreign imports of things that can be made here in America,” Sublime’s Hicken says. “At the end of the day, what we deliver is what the policymakers in DC are looking for.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But this administration is showing that it’s not supporting climate efforts—often even those that also advance its stated goals of energy abundance and American competitiveness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday, my colleague James Temple published &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/02/1117653/the-trump-administration-has-shut-down-more-than-100-climate-studies/?utm_source=the_spark&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_spark.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7Cdate:m-d-y%7C*" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new story&lt;/a&gt; about cuts to climate research, including tens of millions of dollars in grants from the National Science Foundation. Researchers at Harvard were particularly hard hit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even as there’s interest in advancing the position of the US on the world’s stage, these cuts are making it hard for researchers and companies alike to do the crucial work of understanding our climate and developing and deploying new technologies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crypto billionaire Brian Armstrong is ready to invest in CRISPR baby tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian Armstrong, the billionaire CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, says he’s ready to fund a US startup focused on gene-editing human embryos. If he goes forward, it would be the first major commercial investment in one of medicine’s most fraught ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a post on X June 2, Armstrong announced he was looking for gene-editing scientists and bioinformatics specialists to form a founding team for an “embryo editing” effort targeting an unmet medical need, such as a genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The announcement from a deep-pocketed backer is a striking shift for a field considered taboo following the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/25/138962/exclusive-chinese-scientists-are-creating-crispr-babies/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;2018 birth of the world’s first genetically edited children in China&lt;/a&gt;—a secretive experiment that led to international outrage and prison time for the lead scientist. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/05/1117909/crypto-billionaire-brian-armstrong-is-ready-to-invest-in-crispr-baby-tech/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over $1 billion in federal funding got slashed for this polluting industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clean cement industry might be facing the end of the road, before it ever really got rolling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, the US Department of Energy announced that it was canceling $3.7 billion in funding for 24 projects related to energy and industry. That included nearly $1.3 billion for cement-related projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cement is a massive climate problem, accounting for roughly 7% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. What’s more, it’s a difficult industry to clean up, with huge traditional players and expensive equipment and infrastructure to replace. This funding was supposed to help address those difficulties, by supporting projects on the cusp of commercialization. Now companies will need to fill in the gap left by these cancellations, and it’s a big one. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/05/1117855/cement-funding-slash/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe you will be able to live past 122&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long can humans live? This is a good time to ask the question. The longevity scene is having a moment, and research suggests that we might be able to push human life spans further, potentially even reversing some signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Researchers can’t even agree on what the exact mechanisms of aging are and which they should be targeting. Debates continue to rage over how long it’s possible for humans to live—and whether there is a limit at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it looks likely that something will be developed in the coming decades that will help us live longer, in better health. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/26/1096126/aging-health-longevity-lifespan-advances-investment/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement from a deep-pocketed backer is a striking shift for a field considered taboo following the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/25/138962/exclusive-chinese-scientists-are-creating-crispr-babies/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;2018 birth of the world’s first genetically edited children in China&lt;/a&gt;—a secretive experiment that led to international outrage and prison time for the lead scientist. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/05/1117909/crypto-billionaire-brian-armstrong-is-ready-to-invest-in-crispr-baby-tech/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over $1 billion in federal funding got slashed for this polluting industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clean cement industry might be facing the end of the road, before it ever really got rolling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, the US Department of Energy announced that it was canceling $3.7 billion in funding for 24 projects related to energy and industry. That included nearly $1.3 billion for cement-related projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cement is a massive climate problem, accounting for roughly 7% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. What’s more, it’s a difficult industry to clean up, with huge traditional players and expensive equipment and infrastructure to replace. This funding was supposed to help address those difficulties, by supporting projects on the cusp of commercialization. Now companies will need to fill in the gap left by these cancellations, and it’s a big one. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/05/1117855/cement-funding-slash/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Reddit is suing Anthropic &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reddit claims the AI company kept accessing its site after claiming it had stopped.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 A lawsuit accuses DOGE of exploiting “error-riden” data to fire workers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It claims the department knew its records were inaccurate, but used them to fire 10,000 employees anyway.(&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/lawsuit-doge-hhs-used-hopelessly-error-ridden-data-to-fire-10000-workers/"&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;+ &lt;em&gt;Unlike Elon Musk, Russ Vought knows the federal government inside out. &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/vought-asks-congress-to-rubber-stamp-doge-cuts.html"&gt;NY Mag&lt;/a&gt; $)&lt;br /&gt;+ &lt;em&gt;The first wave of DOGE staffers are becoming full-time government workers. &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-balls-young-doge-converted-into-full-time-government-employees/"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; $)&lt;br /&gt;+ &lt;em&gt;DOGE’s tech takeover threatens the safety and stability of our critical data. &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/14/1114988/doges-tech-takeover-threatens-the-safety-and-stability-of-our-critical-data/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quote of the day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-large-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Anthropic bills itself as the white knight of the AI industry. It is anything but.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;—Reddit takes aim at Anthropic in a legal filing against the AI company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/679768/reddit-sues-anthropic-alleging-its-bots-accessed-reddit-more-than-100000-times-since-last-july"&gt;the Verge&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/26/1096126/aging-health-longevity-lifespan-advances-investment/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*|SUBCLASS|*&amp;amp;utm_content=*|DATE:m-d-Y|*"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/240814_longevity_essay.jpg?fit=1616,908" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe you will be able to live past 122&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long can humans live? This is a good time to ask the question. The longevity scene is having a moment, and research suggests that we might be able to push human life spans further, potentially even reversing some signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Researchers can’t even agree on what the exact mechanisms of aging are and which they should be targeting. Debates continue to rage over how long it’s possible for humans to live—and whether there is a limit at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it looks likely that something will be developed in the coming decades that will help us live longer, in better health. &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/26/1096126/aging-health-longevity-lifespan-advances-investment/?utm_source=the_download&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*"&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who uses Reddit, even a web-crawling bot, agrees to the site&amp;#8217;s user agreement. That agreement is clear: you cannot just take content from the site and use it for your own commercial products without a written deal. Reddit claims Anthropic&amp;#8217;s bots have been doing exactly that for years, scraping massive amounts of conversations and posts to train and improve Claude.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes this lawsuit particularly spicy is the way it goes after Anthropic&amp;#8217;s reputation. Anthropic has worked hard to brand itself as the ethical, trustworthy AI company, the &amp;#8220;white knight&amp;#8221; of the industry. The lawsuit, however, calls these claims nothing more than &amp;#8220;empty marketing gimmicks&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, Reddit points to a statement from July 2024 where Anthropic claimed it had stopped its bots from crawling Reddit. The lawsuit says this was &amp;#8220;false&amp;#8221;, alleging that its logs caught Anthropic&amp;#8217;s bots trying to access the site more than one hundred thousand times in the following months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this isn&amp;#8217;t just about corporate squabbles; it directly involves user privacy. When you delete a post or a comment on Reddit, you expect it to be gone. Reddit has official licensing deals with other big AI players like Google &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-secures-key-partnership-with-reddit/"&gt;and OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;, and these deals include technical measures to ensure that when a user deletes content, the AI company does too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Reddit&amp;#8217;s lawsuit, Anthropic has no such deal and has refused to enter one. This means if their AI was trained on a post you later deleted, that content could still be baked into Claude&amp;#8217;s knowledge base, effectively ignoring your choice to remove it. The lawsuit even includes a screenshot where Claude itself admits it has no real way of knowing if the Reddit data it was trained on was later deleted by a user:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot from a court filing in the lawsuit of Anthropic Claude admitting it does not know if scraped Reddit data was later deleted." class="wp-image-106716" height="858" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/anthropic-reddit-data-claude-ai-deleted-data-artificial-intelligence-1024x858.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what does Reddit want? It&amp;#8217;s not just about money, although they are asking for damages for things like increased server costs and lost licensing fees. They are asking the court for an injunction to force Anthropic to stop using any Reddit data immediately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Reddit wants to prohibit Anthropic from selling or licensing any product that was built using that data. That means they&amp;#8217;re asking a judge to effectively take Claude off the market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This case forces a tough question: Does being &amp;#8220;publicly available&amp;#8221; on the internet mean content is free for any corporation &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/tony-blair-institute-ai-copyright-report-sparks-backlash/"&gt;to take and monetise?&lt;/a&gt; Reddit is arguing a firm &amp;#8220;no,&amp;#8221; and the outcome could change the rules for how AI is developed from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what does Reddit want? It&amp;#8217;s not just about money, although they are asking for damages for things like increased server costs and lost licensing fees. They are asking the court for an injunction to force Anthropic to stop using any Reddit data immediately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Reddit wants to prohibit Anthropic from selling or licensing any product that was built using that data. That means they&amp;#8217;re asking a judge to effectively take Claude off the market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This case forces a tough question: Does being &amp;#8220;publicly available&amp;#8221; on the internet mean content is free for any corporation &lt;a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/tony-blair-institute-ai-copyright-report-sparks-backlash/"&gt;to take and monetise?&lt;/a&gt; Reddit is arguing a firm &amp;#8220;no,&amp;#8221; and the outcome could change the rules for how AI is developed from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;
