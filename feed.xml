Abstract: Speculative decoding relies on fast and accurate drafters. Recent state-of-the-art language models employ larger and larger vocabularies, which significantly slows down drafters. One promising approach to boost the efficiency of speculative decoding is to use drafters with smaller vocabularies. However, existing sampling methods cannot draw out-of-vocabulary tokens, creating a tradeoff between drafters' vocabulary size and acceptance rates.

Abstract: Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in time series forecasting.

Abstract: The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; b...</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Causal Discovery in Dynamic Fading Wireless Networks (cs.LG updates on arXiv.org)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03163</link><description>arXiv:2506.03163v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Classifier free guidance has shown strong potential in diffusion-based reinforcement learning. However, existing methods rely on joint training of the guidance module and the diffusion model, which can be suboptimal during the early stages when the guidance is inaccurate and provides noisy learning signals.

Despite the promise of feedback-driven improvement, the stability of agentic workflows rests on the reliability of the judge. However, judges may hallucinate information, exhibit bias, or act adversarially -- introducing critical vulnerabilities into the ...</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03332</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Axiomatics of Restricted Choices by Linear Orders of Sets with Minimum as Fallback (cs.AI updates on arXiv.org)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03315</link><description>arXiv:2506.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how linear orders can be employed to realise choice functions for which the set of potential choices is restricted, i.e., the possible choice is not possible among the full powerset of all alternatives. In such restricted settings, constructing a choice function via a relation on the alternatives is not always possible. However, we show that one can always construct a choice function via a linear order on sets of alternatives, even when a...</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03315</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A Trustworthiness-based Metaphysics of Artificial Intelligence Systems (cs.AI updates on arXiv.org)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03233</link><description>arXiv:2506.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to support our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions -- their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge thi...</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03233</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Q-ARDNS-Multi: A Multi-Agent Quantum Reinforcement Learning Framework with Meta-Cognitive Adaptation for Complex 3D Environments (cs.AI updates on arXiv.org)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03205</link><description>arXiv:2506.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Q-ARDNS-Multi, an advanced multi-agent quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) framework that extends the ARDNS-FN-Quantum model, where Q-ARDNS-Multi stands for "Quantum Adaptive Reward-Driven Neural Simulator - Multi-Agent". It integrates quantum circuits with RY gates, meta-cognitive adaptation, and multi-agent coordination mechanisms for complex 3D environments. Q-ARDNS-Multi leverages a 2-qubit quantum circuit for action selec...</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03205</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai dismisses AI job fears, emphasizes expansion plans (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/04/alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-dismisses-ai-job-fears-emphasizes-expansion-plans/</link><description>In a Bloomberg interview Wednesday night in downtown San Francisco, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually make half the company&amp;#8217;s 180,000-person workforce redundant.
