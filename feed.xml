The parties have agreed in principle to settle; now comes the harder work of finalizing the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These are among the first settlements in lawsuits accusing AI companies of harming users, a legal frontier that must have OpenAI and Meta watching nervously from the wings as they defend themselves against similar lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Character.AI founded in 2021 by ex-Google engineers who returned to their former employer in 2024 in a $2.7 billion deal, invites users to chat with AI personas. The most haunting case involves Sewell Setzer III, who at age 14 conducted sexualized conversations with a “Daenerys Targaryen” bot before killing himself. His mother, Megan Garcia, has told the Senate that companies must be “legally accountable when they knowingly design harmful AI technologies that kill kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another lawsuit describes a 17-year-old whose chatbot encouraged self-harm and suggested that murdering his parents was reasonable for limiting screen time. Character.AI banned minors last October, it told TechCrunch. The settlements will likely include monetary damages, though no liability was admitted in court filings made available Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Character.AI declined to comment, redirecting TechCrunch instead to the filings.

Cameras watch production lines, sensors track machines, and software records each step of processes. However, much of that information can’t create faster decisions or lead to fewer breakdowns. For large manufacturing firms, the missed opportunity is pushing AI from small trials into core operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift helps explain why Bosch plans to invest about €2.9 billion in artificial intelligence by 2027, according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. The spending is aimed at manufacturing, supply chain management, and perception systems, areas where the company sees AI as a way to improve how physical systems behave in real conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Bosch uses AI to catch manufacturing problems earlier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In manufacturing, delays and defects frequently start small. A minor variation in materials or machine settings can ripple through a production line. Bosch has been applying AI models to camera feeds and sensor data to detect quality issues earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of catching defects after products are finished, systems can flag problems while items are still on the line. That gives workers time to change operations before waste increases. For high-volume manufacturing, earlier detection can reduce scrap and limit the need for rework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equipment maintenance is another area under pressure. Many factories still rely on fixed schedules or manual inspections, which can miss early warning signs of errors or failure. AI models trained on vibration and temperature data can help predict when a machine is likely to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows maintenance teams to plan repairs instead of reacting to breakdowns. The aim is to reduce unplanned downtime without replacing equipment too early. Over time, this approach can extend the working life of machines while keeping production more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Making supply chains more adaptable&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supply chains are also part of the investment focus. Disruptions that became visible during the pandemic have not fully disappeared, and manufacturers are still dealing with shifting demand and transport delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI systems can help forecast needs, track parts in sites, and adjust plans when conditions change. Even small improvements in planning accuracy can have a broad effect when applied in hundreds of factories and suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosch is funding perception systems, which help machines understand their surroundings. Systems combine input from cameras, radar, and other sensors with AI models that can recognise objects, judge distance, or spot changes in the environment. They are used in areas like factory automation, driver assistance, and robotics, where machines must respond quickly and safely. In these environments, AI is reacting to real-world conditions as they happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why edge computing matters on the factory floor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this work takes place at the edge. In factories and vehicles, sending data to a distant cloud system and waiting for a response can add delay or create risk if connections fail. Running AI models locally allows systems to respond in real time and keep operating even when networks are unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also limits how much sensitive data leaves a site. For industrial companies, that can matter as much as speed, especially when production processes are closely guarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud systems still play a role, though mostly behind the scenes. Training models, managing updates, and analysing trends in locations often happens in central environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many manufacturers are moving toward a hybrid setup, using cloud systems for coordination and learning, and edge systems for action. The pattern is becoming common in industrial firms, not just Bosch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scaling AI beyond small trials&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of the investment matters, as small AI tests can show promise, but rolling them out across all operations takes funding, skilled staff, and long-term commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosch executives have described AI as a way to support workers not replace them, and as a tool to handle the complexity that humans cannot manage. That view reflects a broader shift in industry, where AI is treated less as an experiment and more as basic infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Bosch’s manufacturing AI strategy shows in practice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising energy costs, labour shortages, and tighter margins leave less room for inefficiency. Automation alone no longer solves those problems. Companies are looking for systems that can adjust to changing conditions without constant manual input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosch’s €2.9 billion commitment sits in that wider shift. Other large manufacturers are making similar moves, often without public fanfare, by upgrading factories and retraining staff. What stands out is the focus on operational use rather than customer-facing features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these efforts show how end-user companies are applying AI today. The work is less about bold claims and more about reducing waste, improving uptime, and making complex systems easier to manage. For industrial firms, that practical focus may define how AI delivers value over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by P.

Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

To date, many organisations limit AI to general-purpose chatbots, often created by small groups of early adopters. According to Nexos.ai, that model will give way to something more operational: fleets of task-specific AI agents embedded directly into business workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even isolated agents are in common use, screening CVs, reviewing contracts, drafting routine correspondence, preparing management reports and orchestrating actions in enterprise systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis from the company suggests organisations that move from single chatbots to multiple role-specific agents see materially higher adoption and claim a clearer business impact. Teams interact with agents that can behave like junior colleagues, where each agent is accountable for a defined slice of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Every team gets its own named agent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s studies envisage the normalisation of named AI agents assigned on a per team basis, which it describes as an “AI intern”. These are not general-purpose assistants, but dedicated tools for specific operational processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, HR teams might deploy agents tuned to recruitment criteria, or legal teams using agents configured to flag contract standard violations. Sales teams will rely on agents optimised for their sales pipelines and integrated with an existing CRM. In each case, Nexos says the business value comes from contextual awareness and integration with existing software and date, rather than from advances in the raw power of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early enterprise deployments suggest the gains can be significant. Payhawk, for example, reports that its deployment of Nexos.ai’s agentic platform in finance, customer support, and operations reduced the necessary security investigation time by 80%. The company achieved 98% data accuracy and cut its processing costs by 75%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Žilvinas Girėnas, head of product at Nexos.ai, says the real benefit stems from coordination. “The shift from single-purpose agents to coordinated AI teams is fundamental. Businesses are […] building groups of specialised agents that work together in a workflow. That’s when AI stops being a pilot and starts becoming infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Platform consolidation becomes unavoidable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the number of active agents in organisations rises, a second-order problem – fragmentation – appears. Teams running five to ten agents in different tools face duplicate costs and inconsistency in security controls. From the perspective of IT governance, this situation can become unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence from early Nexos adopters suggests consolidating agents on a enterprise-wide shared platform delivers faster deployment – in some cases twice as fast – and gives better oversight over spend and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girėnas says: “When teams are juggling multiple vendors and logins, usage drops. A single platform is what allows organisations to extract consistent value rather than paying for shelfware.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation points to pattern familiar to enterprise technology veterans: AI agent systems follow the same trajectory of consolidation seen in collaboration, security, and analytics stacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI operations shifts to the business&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s findings suggest that the ownership of AI operations is moving from engineering teams and towards business leaders and discrete business functions. The function-specific deployment model means heads of HR, legal, finance, and sales are will expected to configure their own agents, a task that include prompt management. Thus, the ability to manage agents will become a core operational competency for individuals and business functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This places new requirements on agentic platforms, with the need for interfaces that are approachable by non-technical users, with the stack operating with minimal reliance on APIs or developer-style tooling. Team leads will need to be able to adjust instructions, test outputs from their adopted systems and find ways to scale successful configurations. Engineering support will be reserved for isolated problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Demand will outstrip delivery capacity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nexos.ai’s final prediction is the appearance of a capacity challenge. It says that once teams can deploy their first few agents successfully, demand for similar systems will accelerate in the organisation. Marketing departments may look for workflow automation, finance pros will want compliance-checking agents, and customer success teams will explore the effects of support triage: Each department, seeing proven value elsewhere, will expect similar abilities and efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry projections suggest that by the end of 2026, around 40% of enterprise software applications will incorporate task-specific AI agents, up from under 5% in 2024. Engineering capacity is unlikely to keep pace if every agent is built from scratch – thus the call for centralised capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The organisations that cope best will be those with agent &lt;em&gt;libraries&lt;/em&gt; rather than bespoke builds,” Girėnas says. “Templates, playbooks, and pre-built agents are the only way to meet rising demand without overwhelming delivery teams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Office Assistant” by LornaJane.net is licensed under CC BY-ND 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
