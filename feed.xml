Now, with his new, New York-based venture Audos, he’s betting that AI can help him scale that process from “tens” of startups a year to “hundreds of thousands” of aspiring business owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The timing certainly feels right. Mass layoffs across a variety of industries have left many workers reconsidering their career paths, while AI tools have markedly lowered the barrier to building digital products and services. At the center of that Venn diagram is Werdelin’s latest venture, with its promise to help “everyday entrepreneurs create million dollar AI companies” without requiring technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Werdelin’s journey from Prehype to Audos reflects the broader transformation happening in entrepreneurship right now. At Prehype, the focus was on working with tech founders to build traditional startups, the kind that might raise millions and aim for billion-dollar exits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, he tells TechCrunch, “What we’re trying to do is take all that knowledge, all the methodology that we’ve created over the years of building all these big companies, and really trying to democratize it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The idea is that “everyday entrepreneurs” may sense a shift is afoot but may not be keen to experiment with so-called AI agents or know how to reach customers. Audos is more than happy to help them, supplying these individuals with AI tools to build sophisticated products using natural language, and taking advantage of social media algorithms to find them their niche customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Facebook and a lot of these platforms, they are just incredible algorithms, and they’re incredible at figuring out [how to reach your customer] if you define a customer group,” says Werdelin, who co-founded Audos with his Prehype partner Nicholas Thorne. In fact, Audos uses this system to quickly test whether a founder’s business idea has sustainable customer acquisition costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The approach seems to be working. Audos has helped launch “low hundreds” of businesses since its beta launch, with its own customers discovering the platform through Instagram ads asking “Have you ever thought about starting something, but don’t know where to go?” Among them, Werdelin says, are a car mechanic who wants to help people evaluate repair quotes, an individual who is selling “after death logistics” services, virtual golf swing coaches, and AI nutritionists.&amp;nbsp;In a winking reference to billion-dollar businesses, or so-called unicorns, he calls these one- and two-person teams “donkeycorns.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3022679" height="490" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-26-at-6.47.58PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All went through the same process: they clicked on Audos’s ad, its AI agent launched a conversation to figure out the problems these individuals want to tackle and who they want to serve, and, when it was satisfied with the answers, Audos got them in front of potential customers as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for returns, Audos operates on a fundamentally different model than traditional accelerators or venture capital. Instead of taking equity, the company takes a 15% revenue share from the businesses it helps launch. In return, founders get up to $25,000 in funding, access to those AI-powered business development tools, and help with distribution (again, primarily through paid social media advertising).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re not taking any equity in their business,” Werdelin says. There isn’t much point. “We don’t think these companies might ever get sold,” he says. “What we’re really inspired by are the mom-and-pop shops that are the backbone of our society.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The revenue share continues indefinitely, similar to platform fees charged by Apple’s App Store. For founders, that means giving up a significant portion of their revenue in perpetuity — a 15% cut that could cost entrepreneurs hundreds of thousands of dollars over time. Some will undoubtedly see that trade-off as worthwhile; others might question whether the long-term costs justify the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Audos’s value proposition raises other questions, too, given how quickly the landscape is changing. While Werdelin emphasizes helping founders build relationships with customers, it’s unclear how much of that work the AI agents can actually handle. There’s also the matter of differentiation. As Werdelin readily acknowledges, “the world is full of these tools” and they’re getting better rapidly. What happens when entrepreneurs can access similar AI capabilities without paying a permanent revenue tax?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Audos’s VCs don’t sound worried about those scenarios. True Ventures led Audos’s $11.5 million seed round, with partner Tony Conrad explaining the appeal in a Zoom call this week. In addition to having confidence in Werdelin and Thorne, says Conrad, “I think there are just lots and lots of people” who might eagerly embrace the opportunity to work with a platform like Audos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Conrad draws parallels to Instagram’s $1 billion exit with just 13 employees, suggesting that AI could enable even more leverage, even if Audos — which itself employs just five people altogether currently —&amp;nbsp; isn’t chasing unicorns. As Werdelin explains it, “What we’re after here is the millions of people who can create million-dollar businesses or half-million dollar businesses that are real and life changing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adds Werdelin separately of why he spun up Audos, “What we’re trying to do is to figure out how you make a million companies that do a million dollars [in annual revenue]. That’s a trillion dollar turnover business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Midway through 2025, it doesn’t sound crazy. Extending the benefits of entrepreneurship to people who traditionally haven’t had access to startup capital or technical skills is an increasingly compelling proposition as traditional employment begins to feel less and less stable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We believe that there should be somebody who goes out and really helps these smaller entrepreneurs that are building something that is not venture backable,” says Werdelin. “We believe that the world is better with more entrepreneurship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Audos’s other investors include Offline Venture and Bungalow Capital, along with numerous high-profile angel investors – Niklas Zennstrom and Mario Schlosser among them.&lt;/p&gt;

Such small-scale energy systems can operate on or off the larger electricity grid, providing electricity for businesses or communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood Materials says many of the batteries it takes in for processing retain more than half their capacity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We can extract a lot more value from that material by using it as an energy storage project before recycling it,” JB Straubel, Redwood’s founder and chief executive, said at the event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This first microgrid, housed at the company’s facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, is powered by solar panels and capable of generating 64 megawatt-hours of electricity, making it one of the nation’s largest such systems. That power flows to Crusoe, a cryptocurrency miner that pivoted into developing AI data centers, which has built a facility with 2,000 graphics processing units adjacent to the lot of repurposed EV batteries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;(That’s tiny as modern data centers go: Crusoe is developing a $500 billion AI data center for OpenAI and others in Abilene, Texas, where it expects to install 100,000 GPUs across its first two facilities by the end of the year, according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood’s project underscores a growing interest in powering data centers partially or entirely outside the electric grid. Not only would such microgrids be quicker to build than conventional power plants, but consumer ratepayers wouldn’t be on the hook for the cost of new grid-connected power plants developed to serve AI data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Redwood's batteries are used, and have already been removed from vehicles, the company says its microgrids should also be substantially cheaper than ones assembled from new batteries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A close up of grid of battery packs from Redwood Materials." class="wp-image-1119406" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250626_batterypacks_embed.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY REDWOOD MATERIALS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Redwood Energy’s microgrids could generate electricity for any kind of operation. But the company stresses they’re an ideal fit for addressing the growing energy needs and climate emissions of data centers. The energy consumption of such facilities could double by 2030, mainly due to the ravenous appetite of AI, according to an April report by the International Energy Agency.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Storage is this perfectly positioned technology, especially low-cost storage, to attack each of those problems,” Straubel says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is the epicenter of a data center development boom in northern Nevada that has sparked growing concerns about climate emissions and excessive demand for energy and water, as &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; recently reported.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Straubel says the litany of data centers emerging around it "would be logical targets" for its new business line, but adds there are growth opportunities across the expanding data center clusters in Texas, Virginia and the Midwest as well. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;"We're talking to a broad cross section of those companies," he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Crusoe, which also provides cloud services, recently announced a joint venture with the investment firm Engine No. 1 to provide “powered data center real estate solutions” to AI companies by constructing 4.5 gigawatts of new natural-gas plants.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Redwood's microgrid should provide more than 99% of the electricity Crusoe’s local facilities need. In the event of extended periods with little sunlight, a rarity in the Nevada desert, the company could still draw from the standard power grid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cully Cavness, cofounder and operating chief of Crusoe, says the company is already processing AI queries and producing conclusions for its customers at the Nevada facility. (Its larger data centers are dedicated to the more computationally intensive process of training AI models.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood’s new business division offers a test case for a strategy laid out in a paper late last year, which highlighted the potential for solar-powered microgrids to supply the energy that AI data centers need.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The authors of that paper found that microgrids could be built much faster than natural-gas plants and would generally be only a little more expensive as an energy source for data centers, so long as the facilities could occasionally rely on natural-gas generators to get them through extended periods of low sunlight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If solar-powered microgrids were used to power 30 gigawatts of new AI data centers, with just 10% backup from natural gas, it would eliminate 400 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions relative to running the centers entirely on natural gas, the study found.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Having a data center running off solar and storage is more or less what we were advocating for in our paper,” says Zeke Hausfather, climate lead at the payments company Stripe and a coauthor of the paper. He hopes that Redwood's new microgrid will establish that “these sorts of systems work in the real world” and encourage other data center developers to look for similar solutions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood Materials says electric vehicles are its fastest-growing source of used batteries, and it estimates that more than 100,000 EVs will come off US roads this year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company says it tests each battery to determine whether it can be reused. Those that qualify will be integrated into its modular storage systems, which can then store up energy from wind and solar installations or connect to the grid. As those batteries reach the end of their life, they’ll be swapped out of the microgrids and moved into the company’s recycling process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Redwood says it already has enough reusable batteries to build a gigawatt-hour’s worth of microgrids, capable of powering a little more than a million homes for an hour. In addition, the company’s new division has begun designing microgrids that are 10 times larger than the one it unveiled this week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Straubel expects Redwood Energy to become a major business line, conceivably surpassing the company’s core recycling operation someday.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re confident this is the lowest-cost solution out there,” he says.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a sandy industrial lot outside Reno, Nevada, rows of battery packs that once propelled electric vehicles are now powering a small AI data center.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood Materials, one of the US’s largest battery recycling companies, showed off this array of energy storage modules, sitting on cinder blocks and wrapped in waterproof plastic, during a press tour at its headquarters on June 26.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The event marked the launch of the company's new business line, Redwood Energy, which will initially repurpose (rather than recycle) batteries with years of remaining life to create renewable-powered microgrids.

(Its larger data centers are dedicated to the more computationally intensive process of training AI models.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood’s new business division offers a test case for a strategy laid out in a paper late last year, which highlighted the potential for solar-powered microgrids to supply the energy that AI data centers need.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The authors of that paper found that microgrids could be built much faster than natural-gas plants and would generally be only a little more expensive as an energy source for data centers, so long as the facilities could occasionally rely on natural-gas generators to get them through extended periods of low sunlight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If solar-powered microgrids were used to power 30 gigawatts of new AI data centers, with just 10% backup from natural gas, it would eliminate 400 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions relative to running the centers entirely on natural gas, the study found.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Having a data center running off solar and storage is more or less what we were advocating for in our paper,” says Zeke Hausfather, climate lead at the payments company Stripe and a coauthor of the paper. He hopes that Redwood's new microgrid will establish that “these sorts of systems work in the real world” and encourage other data center developers to look for similar solutions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood Materials says electric vehicles are its fastest-growing source of used batteries, and it estimates that more than 100,000 EVs will come off US roads this year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company says it tests each battery to determine whether it can be reused. Those that qualify will be integrated into its modular storage systems, which can then store up energy from wind and solar installations or connect to the grid. As those batteries reach the end of their life, they’ll be swapped out of the microgrids and moved into the company’s recycling process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Redwood says it already has enough reusable batteries to build a gigawatt-hour’s worth of microgrids, capable of powering a little more than a million homes for an hour. In addition, the company’s new division has begun designing microgrids that are 10 times larger than the one it unveiled this week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Straubel expects Redwood Energy to become a major business line, conceivably surpassing the company’s core recycling operation someday.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re confident this is the lowest-cost solution out there,” he says.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/26/1119402/this-battery-recycling-company-is-now-cleaning-up-ai-data-centers/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] We’re learning more about what weight-loss drugs do to the body (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/27/1119385/were-learning-more-about-what-weight-loss-drugs-do-to-the-body/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250625-checkup-weightloss.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weight-loss drugs are this decade’s blockbuster medicines. Drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro help people with diabetes get their blood sugar under control and help overweight and obese people reach a healthier weight. And they’re fast becoming a trendy must-have for celebrities and other figure-conscious individuals looking to trim down.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They became so hugely popular so quickly that not long after their approval for weight loss, we saw global shortages of the drugs.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Prescriptions have soared over the last five years, but even people who don’t have prescriptions are seeking these drugs out online. A&amp;nbsp;2024 health tracking poll by KFF found that around 1 in 8 US adults said they had taken one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;We know they can suppress appetite, lower blood sugar, and lead to dramatic weight loss. We also know that they come with side effects, which can include nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. But we are still learning about some of their other effects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, these seemingly miraculous drugs appear to improve health in other ways, helping to protect against heart failure, kidney disease, and potentially even substance-use disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But on the other, they appear to be harmful to some people. Their use has been linked to serious conditions, pregnancy complications, and&amp;nbsp;even some deaths. This week let’s take a look at what weight-loss drugs can do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ozempic, Wegovy, and other similar drugs are known as GLP-1 agonists; they mimic a chemical made in the intestine, GLP-1, that increases insulin and lowers blood levels of glucose. Originally developed to treat diabetes, they are now known to be phenomenal at suppressing appetite. One&amp;nbsp;key trial, published in 2015, found that over the course of around a year, people who took one particular drug lost between around 4.7% and 6% of their body weight, depending on the dose they took.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newer versions of that drug were shown to have even bigger effects. &lt;/strong&gt;A 2021 trial of semaglutide—the active ingredient in both Ozempic and Wegovy—found that&amp;nbsp;people who took it for 68 weeks lost around 15% of their body weight—equivalent to around 15 kilograms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there appear to be other benefits, too. In 2024,&amp;nbsp;an enormous study that included 17,604 people in 41 countries found that semaglutide appeared to reduce heart failure in people who were overweight or obese and had cardiovascular disease. That same year,&amp;nbsp;the US approved Wegovy to “reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, and stroke in [overweight] adults with cardiovascular disease.” This year, Ozempic was approved to reduce the risk of kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it doesn’t end there. &lt;/strong&gt;The many users of GLP-1 agonists have been reporting some unexpected positive side effects. Not only are they less interested in food, but they are less interested in alcohol, tobacco,&amp;nbsp;opioids, and other addictive substances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more we learn about GLP-1 agonists, the more miraculous they seem to be. &lt;/strong&gt;What &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; they do?! you might wonder. Unfortunately, like any drug, GLP-1 agonists carry safety warnings. They can often cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea ,and their use has also been linked to inflammation of the pancreas—a condition that can be fatal. They&amp;nbsp;increase the risk of gall bladder disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are other concerns. Weight-loss drugs can help people trim down on fat, but lean muscle&amp;nbsp;can make up around 10% of the body weight lost by people taking them. That muscle is important, especially as we get older. Muscle loss can affect strength and mobility, and it also can also leave people more vulnerable to falls, which&amp;nbsp;are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And, as with most drugs, we don’t fully understand the effects weight-loss drugs might have in pregnancy. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s important; even though the drugs are not recommended during pregnancy, health agencies point out that&amp;nbsp;some people who take these drugs might be more likely to get pregnant, perhaps because they interfere with the effects of contraceptive drugs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And we don’t really know how they might affect the development of a fetus, if at all. A study published in January found that people who took the drugs either before or during pregnancy&amp;nbsp;didn’t seem to face increased risk of birth defects. But other research due to be presented at a conference in the coming days found that such individuals were&amp;nbsp;more likely to experience obstetrical complications and preeclampsia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So yes, while the drugs are incredibly helpful for many people, they are not for everyone. It might be fashionable to be thin, but it’s not necessarily healthy. No drug comes without risks.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meike Kamp, Berlin’s Commissioner for data protection and freedom of information, told the companies that DeepSeek did not provide “convincing evidence” that users’ data was protected as required by EU laws.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Chinese authorities have far-reaching access rights to personal data within the sphere of influence of Chinese companies,” Kamp said, adding that the two tech firms must now review the report and decide whether to remove the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kamp said that her office had asked DeepSeek to comply with EU laws for transferring data outside the bloc or pull its app from the country, but the Chinese company did not do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Italy earlier this year banned DeepSeek from app stores in the country, citing similar data protection concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, two key details about DeepSeek that consumer privacy advocate groups in the EU highlighted are that the service is made in and operates out of China. Per its privacy policy, this includes the information and data that DeepSeek collects and stores, which is also housed in its home country.&lt;/p&gt;
