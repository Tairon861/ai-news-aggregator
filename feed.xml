&lt;p&gt;Over the past 15 years, innovation has changed course: GPUs, born from gaming and scaled through accelerated computing, have surged upstream to remake supercomputing and carry the AI revolution to scientific computing’s most rarefied systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-87559 size-full aligncenter" height="1102" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-1.png" width="1816" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUPITER at Forschungszentrum Jülich is the emblem of this new era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is it among the most efficient supercomputers — producing 63.3 gigaflops per watt — but it’s also a powerhouse for AI, delivering 116 AI exaflops, up from 92 at ISC High Performance 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the “flip” in action. In 2019, nearly 70% of the TOP100 high-performance computing systems were CPU-only. Today, that number has plunged below 15%, with 88 of the TOP100 systems accelerated — and 80% of those powered by NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the broader TOP500, 388 systems, 78%, now use NVIDIA technology, including 218 GPU-accelerated systems (up 34 systems year over year) and 362 systems connected by high-performance NVIDIA networking. The trend is unmistakable: accelerated computing has become the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real revolution is in AI performance. With architectures like NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell and systems like JUPITER, researchers now have access to orders of magnitude more AI compute than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI FLOPS have become the new yardstick, enabling breakthroughs in climate modeling, drug discovery and quantum simulation — problems that demand both scale and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At SC16, years before today’s generative AI wave, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang saw what was coming. He predicted that AI would soon reshape the world’s most powerful computing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Several years ago, deep learning came along, like Thor’s hammer falling from the sky, and gave us an incredibly powerful tool to solve some of the most difficult problems in the world,” Huang declared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_87563"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-87563 size-full" height="312" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Picture1.jpg" width="468" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-87563"&gt;At SC16, Huang explained how AI would reshape the world’s most powerful scientific computing systems.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math behind computing power consumption had already made the shift to GPUs inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was the AI revolution, ignited by the NVIDIA CUDA-X computing platform built on those GPUs, that extended the capabilities of these machines dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, supercomputers could deliver meaningful science at double precision (FP64) as well as at mixed precision (FP32, FP16) and even at ultra-efficient formats like INT8 and beyond — the backbone of modern AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flexibility allowed researchers to stretch power budgets further than ever to run larger, more complex simulations and train deeper neural networks, all while maximizing performance per watt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even before AI took hold, the raw numbers had already forced the issue. Power budgets don’t negotiate. Supercomputer researchers — inside NVIDIA and across the community — were coming to grips with the road ahead, and it was paved with GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach exascale without a Hoover Dam‑sized electric bill, researchers needed acceleration. GPUs delivered far more operations per watt than CPUs. That was the pre‑AI tell of what was to come, and that’s why when the AI boom hit, large-scale GPU systems already had momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seeds were planted with Titan in 2012 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the first major U.S. systems to pair CPUs with GPUs at unprecedented scale — showing how hierarchical parallelism could unlock huge application gains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe in 2013, Piz Daint set a new bar for both performance and efficiency, then proved the point where it matters: real applications like COSMO forecasting for weather prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2017, the inflection was undeniable. Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Sierra at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory ushered in a new standard for leadership‑class systems: acceleration first. They didn’t just run faster; they changed the questions science could ask for climate modeling, genomics, materials and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These systems are able to do much more with much less. On the Green500 list of the most efficient systems, the top eight are NVIDIA‑accelerated, with NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand connecting 7 of the Top 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the story behind these headline numbers is how AI capabilities have become the yardstick: JUPITER delivers 116 AI exaflops alongside 1 EF FP64 — a clear signal of how science now blends simulation and AI.&lt;br /&gt;Power efficiency didn’t just make exascale attainable; it made AI at exascale practical. And once science had AI at scale, the curve bent sharply upward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What It Means Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about benchmarks. It’s about real science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster, more accurate weather and climate models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breakthroughs in drug discovery and genomics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulations of fusion reactors and quantum systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New frontiers in AI-driven research across every discipline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift started as a power-efficiency imperative, became an architectural advantage and has matured into a scientific superpower: simulation and AI, together, at unprecedented scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with scientific computing. Now, the rest of computing will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

And the promise to give brands visibility and control over this fast-growing search channel has made Peec AI one of Europe’s hottest startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just four months after its Seed round led by 20VC, the Berlin-based startup has raised a $21 million Series A led by European VC firm Singular. CEO Marius Meiners declined to disclose the valuation, but said it had tripled and was now above $100 million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This comes after Peec AI grew its annual recurring revenue to more than $4 million in only ten months since its launch, attracting 1,300 companies and agencies to its platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These customers use Peec AI to monitor how their brands appear in AI-powered searches. But beyond analytics on visibility and ranking, Peec AI also tracks sentiment — and which sources shape these answers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These insights are what make Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) possible — a way for marketing teams to optimize their brand’s presence in AI search results, similar to how SEO works for traditional search engines. With this promise, the startup says it is now adding some 300 customers a month, and its new funding will accelerate this growth while also supporting expansion plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Thanks to its new round, which was also backed by Antler, Combination VC, identity.vc, and S20, the startup plans to hire some 40 people in the next six months. These roles are mostly based in Berlin, where Meiners met his two cofounders in Antler’s Winter 2024 cohort: Tobias Siwonia is now Peec AI’s CTO, and Daniel Drabo is its CRO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Expanding fast and being visible may be key to winning in an emerging category that could soon become crowded, with competitors already including New York-based Profound and Austrian startup OtterlyAI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To help attract more talent, the 20-person startup is currently advertising itself on large outdoor ads throughout Germany’s capital city. But beyond its Berlin plans, Meiners told TechCrunch that Peec AI also plans to open a sales-focused office in New York City in the second quarter of next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As more GEO-focused tools become available, and SEO dashboards add AI tracking capabilities, Peec AI hopes to differentiate itself by offering marketing teams a dashboard that expands in scope while remaining simple to use, despite the fast-changing nature of AI searches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead of revolving around keywords like SEO tools, Peec AI’s dashboard centers on prompts for which brands would like to show up well in search results. Customers can track up to 25 prompts for €75 per month ($87), increasing to 100 prompts for €169 per month ($196). Both plans offer free trials, unlike its enterprise offering, which starts from €424 per month ($493).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To make these insights actionable, the dashboard also suggests actions that can improve visibility and positive sentiment. For instance, its home page suggests that a company that wants to be the answer to a query on “the best CRMs for fast-growing companies” may want to “join r/CRM subreddit discussions” on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This recommendation also relates to the “source insights” that are at the core of Peec AI and could guide the content strategy of its users. The startup observed that mentions in tier 1 media outlets don’t give more visibility than articles by lesser-known publications whose headlines are closer to the original question — for instance, on “the best healthcare investors in Berlin.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Companies that already use its tools include Axel Springer, Chanel, n8n, ElevenLabs, TUI, and more, as AI searches gain ground across sectors, both for B2C and for B2B searches. However, users also turn to ChatGPT and the like for many other tasks and requests, which means that the startup has to cut through noise behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To achieve this, Peec AI bought raw datasets of these requests, but that’s just the beginning. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;We have to filter all these out to really get the questions that people ask around brands or purchases and products and services,” Meiners said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For all the simplicity on the outside, that proprietary data pipeline may be the key to Peec AI’s success. This also serves as a reminder that the AI value chain is not only about models and that the AI application layer and underlying data have become a prime territory for European startups, now including Peec AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a5fadec4-271b-4ce6-bdd2-504484c36964.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;With consumers increasingly asking questions of ChatGPT — not Google — product discovery is changing.

They need to manage a growing mix of hardware and software, keep control of their data, and make sure their systems can grow over time. Recent research shows that most organisations feel safer working with a trusted partner when adopting new technology, and many see more value when AI can operate closer to their own data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA is built around that idea. It combines Dell’s full stack of infrastructure with NVIDIA’s AI tools, supported by Dell’s professional services team. The goal is to help companies move from ideas to real results while keeping technical complexity in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faster-deployment-through-integrated-platforms"&gt;Faster deployment through integrated platforms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell is expanding its storage and AI capabilities to help organisations automate setup, improve performance, and run real-time AI tasks with more consistency. ObjectScale and PowerScale, the storage engines behind the Dell AI Data Platform, now work with the NVIDIA NIXL library from NVIDIA Dynamo. This integration supports scalable KV Cache storage and sharing, enabling a one-second Time to First Token at a 131K-token context window, while helping reduce costs and ease pressure on GPU memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA also adds support for Dell PowerEdge XE7740 and XE7745 systems equipped with the NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs and NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. According to Dell, these systems give organisations more room to run larger multimodal models, agent-style workloads, training tasks, and enterprise inferencing with stronger performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell says the addition of the Dell Automation Platform is meant to remove guesswork by delivering tuned and validated deployments through a secure setup. The platform aims to produce repeatable results and give teams a clearer path to building AI workflows. Alongside this, software tools such as the AI code assistant with Tabnine and the agentic AI platform with Cohere North are becoming automated, helping teams move workloads into production faster and keep operations manageable as they scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond core data-centre systems, Dell’s AI PC ecosystem now supports devices with NVIDIA RTX Blackwell GPUs and NVIDIA RTX Ada GPUs, giving organisations more hardware options across Dell laptops and desktops. Dell Professional Services is also offering interactive pilots that use a customer’s own data to test AI ideas before large investments. These pilots focus on clear metrics and outcomes so teams can judge business value with more certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-generation-infrastructure-for-stronger-ai-performance"&gt;Next-generation infrastructure for stronger AI performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell is updating its infrastructure portfolio to support more complex AI and HPC workloads, with an emphasis on performance, scale, and easier management. The Dell PowerEdge XE8712, arriving next month, supports up to 144 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs in a standard rack. This makes rack-scale AI and HPC more accessible, backed by unified monitoring and automation through iDRAC, OpenManage Enterprise, and the Integrated Rack Controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise SONiC Distribution by Dell Technologies now supports NVIDIA Spectrum-X platforms along with NVIDIA’s Cumulus OS. This helps organisations build open, standards-based AI networks that can operate across different vendors. The latest SmartFabric Manager release also extends support to Dell’s Enterprise SONiC on NVIDIA Spectrum-X platforms, aiming to reduce deployment time and setup errors through guided automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-choice-through-an-expanded-ai-ecosystem"&gt;More choice through an expanded AI ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisations continue to adjust their AI budgets and plans, and many want flexibility in the tools they choose. Red Hat OpenShift for the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA is now validated on more Dell PowerEdge systems, giving teams more ways to run AI workloads at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support now includes both the Dell PowerEdge R760xa and the Dell PowerEdge XE9680 with NVIDIA H100 and H200 Tensor Core GPUs. This pairing brings together Red Hat’s controls and governance tools with Dell’s secure infrastructure, offering a clearer path for companies that need to scale AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell executives say the updates are meant to help organisations move from small pilots to real deployment. Jeff Clarke, vice chairman and chief operating officer at Dell Technologies, said the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA addresses a core challenge for many teams: “how to move from AI pilots to production without rebuilding their infrastructure.” He added that Dell has “done the integration work so customers don’t have to,” which he believes will help organisations deploy and scale with more confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA sees the shift as part of a broader change in how companies use AI. Justin Boitano, vice president of Enterprise AI products, described the moment as one where enterprise AI is moving from experimentation to transformation, advancing at a speed that is “redefining how businesses operate.” He said Dell and NVIDIA aim to support this transition with a unified platform that brings together infrastructure, automation, and data tools to help organisations “deploy AI at scale and realise measurable impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts see similar demand for integrated systems. Ashish Nadkarni, group vice president and general manager for Infrastructure Systems, Platforms and Technologies at IDC, said many teams want AI-ready systems that are powerful but also easier to run. He noted that the combination of Dell’s AI portfolio with NVIDIA’s technology represents “a significant step forward in delivering enterprise-ready AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image by Dell Technologies)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: 10% of Nvidia’s cost: Why Tesla-Intel chip partnership demands attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110608" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-7.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

They need to manage a growing mix of hardware and software, keep control of their data, and make sure their systems can grow over time. Recent research shows that most organisations feel safer working with a trusted partner when adopting new technology, and many see more value when AI can operate closer to their own data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA is built around that idea. It combines Dell’s full stack of infrastructure with NVIDIA’s AI tools, supported by Dell’s professional services team. The goal is to help companies move from ideas to real results while keeping technical complexity in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faster-deployment-through-integrated-platforms"&gt;Faster deployment through integrated platforms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell is expanding its storage and AI capabilities to help organisations automate setup, improve performance, and run real-time AI tasks with more consistency.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Databricks is holding conversations to raise a funding round that values the company at a minimum of $130 billion, according to reporting from The Information. The company hasn’t signed a term sheet yet, the report added.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That would prove a valuation bump of at least 30% over the $100 billion price tag Databricks achieved in its $1 billion Series J funding round in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the time, Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi told TechCrunch that the company raised the round to fund two specific projects: a database for AI agents and its AI agent platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The database market is $105 billion of TAM [total addressable market], of revenue, sitting there, kind of unaffected in the last 40 years,” Ghodsi told TechCrunch at the time. “Here’s the interesting statistic nobody’s paying attention to: a year ago, we saw in the data that 30% of the databases were not created by humans. For the first time, they were created by AI agents. And this year, the statistic is 80%.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Databricks bought open-source database startup Neon for $1 billion in May, which was one of the first transactions that kicked off a wave of consolidation in the database space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Databricks did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation and more information.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;em&gt;The Southeast Asia CEO’s Guide to AI Transformation&lt;/em&gt;, the authors say leaders should first look at how AI could reshape their industry and revenue plans, then put money into areas where they expect clear and measurable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region’s mix of cultures, income levels, and market sizes makes AI adoption harder than in places with more uniform conditions. People shop and behave differently between the different countries of the region, wages tend to be still low, and many firms don’t have the scale to run long and costly trials. These factors mean simple efficiency gains rarely deliver strong returns. Real gains come when AI is used to rethink how the business runs, make decisions faster, or increase capacity without growing the team, the Guide states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bain’s analysis shows that wages in Southeast Asia are about 7% of US levels, which limits how much companies can save from labour cuts. The report also notes that only 40% of the region’s market value comes from large firms, compared with 60% in India. With fewer big firms able to absorb early AI costs, leaders need to aim for speed, scale, and new processes instead of relying on cost savings alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How AI is helping today&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some organisations in the region are already seeing clear gains by linking their AI plans to business goals. The Guide highlights early moves like using AI to shorten product launch times or reduce supply chain issues, so opening new chances for revenue. A factory might use predictive models to reduce machine downtime and lift output, or a financial institution could use LLMs to support compliance work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bain senior partner Aadarsh Baijal says impact depends on how leaders think about their market. He believes many still see AI “as a rollout of software rather than a redesign of how the business competes.” When leaders understand how AI changes demand, pricing, operations, or customer needs, they can decide where to focus their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What the guide says about data, culture, and people in AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guide stresses that AI transformation relies on people, habits, and skills, not only technology. Many organisations think scaling AI is a hiring problem, but Bain argues that the talent often already exists in the business. The real issue is getting teams to work together and helping staff understand how to use AI in their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors describe two groups involved in successful change. The “Lab” is made up of technical teams who rebuild processes and create the first versions of new tools. The “Crowd” includes employees in the business who need enough AI awareness to use those tools day to day. Without both groups, projects stall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior partner Mohan Jayaraman says the strongest results appear when existing teams lead the work. In his view, impact increases when companies match small expert groups with wider training so new systems become part of normal workflows rather than one-off trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders also need to fix ongoing issues like data quality, how data is tracked, governance, and links to current systems. They also need to decide how their AI plans connect with existing technologies. Without this groundwork, early gains are hard to repeat at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A regional push to support enterprise AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bain is setting up an AI Innovation Hub in Singapore with support from the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB). The hub’s goal is to help companies move beyond trials by building AI systems that can run at scale. It will work in advanced manufacturing, energy and resources, financial services, healthcare, and consumer goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hub sits in a growing AI community in Singapore, which has more than a thousand startups and is expected to generate about S$198.3 billion in economic value from AI by 2030. Its work will cover production-ready systems like predictive maintenance for factories, AI support for regulatory tasks in finance, and personalisation tools for retail. It will also help companies build internal teams and engineering skills so they can run AI programmes on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As competition in Southeast Asia increases, firms that treat AI as a shift in how they operate – a central theme in Bain’s AI guide – will be better positioned to turn pilots into long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Is AI in a bubble?
