They are favoring digital services that are faster to deploy, easier to scale, and better integrated with partner ecosystems. Yet, one critical pillar has lagged: the network. While software-defined networking has made inroads, many organizations still operate rigid, pre-provisioned networks. As applications become increasingly distributed and dynamic—including hybrid cloud and edge deployments—a programmable, on-demand network infrastructure can enhance and enable this new era.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121548" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iStock-1742620693.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From CapEx to OpEx: The new connectivity mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another, practical concern is also driving this shift: the need for IT models that align cost with usage. Rising uncertainty about inflation, consumer spending, business investment, and global supply chains are just a few of the economic factors weighing on company decision-making. And chief information officers (CIOs) are scrutinizing capital-expenditure-heavy infrastructure more closely and increasingly adopting operating-expenses-based subscription models.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead of long-term circuit contracts and static provisioning, companies are looking for cloud-ready, on-demand network services that can scale, adapt, and integrate across hybrid environments. This trend is fueling demand for API-first network infrastructure connectivity that behaves like software, dynamically orchestrated and integrated into enterprise IT ecosystems. There has been such rapid interest, the global network API market is projected to surge from $1.53 billion in 2024 to over $72 billion in 2034.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In fact, McKinsey estimates the network API market could unlock between $100 billion and $300 billion in connectivity- and edge-computing-related revenue for telecom operators over the next five to seven years, with an additional $10 billion to $30 billion generated directly from APIs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When the cloud came in, first there was a trickle of adoptions. And then there was a deluge,” says Rajarshi Purkayastha, VP of solutions at Tata Communications. “We’re seeing the same trend with programmable networks. What was once a niche industry is now becoming mainstream as CIOs prioritize agility and time-to-value.”&lt;/p&gt; 
   &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programmable networks as a catalyst for innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Programmable subscription-based networks are not just about efficiency, they are about enabling faster innovation, better user experiences, and global scalability. Organizations are preferring API-first systems to avoid vendor lock-in, enable multi-vendor integration, and foster innovation. API-first approaches allow seamless integration across different hardware and software stacks, reducing operational complexity and costs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With APIs, enterprises can provision bandwidth, configure services, and connect to clouds and edge locations in real time, all through automation layers embedded in their DevOps and application platforms. This makes the network an active enabler of digital transformation rather than a lagging dependency.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, Netflix—one of the earliest adopters of microservices—handles billions of API requests daily through over 500 microservices and gateways, supporting global scalability and rapid innovation. After a two-year transition period, it redesigned its IT structure and organized it using microservice architecture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Coca-Cola integrated its global systems using APIs, enabling faster, lower-cost delivery and improved cross-functional collaboration. And Uber moved to microservices with API gateways, allowing independent scaling and rapid deployment across markets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In each case, the network had to evolve from being static and hardware-bound to dynamic, programmable, and consumption-based. “API-first infrastructure fits naturally into how today’s IT teams work,” says Purkayastha. “It aligns with continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and service orchestration tools. That reduces friction and accelerates how fast enterprises can launch new services.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powering on-demand connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tata Communications deployed Network Fabric—its programmable platform that uses APIs to allow enterprise systems to request and adjust network resources dynamically—to help a global software-as-a-service (SaaS) company modernize how it manages network capacity in response to real-time business needs. As the company scaled its digital services worldwide, it needed a more agile, cost-efficient way to align network performance with unpredictable traffic surges and fast-changing user demands. With Tata’s platform, the company’s operations teams were able to automatically scale bandwidth in key regions for peak performance, during high-impact events like global software releases. And just as quickly scale down once demand normalized, avoiding unnecessary costs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In another scenario, when the SaaS provider needed to run large-scale data operations between its US and Asia hubs, the network was programmatically reconfigured in under an hour; a process that previously required weeks of planning and provisioning. “What we delivered wasn’t just bandwidth, it was the ability for their teams to take control,” says Purkayastha. “By integrating our Network Fabric APIs into their automation workflows, we gave them a network that responds at the pace of their business.”&lt;/p&gt; 

   &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barriers to transformation — and how to overcome them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Transforming network infrastructure is no small task. Many enterprises still rely on legacy multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) and hardware-defined wide-area network (WAN) architectures. These environments are rigid, manually managed, and often incompatible with modern APIs or automation frameworks. As with any organization, barriers can be both technical and internal, and legacy devices may not support programmable interfaces. Organizations are often siloed, meaning networks are managed separately to application and DevOps workflows.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, CIOs face pressure for quick returns and may not even remain in the company long enough to oversee the process and results, making it harder to push for long-term network modernization strategies. “Often, it’s easier to address the low-hanging fruit rather than go after the transformation because decision-makers may not be around to see the transformation come to life,” says Purkayastha.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But quick fixes or workarounds may not yield the desired results; transformation is needed instead. “Enterprises have historically built their networks for stability, not agility,” says Purkayastha. “But now, that same rigidity becomes a bottleneck when applications, users, and workloads are distributed across the cloud, edge, and remote locations.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, there is a clear path forward, starting with overlay orchestration, well-defined API contracts, and security-first design. Instead of completely removing and replacing an existing system, many enterprises are layering APIs over existing infrastructure, enabling controlled migrations and real-time service automation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t just help customers adopt APIs, we guide them through the operational shift it requires,” says Purkayastha. “We have blueprints for what to automate first, how to manage hybrid environments, and how to design for resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For some organizations, there will be resistance to the change initially. Fears of extra workloads, or misalliance with teams’ existing goals and objectives are common, as is the deeply human distrust of change. These can be overcome, however. “There are playbooks on what we’ve done earlier—learnings from transformation—which we share with clients,” says Purkayastha. “We also plan for the unknowns. We usually reserve 10% of time and resources just to manage unforeseen risks, and the result is an empowered organization to scale innovation and reduce operational complexity.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

These are yet more warning signs of how careful we have to be when it comes to using AI to make important decisions for our physical and mental states.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/27/1122356/the-ai-hype-index-ai-designed-antibiotics-show-promise/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 14:07:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Plaud launches a new AI hardware notetaker, the $179 Note Pro (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/plaud-launches-a-new-ai-hardware-notetaker-the-179-note-pro/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Hardware company Plaud.ai released its new physical notetaker, the Plaud AI Pro, on Wednesday. The notetaker, priced at $179, comes two years after the original Plaud Note was released, and a year after the company released an AI pin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For people who haven’t seen one, the Plaud Note is a credit-card-sized hardware notetaker, which can stick on the back of your phone and help you take notes for calls or in-person meetings.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Note Pro looks similar to the original Note, but there’s one major difference. The new device has a small 0.95-inch AMOLED screen, which shows information like a recording indicator and battery level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An image of Plaud AI hardware notetaker displaying battery level on its tiny screen." class="wp-image-3040223" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Plaud.ai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Note Pro offers a 30-hour recording capacity for the standard range. But you can push the device to record for 50 hours with a shorter range of 9.8 feet (nearly 3 meters) on a single charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said that the Note Pro has four MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) mics, compared with two on the last-gen device, to better capture audio. Because of this, the Note Pro can capture audio within the range of 16.4 feet (nearly 5 meters), resulting in a 2x jump in range from the original Note Pro. The startup said users will get better noise suppression and speaker detection with the new device, as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While you had to manually switch between calls and in-person recording on the original Note, the Note Pro uses an auto-detection feature for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plaud.ai is also updating its companion app with new features. You can take notes in text on your phone — just like Granola — and add images, like slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The app update also offers  “multidimensional summaries,” which allow you to extract insights in different formats, such as key insights or data items. The company built templates for summary generation, and the app can automatically suggest the right one based on your role. Plus, you can build your own templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An Image showing a person using Plaud AI notetaker while adding an image to notes using Plaud's app" class="wp-image-3040224" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Highlight-Multimodal-AI.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Plaud.ai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another new feature, still in beta, allows you to query your notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Plaud Note Pro is priced at $179/£169, and users can preorder the device starting today, with shipping slated for October 2025. The company said people preordering the device will get 600 complimentary transcription minutes along with a magnetic case. Users can get 300 minutes of monthly transcription for free, and if they want more, they need to buy a paid monthly plan or a one-time top-up.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plaud is one of the companies that has been successfully chugging along when other AI device makers haven’t had a lot of popularity. Exor-backed Bee got acquired by Amazon, and Friend just started shipping after a few delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plaud said that it has shipped over a million units of its AI hardware notetakers, with nearly 50% users upgrading to the Pro plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Hardware company Plaud.ai released its new physical notetaker, the Plaud AI Pro, on Wednesday.

Google is aiming to change that narrative with Vids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, it seems to be finding its audience. Google announced that Vids has already rocketed past one million monthly active users, a clear sign that teams are crying out for simpler ways to bring their ideas to life with video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-photos-now-move-and-avatars-do-the-talking"&gt;Your photos now move, and avatars do the talking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the latest additions is the ability to turn static images into motion pictures. Imagine you’ve got a great photo of a new product but need something more engaging for a social media post or presentation. You can now upload that picture to Vids, type a quick prompt describing what you want to happen, and Google’s Veo AI will turn it into an eight-second animated clip, complete with sound. It’s a simple way to create eye-catching, brand-aligned content in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt; [embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who dreads being on camera, the new AI avatars will be a welcome relief. This feature lets you produce a polished video without ever stepping in front of a lens. You write your script, choose from a selection of digital presenters, and the AI handles the delivery. It’s perfect for creating consistent training guides, product demos, or team updates without worrying about lighting, background noise, or re-recording twenty takes to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt; [embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is also tackling the tedious task of editing. A new automatic transcript trimming tool listens to your recordings and, with a few clicks, snips out all the filler words and awkward silences. Speaking from plenty of experience, that will be a huge time-saver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt; [embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this, the company confirmed that familiar tools from Google Meet – like noise cancellation, custom backgrounds, and appearance filters – are set to arrive next month. Google Vids will also soon support portrait and square formats, making it much easier to create content for different platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-started-with-google-vids"&gt;Getting started with Google Vids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these new tools, Google is trying to make video creation as routine as building a slide deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is broadening access to Google Vids, making it available to more Workspace customers on business and education plans. Better yet, a basic version of the Vids editor is now completely free for all consumers, offering a range of templates to help you create anything from a tutorial to a party invitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get everyone up to speed, Google has also launched a new “Vids on Vids” instructional series. The video guides walk you through the entire process, demonstrates the best features, and offers practical tips to help you create professional-looking content quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt; [embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-businesses-are-seeing-the-benefit"&gt;Real businesses are seeing the benefit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies are already putting Vids to work.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Malaysian chip design company SkyeChip announced its MARS1000 processor at an industry event on Monday, Bloomberg reported. While an edge processor isn’t as powerful as an advanced Nvidia chip, it still represents a technological milestone for Malaysia, which is looking to play a bigger role in the global AI race.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Malaysia already has a foothold in the chip manufacturing sector and has recently increased its efforts and investment around AI. The country announced the creation of the Malaysian National AI Office in late 2024, an agency that plans to focus on seven areas, including the acceleration of AI adoption, AI adoption regulatory frameworks, and AI ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was rumored in early July that the Trump administration was considering restricting the sale of U.S. AI chips to Malaysia, and Thailand, in an attempt to prevent smuggling of these chips to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While those rumors have yet to come to fruition, Malaysia’s Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry announced that it was going to require trade permits for U.S. AI chips on July 14. This rule means individuals and companies are required to notify the Malaysian government at least 30 days in advance if they plan to export or transship U.S.-made AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2026266993.jpg?resize=1200,686" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Malaysia has developed its first domestic edge AI processor. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;As AI assistants become capable of controlling web browsers, a new security challenge has emerged: users must now trust that every website they visit won't try to hijack their AI agent with hidden malicious instructions. Experts voiced concerns about this emerging threat this week after testing from a leading AI chatbot vendor revealed that AI browser agents can be successfully tricked into harmful actions nearly a quarter of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Anthropic announced the launch of Claude for Chrome, a web browser-based AI agent that can take actions on behalf of users. Due to security concerns, the extension is only rolling out as a research preview to 1,000 subscribers on Anthropic's Max plan, which costs between $100 and $200 per month, with a waitlist available for other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Claude for Chrome extension allows users to chat with the Claude AI model in a sidebar window that maintains the context of everything happening in their browser. Users can grant Claude permission to perform tasks like managing calendars, scheduling meetings, drafting email responses, handling expense reports, and testing website features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser extension builds on Anthropic's Computer Use capability, which the company released in October 2024. Computer Use is an experimental feature that allows Claude to take screenshots and control a user's mouse cursor to perform tasks, but the new Chrome extension provides more direct browser integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zooming out, it appears Anthropic's browser extension reflects a new phase of AI lab competition. In July, Perplexity launched its own browser, Comet, which features an AI agent that attempts to offload tasks for users. OpenAI recently released ChatGPT Agent, a bot that uses its own sandboxed browser to take actions on the web. Google has also launched Gemini integrations with Chrome in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this rush to integrate AI into browsers has exposed a fundamental security flaw that could put users at serious risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security challenges and safety measures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the Chrome extension launch, Anthropic says it has conducted extensive testing that revealed browser-using AI models can face prompt-injection attacks, where malicious actors embed hidden instructions into websites to trick AI systems into performing harmful actions without user knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The company tested 123 cases representing 29 different attack scenarios and found a 23.6 percent attack success rate when browser use operated without safety mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example involved a malicious email that instructed Claude to delete a user's emails for "mailbox hygiene" purposes. Without safeguards, Claude followed these instructions and deleted the user's emails without confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic says it has implemented several defenses to address these vulnerabilities. Users can grant or revoke Claude's access to specific websites through site-level permissions. The system requires user confirmation before Claude takes high-risk actions like publishing, purchasing, or sharing personal data. The company has also blocked Claude from accessing websites offering financial services, adult content, and pirated content by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These safety measures reduced the attack success rate from 23.6 percent to 11.2 percent in autonomous mode. On a specialized test of four browser-specific attack types, the new mitigations reportedly reduced the success rate from 35.7 percent to 0 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent AI researcher Simon Willison, who has extensively written about AI security risks and coined the term "prompt injection" in 2022, called the remaining 11.2 percent attack rate "catastrophic," writing on his blog that "in the absence of 100% reliable protection I have trouble imagining a world in which it's a good idea to unleash this pattern."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By "pattern," Willison is referring to the recent trend of integrating AI agents into web browsers. "I strongly expect that the entire concept of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely," he wrote in an earlier post on similar prompt-injection security issues recently found in Perplexity Comet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security risks are no longer theoretical. Last week, Brave's security team discovered that Perplexity's Comet browser could be tricked into accessing users' Gmail accounts and triggering password recovery flows through malicious instructions hidden in Reddit posts. When users asked Comet to summarize a Reddit thread, attackers could embed invisible commands that instructed the AI to open Gmail in another tab, extract the user's email address, and perform unauthorized actions. Although Perplexity attempted to fix the vulnerability, Brave later confirmed that its mitigations were defeated and the security hole remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Anthropic plans to use its new research preview to identify and address attack patterns that emerge in real-world usage before making the Chrome extension more widely available. In the absence of good protections from AI vendors, the burden of security falls on the user, who is taking a large risk by using these tools on the open web. As Willison noted in his post about Claude for Chrome, "I don't think it's reasonable to expect end users to make good decisions about the security risks."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Security challenges and safety measures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the Chrome extension launch, Anthropic says it has conducted extensive testing that revealed browser-using AI models can face prompt-injection attacks, where malicious actors embed hidden instructions into websites to trick AI systems into performing harmful actions without user knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The company tested 123 cases representing 29 different attack scenarios and found a 23.6 percent attack success rate when browser use operated without safety mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example involved a malicious email that instructed Claude to delete a user's emails for "mailbox hygiene" purposes. Without safeguards, Claude followed these instructions and deleted the user's emails without confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic says it has implemented several defenses to address these vulnerabilities. Users can grant or revoke Claude's access to specific websites through site-level permissions. The system requires user confirmation before Claude takes high-risk actions like publishing, purchasing, or sharing personal data. The company has also blocked Claude from accessing websites offering financial services, adult content, and pirated content by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These safety measures reduced the attack success rate from 23.6 percent to 11.2 percent in autonomous mode. On a specialized test of four browser-specific attack types, the new mitigations reportedly reduced the success rate from 35.7 percent to 0 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent AI researcher Simon Willison, who has extensively written about AI security risks and coined the term "prompt injection" in 2022, called the remaining 11.2 percent attack rate "catastrophic," writing on his blog that "in the absence of 100% reliable protection I have trouble imagining a world in which it's a good idea to unleash this pattern."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By "pattern," Willison is referring to the recent trend of integrating AI agents into web browsers. "I strongly expect that the entire concept of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely," he wrote in an earlier post on similar prompt-injection security issues recently found in Perplexity Comet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security risks are no longer theoretical. Last week, Brave's security team discovered that Perplexity's Comet browser could be tricked into accessing users' Gmail accounts and triggering password recovery flows through malicious instructions hidden in Reddit posts. When users asked Comet to summarize a Reddit thread, attackers could embed invisible commands that instructed the AI to open Gmail in another tab, extract the user's email address, and perform unauthorized actions. Although Perplexity attempted to fix the vulnerability, Brave later confirmed that its mitigations were defeated and the security hole remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Anthropic plans to use its new research preview to identify and address attack patterns that emerge in real-world usage before making the Chrome extension more widely available. In the absence of good protections from AI vendors, the burden of security falls on the user, who is taking a large risk by using these tools on the open web. As Willison noted in his post about Claude for Chrome, "I don't think it's reasonable to expect end users to make good decisions about the security risks."&lt;/p&gt;

Under the umbrella of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), teams have been split into specialized groups: TBD Lab (large-language‑model development), FAIR (long‑term research), Products &amp;amp; Applied Research, and MSL Infra (infrastructure). The reorganization, communicated in an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ai-superintelligence-labs-reorg-alexandr-wang-memo-2025-8" rel="rel"&gt;internal memo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, also dissolved the AGI Foundations team, redistributing its members across the new structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any new hires or transfers across Meta’s AI teams now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-hiring-freeze-fda6b3c4" rel="rel"&gt;require&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Wang’s personal approval.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s AI reorganization reflects high stakes in a competitive race with other AI companies. Yet, as Meta accelerates toward superintelligence, its chatbot controversy demonstrates that its ambitions are outpacing both internal controls and external oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks after the Trump administration approved Nvidia’s H20 chip exports to China under a 15% revenue-sharing arrangement, the deal is facing an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia made a deal with the White House to sell H20s (and possibly a new chip model) to China.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Last month, the White House struck a deal with Nvidia which allowed the company to export H20s to China on the condition it shared 15% of its revenue with the US government. President Trump recently suggested he might also allow Nvidia to export a scaled-down version of their next-generation Blackwell chips. The chip in question (the B30A) would offer about half the performance of Nvidia's flagship B300 and could be shipped as early as September.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deal faces political opposition and legal uncertainty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Selling AI chips China faces political opposition on national security grounds. A group of six democratic senators wrote &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/a/3a2a1db4-65d2-4377-822a-5f245d53b28f/62DE3F69670AE9734557935EEC1CB6A941532F5BA23C1E543B74B4EECAD3D420.250815.trump-senate-15-percent-fee-letter.signed.pdf" rel="rel"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to the White House arguing that its deal with Nvidia undermines US national security by giving the PRC access to a critical military technology. The deal’s revenue-sharing condition—in effect, an export tax—also faces &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5446890-nvidia-amd-china-chip-deal/" rel="rel"&gt;legal challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Export taxes are barred under both the Constitution and federal law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese regulators issued guidance against H20 purchases after comments by Sec. Lutnick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; China urged Defending the H20 deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the U.S. strategy was to offer China inferior AI chips: “We don’t sell them our best stuff… not even our third‑best,” adding that the goal was for Chinese developers to get “addicted to the American technology stack.” Chinese regulators &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b8e30c54-b71c-4113-8b3e-8f54bc36587d" rel="rel"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; deemed the comments “insulting,” provoking efforts to discourage Nvidia chip purchases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A week after Lunick’s comments, China’s Cyberspace Administration (CAC) issued guidance urging Chinese companies to suspend H20 orders. Nvidia is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-asks-foxconn-suspend-work-h20-chip-sources-say-2025-08-22/" rel="rel"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; halting production of H20s in response to decreased demand from China.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renting AI chips might be better than selling them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Instead of selling chips to China, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/08/america-should-rent-not-sell-ai-chips-to-china.html" rel="rel"&gt;renting AI chips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; via remote cloud services would offer the US greater leverage than outright sales. Cloud access preserves US control: chips remain physically in custody, and access can be revoked. This model could generate revenue for both chipmakers and cloud providers while curbing diversion to unauthorized users like the Chinese military.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;See also: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/ai_risks?lang=en" rel="rel"&gt;CAIS’ X account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, our paper on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationalsecurity.ai/" rel="rel"&gt;superintelligence strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aisafetybook.com/" rel="rel"&gt;AI safety course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://ai-frontiers.org/" rel="rel"&gt;AI Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a new platform for expert commentary and analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/ai-safety-newsletter-62-big-tech?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel="rel"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Welcome to the AI Safety Newsletter by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.safe.ai/" rel="rel"&gt;Center for AI Safety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

Meta California is led by Meta executives Brian Rice and Greg Maurer and is expected to deploy tens of millions of dollars to support candidates—across party lines—who oppose AI regulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meta is facing bipartisan outrage and an ongoing probe after Reuters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/" rel="rel"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on internal company documents that permitted its AI chatbots to engage in romantic and sensual conversations with minors—drawing fresh scrutiny as the company reorganizes its AI division.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta allowed its chatbots to have sensual conversations with children.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; An internal policy document permitted Meta AI chatbots to interact with children in “romantic or sensual” contexts—such as describing a child’s body as “a work of art.” Although Meta removed these sections of its policy when questioned by Reuters, the rules had been approved and in effect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gjRH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3587369f-4268-4546-b4ed-9743fccad5d8_1600x505.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="460" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gjRH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3587369f-4268-4546-b4ed-9743fccad5d8_1600x505.png" width="1456" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;An exerpt from Meta’s policies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/" rel="rel"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The revelation provoked congressional scrutiny.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Congress Senator Josh Hawley (R‑MO) launched a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/kids-deserve-protection-hawley-launches-investigation-into-meta-for-training-its-ai-chatbots-to-target-children-with-sensual-conversation/" rel="rel"&gt;Senate inquiry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; into Meta’s policies, requesting that the company preserve all relevant communications and clarify whether its chatbots enable “exploitation, deception or other criminal harms to children.” A bipartisan group of senators also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-leads-bipartisan-group-of-10-senators-in-pressing-meta-for-safeguards-around-childrens-engagement-with-ai-chatbots" rel="rel"&gt;sent a letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to Meta demanding it publicly disclose its updated policies and specifically forbid romantic chatbot interactions with minors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta is in the middle of reorganizing its AI division.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; As Meta is fielding congressional backlash, the company is also in the middle of a major internal reorganization of its AI division. Under the umbrella of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), teams have been split into specialized groups: TBD Lab (large-language‑model development), FAIR (long‑term research), Products &amp;amp; Applied Research, and MSL Infra (infrastructure). The reorganization, communicated in an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ai-superintelligence-labs-reorg-alexandr-wang-memo-2025-8" rel="rel"&gt;internal memo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, also dissolved the AGI Foundations team, redistributing its members across the new structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any new hires or transfers across Meta’s AI teams now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-hiring-freeze-fda6b3c4" rel="rel"&gt;require&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Wang’s personal approval.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s AI reorganization reflects high stakes in a competitive race with other AI companies. Yet, as Meta accelerates toward superintelligence, its chatbot controversy demonstrates that its ambitions are outpacing both internal controls and external oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks after the Trump administration approved Nvidia’s H20 chip exports to China under a 15% revenue-sharing arrangement, the deal is facing an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia made a deal with the White House to sell H20s (and possibly a new chip model) to China.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Last month, the White House struck a deal with Nvidia which allowed the company to export H20s to China on the condition it shared 15% of its revenue with the US government. President Trump recently suggested he might also allow Nvidia to export a scaled-down version of their next-generation Blackwell chips. The chip in question (the B30A) would offer about half the performance of Nvidia's flagship B300 and could be shipped as early as September.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deal faces political opposition and legal uncertainty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Selling AI chips China faces political opposition on national security grounds. A group of six democratic senators wrote &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/a/3a2a1db4-65d2-4377-822a-5f245d53b28f/62DE3F69670AE9734557935EEC1CB6A941532F5BA23C1E543B74B4EECAD3D420.250815.trump-senate-15-percent-fee-letter.signed.pdf" rel="rel"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to the White House arguing that its deal with Nvidia undermines US national security by giving the PRC access to a critical military technology. The deal’s revenue-sharing condition—in effect, an export tax—also faces &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5446890-nvidia-amd-china-chip-deal/" rel="rel"&gt;legal challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Export taxes are barred under both the Constitution and federal law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese regulators issued guidance against H20 purchases after comments by Sec. Lutnick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; China urged Defending the H20 deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the U.S. strategy was to offer China inferior AI chips: “We don’t sell them our best stuff… not even our third‑best,” adding that the goal was for Chinese developers to get “addicted to the American technology stack.” Chinese regulators &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b8e30c54-b71c-4113-8b3e-8f54bc36587d" rel="rel"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; deemed the comments “insulting,” provoking efforts to discourage Nvidia chip purchases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A week after Lunick’s comments, China’s Cyberspace Administration (CAC) issued guidance urging Chinese companies to suspend H20 orders. Nvidia is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-asks-foxconn-suspend-work-h20-chip-sources-say-2025-08-22/" rel="rel"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; halting production of H20s in response to decreased demand from China.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renting AI chips might be better than selling them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Instead of selling chips to China, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/08/america-should-rent-not-sell-ai-chips-to-china.html" rel="rel"&gt;renting AI chips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; via remote cloud services would offer the US greater leverage than outright sales. Cloud access preserves US control: chips remain physically in custody, and access can be revoked. This model could generate revenue for both chipmakers and cloud providers while curbing diversion to unauthorized users like the Chinese military.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;See also: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/ai_risks?lang=en" rel="rel"&gt;CAIS’ X account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, our paper on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationalsecurity.ai/" rel="rel"&gt;superintelligence strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aisafetybook.com/" rel="rel"&gt;AI safety course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://ai-frontiers.org/" rel="rel"&gt;AI Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a new platform for expert commentary and analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/ai-safety-newsletter-62-big-tech?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel="rel"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/ai-safety-newsletter-62-big-tech</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:29:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Here are the 33 US AI startups that have raised $100M or more in 2025 (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/here-are-the-33-us-ai-startups-that-have-raised-100m-or-more-in-2025/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1485726179-1.jpg?resize=1200,720" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Last year was monumental for the AI industry in the U.S. and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

The effort aimed to surface blind spots in each company’s internal evaluations and demonstrate how leading AI companies can work together on safety and alignment work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an interview with TechCrunch, OpenAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba said this kind of collaboration is increasingly important now that AI is entering a “consequential” stage of development, where AI models are used by millions of people every day.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There’s a broader question of how the industry sets a standard for safety and collaboration, despite the billions of dollars invested, as well as the war for talent, users, and the best products,” said Zaremba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The joint safety research, published Wednesday by both companies, arrives amid an arms race among leading AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic, where billion-dollar data center bets and $100 million compensation packages for top researchers have become table stakes. Some experts warn that the intensity of product competition could pressure companies to cut corners on safety in the rush to build more powerful systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To make this research possible, OpenAI and Anthropic granted each other special API access to versions of their AI models with fewer safeguards (OpenAI notes that GPT-5 was not tested because it hadn’t been released yet). Shortly after the research was conducted, however, Anthropic revoked the API access of another team at OpenAI. At the time, Anthropic claimed that OpenAI violated its terms of service, which prohibits using Claude to improve competing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zaremba says the events were unrelated and that he expects competition to stay fierce even as AI safety teams try to work together. Nicholas Carlini, a safety researcher with Anthropic, tells TechCrunch that he would like to continue allowing OpenAI safety researchers to access Claude models in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We want to increase collaboration wherever it’s possible across the safety frontier, and try to make this something that happens more regularly,” said Carlini.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the most stark findings in the study relates to hallucination testing. Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 models refused to answer up to 70% of questions when they were unsure of the correct answer, instead offering responses like, “I don’t have reliable information.” Meanwhile, OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini models refuse to answer questions far less, but showed much higher hallucination rates, attempting to answer questions when they didn’t have enough information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zaremba says the right balance is likely somewhere in the middle — OpenAI’s models should refuse to answer more questions, while Anthropic’s models should probably attempt to offer more answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sycophancy, the tendency for AI models to reinforce negative behavior in users to please them, has emerged as one of the most pressing safety concerns around AI models.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In Anthropic’s research report, the company identified examples of “extreme” sycophancy in GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4 — in which the models initially pushed back on psychotic or manic behavior, but later validated some concerning decisions. In other AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic, researchers observed lower levels of sycophancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, parents of a 16-year-old boy, Adam Raine, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming that ChatGPT (specifically a version powered by GPT-4o) offered their son advice that aided in his suicide, rather than pushing back on his suicidal thoughts. The lawsuit suggests this may be the latest example of AI chatbot sycophancy contributing to tragic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s hard to imagine how difficult this is to their family,” said Zaremba when asked about the incident. “It would be a sad story if we build AI that solves all these complex PhD level problems, invents new science, and at the same time, we have people with mental health problems as a consequence of interacting with it. This is a dystopian future that I’m not excited about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a blog post, OpenAI says that it significantly improved the sycophancy of its AI chatbots with GPT-5, compared to GPT-4o, claiming the model is better at responding to mental health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Moving forward, Zaremba and Carlini say they would like Anthropic and OpenAI to collaborate more on safety testing, looking into more subjects and testing future models, and they hope other AI labs will follow their collaborative approach.&lt;/p&gt;

Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 models refused to answer up to 70% of questions when they were unsure of the correct answer, instead offering responses like, “I don’t have reliable information.” Meanwhile, OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini models refuse to answer questions far less, but showed much higher hallucination rates, attempting to answer questions when they didn’t have enough information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zaremba says the right balance is likely somewhere in the middle — OpenAI’s models should refuse to answer more questions, while Anthropic’s models should probably attempt to offer more answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sycophancy, the tendency for AI models to reinforce negative behavior in users to please them, has emerged as one of the most pressing safety concerns around AI models.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In Anthropic’s research report, the company identified examples of “extreme” sycophancy in GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4 — in which the models initially pushed back on psychotic or manic behavior, but later validated some concerning decisions. In other AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic, researchers observed lower levels of sycophancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, parents of a 16-year-old boy, Adam Raine, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming that ChatGPT (specifically a version powered by GPT-4o) offered their son advice that aided in his suicide, rather than pushing back on his suicidal thoughts. The lawsuit suggests this may be the latest example of AI chatbot sycophancy contributing to tragic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s hard to imagine how difficult this is to their family,” said Zaremba when asked about the incident. “It would be a sad story if we build AI that solves all these complex PhD level problems, invents new science, and at the same time, we have people with mental health problems as a consequence of interacting with it. This is a dystopian future that I’m not excited about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a blog post, OpenAI says that it significantly improved the sycophancy of its AI chatbots with GPT-5, compared to GPT-4o, claiming the model is better at responding to mental health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Moving forward, Zaremba and Carlini say they would like Anthropic and OpenAI to collaborate more on safety testing, looking into more subjects and testing future models, and they hope other AI labs will follow their collaborative approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2:00pm PT: This article was updated to include additional research from Anthropic that was not initially made available to TechCrunch ahead of publication.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The report, in its fifth iteration, showcases two and a half years of data about consumers’ evolving use of AI products.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And for the fifth time, 14 companies appeared on the list of top AI products: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Poe, Character AI, Midjourney, Leonardo, Veed, Cutout, ElevenLabs, Photoroom, Gamma, QuillBot, Civitai, and Hugging Face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="AI all star companies on a global map" class="wp-image-3040473" height="423" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Top-Gen-AI-Map.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;a16z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The companies represent a cross section of how consumers are using AI: for general assistance, companionship, image and video editing, voice generation, productivity, and model hosting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Five other companies appeared on all but the first report, the firm notes, including Claude, DeepAI, Janitor AI, Pixelcut, and Suno, representing general AI use, companionship, image editing, and music generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3040476" height="431" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Top-Gen-AI-Web-Top-50-List.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;a16z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For the first time in the series of reports, Google gained four spots on the list of the top generative AI consumer web products with entries for Gemini, AI Studio, NotebookLM, and Google Labs. These products now have their own separate domains, allowing their growth to be tracked separately from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Andreessen Horowitz says its report relies on data from third-party market intelligence firms, including Similarweb, for web products and Sensor Tower for mobile app data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="general LMM assistant monthly web visits, excluding gemini and chatgpt" class="wp-image-3040470" height="549" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Top-Gen-AI-General-LLM-Monthly-Web-Visits.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;a16z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of note, No. 2 app Gemini is closing the gap to No. 1 app ChatGPT on mobile devices, but with almost half as many monthly active users. Not surprisingly, Gemini’s AI technology sees stronger adoption on Android, with nearly 90% of the monthly active user base. On the web, Gemini also came in second place behind ChatGPT, with approximately 12% of ChatGPT’s visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Google AI properties traffic" class="wp-image-3040471" height="480" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Top-Gen-AI-Google-AI-Properties-Traffic.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;a16z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s AI Studio, a developer-oriented sandbox for building with Gemini models, entered the top 10 list of AI web products, sitting in the 10th spot; NotebookLM was No. 13. Google Labs, a destination for Google’s AI experiments (e.g., Flow, Project Mariner, and Doppl), ranked at No. 39.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="NotebookLM visits over time" class="wp-image-3040474" height="466" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Top-Gen-AI-NotebookLM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;a16z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The report indicates that Meta AI and Grok are also chasing the top AI app, ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Grok ranked fourth on the web and No. 23 on mobile. This is quick growth, given that Grok went from having no stand-alone app at the end of 2024 (it was first launched on X) to now, with upward of 20 million monthly active users. In July 2025, Grok also climbed nearly 40% when Grok 4 was released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Grok global DAUs, mobile app" class="wp-image-3040472" height="475" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Top-Gen-AI-Grok-Global-DAU.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;a16z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta’s general assistant ranked No. 46 on the web — the same as in March — but it didn’t make the list of top mobile AI apps. In part, it was hampered by the news that Meta AI was sharing some users’ posts publicly on the web without their informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="top 50 gen AI mobile apps by MAUs" class="wp-image-3040468" height="439" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Top-Gen-AI-Apps-Top-50-List.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;a16z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DeepSeek and Claude also saw their growth flatten on mobile, with the former falling off its peak by 22%. On the web, DeepSeek saw an even sharper drop-off, down more than 40% from its peak in February 2025. Perplexity and Claude, however, continued to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other Chinese AI makers also made the top 20 on the web, including No. 9 Quark, Alibaba’s AI assistant (No. 47 on the mobile list); No. 12 Doubao, ByteDance’s general LLM product (No. 4 on mobile); and No. 17 Kimi, a chatbot from Moonshot AI. Each of these has a Chinese website and sees 75% of its traffic coming from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Seven additional companies on the web list were developed in China but exported their AI tech globally: DeepSeek, Hailuo, Kling, SeaArt, Cutout Pro, Manus, and Monica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On mobile, 22 of the 50 top apps were developed in China, but only three were primarily used in China. Top players here include Meitu (Photo &amp;amp; Video Editor, BeautyPlus, BeautyCam, Wink, and Airbrush), ByteDance (Doubao and Cici), Gauth, and Hypic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vibe-coding startups Lovable and Replit both debuted on the main list this time, having not made the cut on a16z’s list published back in March of this year. (Note that websites built and published via Replit and via Lovable without custom domains appear under traffic for replit.app and lovable.app, respectively, helping them gain traction.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3040469" height="253" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Top-Gen-AI-Brink-List.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;a16z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Andreessen Horowitz also took time to call out AI apps that were on the brink of making the list of top AI apps, including PixAI, Bolt, Blackbox AI, Clipchamp, and Getliner on the web and Talkie, Seekee, Photo AI, AI Mirror, and Arvin on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm notes that the mobile list in this month’s report already features more newcomers (14) than before, as both app stores have long since cracked down on ChatGPT copycats and clones, allowing for more original apps to find their footing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;ChatGPT rivals like Google’s Gemini, xAI’s Grok, and, to a lesser extent, Meta AI, are closing the gap to ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular AI chatbot, according to a new report focused on the consumer AI landscape from venture firm Andreessen Horowitz.&lt;/p&gt;

But less than a year later, a conversation with one of his clients led him to a far more significant problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A nearby school’s carpool line was constantly blocking the parking lot of one of Aurelian’s hair salon clients. The salon owner called the city’s non-emergency line and was put on hold for 45 minutes before reaching a dispatcher. “She called me into her office afterwards, and was like, ‘Max, do you want to help me out?’” Keenan told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When he started to research how municipal non-emergency response call centers work, he discovered that they are often handled by the same people who are answering actual 911 emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aurelian pivoted to building an AI voice assistant that helps 911 call centers offload non-emergency call volume. The company announced on Wednesday that it raised a $14 million Series A led by NEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s AI voice agent is designed to triage non-urgent issues like noise complaints, parking violations, and even stolen wallet reports —  situations that don’t need an officer’s immediate response or can be handled without dispatching personnel to the scene. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aurelian’s AI is trained to recognize a real emergency and immediately transfer those calls to a human dispatcher, Keenan said. In other situations, the system collects key information and either creates a report for or relays the details directly to the police department for follow-up action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since launching its AI assistant in May 2024, Aurelian has been deployed at more than a dozen 911 dispatch centers, including those serving Snohomish County, Washington; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Kalamazoo, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emergency call centers are adopting Aurelian largely because they are consistently understaffed — a direct result of dispatching being a high-pressure job that ranks among the top 10 industries with the highest turnover rates. Emergency dispatchers are often asked to work overtime, with reports of 12- to 16-hour workdays in certain counties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The reason why we’re most focused on 911 is because it’s the industry that has this pain point most acutely,” Keenan said. “We think that these telecommunicators should have a chance of taking a break or go to the bathroom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mustafa Neemuchwala, a partner at NEA, said, “One of the things that blows my mind, you’re not replacing an existing human being; you’re replacing a person they wanted to hire but couldn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aurelian isn’t the only AI startup tackling non-emergency calls. Hyper, which raised a $6.3 million seed round, came out of stealth last month. Prepared, a company founded in 2019, also recently added an AI voice solution for emergency response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Aurelian believes its product is ahead of the competition. According to Neemuchwala, Aurelian is the only company actually deployed and handling live calls. “As far as we know, nobody else is actually live,” he said, referring to Aurelian responding to thousands of actual calls daily.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2216397171.jpg?resize=1200,633" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;When Max Keenan joined Y Combinator’s summer 2022 batch, he was working on Aurelian, a company that automated appointment bookings for hair salons. But less than a year later, a conversation with one of his clients led him to a far more significant problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A nearby school’s carpool line was constantly blocking the parking lot of one of Aurelian’s hair salon clients. The salon owner called the city’s non-emergency line and was put on hold for 45 minutes before reaching a dispatcher. “She called me into her office afterwards, and was like, ‘Max, do you want to help me out?’” Keenan told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When he started to research how municipal non-emergency response call centers work, he discovered that they are often handled by the same people who are answering actual 911 emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aurelian pivoted to building an AI voice assistant that helps 911 call centers offload non-emergency call volume. The company announced on Wednesday that it raised a $14 million Series A led by NEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s AI voice agent is designed to triage non-urgent issues like noise complaints, parking violations, and even stolen wallet reports —  situations that don’t need an officer’s immediate response or can be handled without dispatching personnel to the scene. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aurelian’s AI is trained to recognize a real emergency and immediately transfer those calls to a human dispatcher, Keenan said. In other situations, the system collects key information and either creates a report for or relays the details directly to the police department for follow-up action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since launching its AI assistant in May 2024, Aurelian has been deployed at more than a dozen 911 dispatch centers, including those serving Snohomish County, Washington; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Kalamazoo, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

That growth was largely fueled by AI-dominated data center business, which saw a 56% year-over-year increase in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia also saw its net income grow substantially since last year. The company reported a net income of $26.4 billion in the second quarter, a 59% spike since the same period last year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All told, the company brought in $41.1 billion in revenue from data center sales in the quarter, suggesting that AI companies’ demand for cutting-edge GPUs continues to grow. The company’s most advanced generation of chips, Blackwell, accounted for $27 billion of those sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for,” said CEO Jensen Huang in a statement accompanying the release. “The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Huang said that the company expects to see $3 to 4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. “$3 to 4 trillion is fairly sensible for the next five years,” he told one analyst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company made particular note of its role in the launch of OpenAI’s open source gpt-oss models earlier this month, which involved processing “1.5 million tokens per second on a single Nvidia Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack-scale system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The earnings also gave a look at Nvidia’s ongoing struggle to sell its chips in Chinese markets. The company reported no sales of its China-focused H20 chip to Chinese customers in the past quarter; Nvidia did report $650 million worth of H20 chips had been sold to a customer outside China.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The United States has long restricted sales of advanced GPUs to Chinese customers — but the geopolitical situation has changed significantly under President Trump. The company is now permitted to sell chips to China as long as it pays a 15% export tax to the U.S. Treasury, as a result of an unconventional arrangement that legal scholars have described as an unconstitutional abuse of power.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress made clear that the lack of shipment was a result of uncertainty around the arrangement, which has not been officially codified into a federal regulation. “While a select number of our China-based customers have received licenses over the past few weeks,” Kress said, “we have not shipped any H20 devices based on those licenses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the Chinese government has officially discouraged the use of Nvidia chips by local businesses, leading the company to reportedly halt production of the H20 chip earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia said it expects $54 billion in revenue in the third quarter. The company noted that its outlook for the third quarter, which could shift 2% in either direction, doesn’t include any H20 shipments to China.  &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2183848501.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, reported another quarter of sustained sales growth in its earnings statement Wednesday, with $46.7 billion in revenue, a&amp;nbsp;56% increase compared to the same period last year.

With Humans (NVIDIA Blog)</title><link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-reasoning-cosmos/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cosmos-reasoning-blog-header-1280x680-1.gif" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bsf-rt-reading-time"&gt;&lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-label"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-postfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI models are advancing at a rapid rate and scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what might they lack that (most) humans don’t? Common sense: an understanding, developed through real-world experiences, that birds can’t fly backwards, mirrors are reflective and ice melts into water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such principles seem obvious to humans, they must be taught to AI models tasked with accurately answering complex questions and navigating unpredictable physical environments, such as industrial warehouses or roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is tackling this challenge by developing a set of tests to coach AI models on the limitations of the physical world. In other words, to teach AI common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tests are used to develop reasoning models such as NVIDIA Cosmos Reason, an open reasoning vision language model (VLM) used for physical AI applications that are proficient in generating temporally grounded responses. Cosmos Reason just topped the physical reasoning leaderboard on Hugging Face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosmos Reason is unique compared with previous VLMs as it’s designed to accelerate physical AI development for fields such as robotics, autonomous vehicles and smart spaces. The model can infer and reason through unprecedented scenarios using physical common-sense knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For models to understand complex environments — including industrial spaces and laboratories — they must start small. For example, in the test depicted below, the Cosmos Reason model is tasked with answering a multiple-choice question about the relative motion in the video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example from Cosmos Reason evaluation dataset&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Does Reasoning Look Like for an AI Model?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To develop their reasoning capabilities, NVIDIA models are being taught physical common sense about the real world via reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, robots don’t intuitively know which way is left, right, up or down. They’re taught these spatial-temporal limitations through training. AI-powered robots used in safety testing, such as vehicle crash testing, must be taught to be aware of how their physical forms interact with their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without embedding common sense into the training of these robots, issues can arise in deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without basic knowledge about the physical world, a robot may fall down or accidentally break something, causing danger to the surrounding people and environment,” said Yin Cui, a Cosmos Reason research scientist at NVIDIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distilling human common sense about the physical world into models is how NVIDIA is bringing about the next generation of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the NVIDIA data factory team: a group of global analysts who come from various backgrounds — including bioengineering, business and linguistics. They’re working to develop, analyze and compile hundreds of thousands of data units that will be used to train generative AI models on how to reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Data Curation Process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the NVIDIA data factory team’s projects focuses on the development of world foundation models for physical AI applications. These virtual environments create deep learning neural networks that are safer and more effective for training reasoning models, based on simulated domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all starts with an NVIDIA annotation group that creates question-and-answer pairs based on video data. These videos are all from the real world and can include any type of footage, whether depicting chickens walking around in their coop or cars driving on a rural road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, an annotator might ask about the video below: “The person uses which hand to cut the spaghetti?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example from Cosmos Reason evaluation dataset&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annotators then come up with four multiple choice answers labeled A, B, C and D. The model is fed the data and has to reason and choose the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re basically coming up with a test for the model,” said Cui. “All of our questions are multiple choice, like what students would see on a school exam.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These question-and-answer pairs are then quality checked by NVIDIA analysts, such as Michelle Li.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li has a background in public health and data analytics, which allows her to look at the broader purpose of the data she analyzes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For physical AI, we have a specific goal of wanting to train models on understanding the physical world, which helps me think about the bigger picture when I’m looking at the Q&amp;amp;A pairs and the types of questions that are being presented,” Li said. “I ask myself, do the Q&amp;amp;A pairs that I’m looking at align with our objectives for the guidelines that we have for the project?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, the data is reviewed by the data factory leads of the project, who make sure it’s up to quality standards and ready to be sent to the Cosmos Reason research team. The scientists then feed the hundred thousands of data units — in this case the Q&amp;amp;A pairs — to the model, training it with reinforcement learning on the bounds and limitations of the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Are the Applications of Reasoning AI?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasoning models are exceptional because they can make sense of their temporal space as well as predict outcomes. They can analyze a situation, come up with a thought web of probable outcomes and infer the most likely scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, reasoning AI demonstrates humanlike thinking. It shows its work, giving the user insight into the logic behind its responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can ask these models to analyze a video such as of two cars driving on a road. When asked a question like, “What would happen if the cars were driving toward each other on the same lane?” the model can reason and determine the most probable outcome of the proposed scenario — for example, a car crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re building a pioneering reasoning model focused on physical AI,” said Tsung-Yi Lin, a principal research scientist on the Cosmos Reason team at NVIDIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data factory team’s ability to produce high-quality data will be imperative for driving the development of intelligent autonomous agents and physical AI systems that can safely interact with the real world as NVIDIA reasoning model innovation continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Preview &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVDIA Cosmos-Reason1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; or download the model on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;GitHub&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re building a pioneering reasoning model focused on physical AI,” said Tsung-Yi Lin, a principal research scientist on the Cosmos Reason team at NVIDIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data factory team’s ability to produce high-quality data will be imperative for driving the development of intelligent autonomous agents and physical AI systems that can safely interact with the real world as NVIDIA reasoning model innovation continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Preview &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVDIA Cosmos-Reason1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; or download the model on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;GitHub&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
