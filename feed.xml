&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI companies are clustering around healthcare and fast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In just the past week, OpenAI&amp;nbsp;bought health startup Torch, Anthropic launched&amp;nbsp;Claude for healthcare, and Sam Altman-backed&amp;nbsp;MergeLabs closed a $250 million seed round&amp;nbsp;at an $850 million valuation. The money and products are pouring into health&amp;nbsp;and voice AI, but so are concerns about hallucination risks, inaccurate medical information, and massive security vulnerabilities in systems handling sensitive patient data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Watch as&amp;nbsp;Equity&amp;nbsp;podcast hosts Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and Sean O’Kane dig into why&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;AI&amp;nbsp;world&amp;nbsp;is suddenly obsessed with health care, what other products can expect an AI-makeover, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The White House and the governors of several states in the region want grid operator PJM to hold an auction for 15-year contracts for new generating capacity. The administration said it wants tech companies to bid on the contracts even if they don’t ultimately need the power for their data centers. Demand from data centers is expected to increase nearly threefold over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PJM said it was reviewing the “statement of principles” and that it would soon release the results of a months-long planning process that is looking to add new capacity to the grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The statement is nonbonding, though, and behind the scenes, PJM doesn’t appear to be jazzed about the administration attempting to force its hand.&amp;nbsp;“We don’t have a lot to say on this,” PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields told Bloomberg yesterday. “We were not invited to the event they are apparently having tomorrow and we will not be there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PJM Interconnection, which covers 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, serves more than 65 million people and includes the data center hotspot of northern Virginia. Electricity rates in 2025 were up about 10% to 15% in the region compared with the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the last decade, PJM’s peak load has increased 10%, according to Monitoring Analytics, and it’s expected to increase another 6.5% in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Much of the blame has been laid at the feet of tech companies and data center operators, which have been using increasing amounts of power for AI.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The price of natural gas is also to blame. PJM is heavily dependent on the fossil fuel, and the price has soared recently. Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent monitor, says that about 60% of 2025’s price increases are the result of high prices for fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Grid operators have been put in a bind as data centers have ramped up demand for electricity after more than a decade of zero growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Building new fossil fuel power plants is a years-long proposition costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Many utilities and power providers are hesitant to commit to those timelines and outlays. If the AI boom fizzles, they could be left with unprofitable power plants that are built to operate for decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech companies, which haven’t traditionally been in the power business, have instead been turning to renewables, which are cheaper, more modular, and faster to deploy. Solar and batteries have been an early winner. A typical solar farm can be built in about 18 months, and because it can be built in phases, can start delivering power before it’s complete. That aligns more closely with data center construction, allowing companies to manage risk on similar timelines.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1453486183.jpeg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The Trump administration wants the largest electricity grid to add $15 billion worth of new power generation —&amp;nbsp;and he wants tech companies to pay for it, even if they don’t need the capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, there’s one surefire way to do that, and that is through advertising. In the near term, that seems to be the AI giant’s plan, as it announced this week that limited ads are headed to certain ChatGPT users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a blog post published Friday, OpenAI said that it will begin testing ads in the U.S. for both its free and Go tiers. (Go accounts, which cost $8 a month, were introduced globally on Friday.) The company frames this as a way to sustain free access while generating revenue from people who aren’t ready to commit to a paid subscription. For the time being, the company’s more expensive paid tiers — Pro, Plus, Business, and Enterprise — will not be getting any ads.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ads will appear at the bottom of a user’s conversation and will be targeted to the topic of discussion. Users will have some control over this situation, as they’ll be able to dismiss ads, see explanations for why they’re being shown particular ones, and also turn off personalization, which should defeat the ads’ targeted nature. The company has also made a commitment not to serve ads to users it believes are under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3083447" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch (Screenshot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that ChatGPT will maintain “answer independence,” meaning that, despite the incorporation of advertising, those ads will not influence the answers that the chatbot serves to users. The company has also promised not to sell users’ data to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This strategy could pay off in two ways. For users of the free and Go tiers, the company obviously stands to make a significant amount of ad revenue. At the same time, there will necessarily be certain users who appreciate the app but don’t appreciate the ads, which could conceivably drive an uptick in subscriptions to the platform’s more expensive accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also wants everybody to know that it’s only sticking ads in its chatbot to help the world. In its blog post Friday, the company promised that its “pursuit of advertising is always in support of” its mission: that AGI “benefits all of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

Traditional techniques, like high-throughput screening, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company completed its Series B, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a deal in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of&amp;nbsp;“computer-aided design suite” for molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia on a $1 billion partnership to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The industry isn’t without its detractors. Some industry veterans seem to feel that — given how difficult traditional drug development is — these new technologies are unlikely to have a major impact. However, for every naysayer, there seem to be just as many believers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elena Viboch, managing director at General Catalyst — one of Chai’s major backers — told TechCrunch that her firm is confident that companies that adopt the startup’s services will see results. “We believe the biopharma companies that move the most quickly to partner with companies like Chai will be the first to get molecules into the clinic, and will make medicines that matter,” Viboch said. “In practice that means partnering in 2026 and by the end of 2027 seeing first-in-class medicines enter into clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aliza Apple, the head of Lilly’s TuneLab program — which uses AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery — also expressed confidence in Chai’s product. “By combining Chai’s generative design models with Lilly’s deep biologics expertise and proprietary data, we intend to push the frontier of how AI can design better molecules from the outset, with the ultimate goal to help accelerate the development of innovative medicines for patients,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chai may have been founded less than two years ago, but the startup’s origins began around six years ago, amid conversations between its co-founders and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. One of those founders, Josh Meier, previously worked for OpenAI in 2018 on its research and engineering team. After he left the company, Altman messaged Meier’s old college friend, Jack Dent, to ask about a potential business opportunity. Meier and Dent had originally met in computer science classes at Harvard but, at the time, Dent was a Stripe engineer (another company Altman was an early backer of). Altman asked him if he thought Meier would be open to collaborating on a proteomics startup — that is, a company focused on the study of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman “messaged me to say that everyone at OpenAI thought highly of him and asked if I thought he’d be open to working with them on a proteomics spinout,” Dent said. Dent told Altman “of course,” but there was just one hitch: Meier didn’t feel like the technology was quite “there” yet. The AI tech behind such firms — which leverage powerful algorithms — was still a growing field and far from where it needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meier was also pretty dead set on joining Facebook’s research and engineering team, which is what he would go on to do. At Facebook, Meier helped to develop ESM1, the first transformer protein-language model — an important precursor to the work Chai is currently doing. After Meier’s time at Facebook, he would spend three years at Absci, another AI biotech firm based around drug creation.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By 2024, Meier and Dent finally felt prepared to tackle the proteomics company they had originally discussed with Altman. “Josh and I reached back out to Sam and told him we should pick up that conversation where&amp;nbsp;we left off — and that we were starting Chai together,” Dent said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI ended up becoming one of Chai’s first seed investors. Meier and Dent actually founded Chai — along with their co-founders, Matthew McPartlon and Jacques Boitreaud — while working out of the AI giant’s offices in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. “They were kind enough to give us some office space,” Dent revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, a little over a year later, as Chai basks in the glow of its newfound partnership with Eli Lilly, Dent says that the key to the company’s fast growth has been assembling a team of hugely talented people. “We really just put our heads down and pushed the frontier of what these models are capable of,” said Dent. “Every line of code in our codebase is homegrown. We’re not taking LLMs off the shelf that are in the open source [ecosystem] and fine-tuning them. These are highly custom architectures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;General Catalyst’s Viboch told TechCrunch that she felt Chai was ready to hit the ground running. “There are no fundamental barriers to deployment of these models in drug discovery,” she said. “Companies will still need to take drug candidates through testing and clinical trials, but we believe there’ll be significant advantages to those who adopt these technologies — not just in compressing discovery timelines, but also in unlocking classes of medicines that have historically been difficult to develop.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/251201-ChaiDiscovery-group-5263.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Drug discovery, the art of identifying new molecules to develop pharmaceuticals, is a notoriously time-consuming and difficult process. Traditional techniques, like high-throughput screening, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company completed its Series B, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a deal in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of&amp;nbsp;“computer-aided design suite” for molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia on a $1 billion partnership to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The industry isn’t without its detractors. Some industry veterans seem to feel that — given how difficult traditional drug development is — these new technologies are unlikely to have a major impact. However, for every naysayer, there seem to be just as many believers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elena Viboch, managing director at General Catalyst — one of Chai’s major backers — told TechCrunch that her firm is confident that companies that adopt the startup’s services will see results. “We believe the biopharma companies that move the most quickly to partner with companies like Chai will be the first to get molecules into the clinic, and will make medicines that matter,” Viboch said. “In practice that means partnering in 2026 and by the end of 2027 seeing first-in-class medicines enter into clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aliza Apple, the head of Lilly’s TuneLab program — which uses AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery — also expressed confidence in Chai’s product. “By combining Chai’s generative design models with Lilly’s deep biologics expertise and proprietary data, we intend to push the frontier of how AI can design better molecules from the outset, with the ultimate goal to help accelerate the development of innovative medicines for patients,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chai may have been founded less than two years ago, but the startup’s origins began around six years ago, amid conversations between its co-founders and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. One of those founders, Josh Meier, previously worked for OpenAI in 2018 on its research and engineering team. After he left the company, Altman messaged Meier’s old college friend, Jack Dent, to ask about a potential business opportunity. Meier and Dent had originally met in computer science classes at Harvard but, at the time, Dent was a Stripe engineer (another company Altman was an early backer of). Altman asked him if he thought Meier would be open to collaborating on a proteomics startup — that is, a company focused on the study of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman “messaged me to say that everyone at OpenAI thought highly of him and asked if I thought he’d be open to working with them on a proteomics spinout,” Dent said. Dent told Altman “of course,” but there was just one hitch: Meier didn’t feel like the technology was quite “there” yet. The AI tech behind such firms — which leverage powerful algorithms — was still a growing field and far from where it needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meier was also pretty dead set on joining Facebook’s research and engineering team, which is what he would go on to do. At Facebook, Meier helped to develop ESM1, the first transformer protein-language model — an important precursor to the work Chai is currently doing. After Meier’s time at Facebook, he would spend three years at Absci, another AI biotech firm based around drug creation.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By 2024, Meier and Dent finally felt prepared to tackle the proteomics company they had originally discussed with Altman. “Josh and I reached back out to Sam and told him we should pick up that conversation where&amp;nbsp;we left off — and that we were starting Chai together,” Dent said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI ended up becoming one of Chai’s first seed investors. Meier and Dent actually founded Chai — along with their co-founders, Matthew McPartlon and Jacques Boitreaud — while working out of the AI giant’s offices in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. “They were kind enough to give us some office space,” Dent revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, a little over a year later, as Chai basks in the glow of its newfound partnership with Eli Lilly, Dent says that the key to the company’s fast growth has been assembling a team of hugely talented people. “We really just put our heads down and pushed the frontier of what these models are capable of,” said Dent. “Every line of code in our codebase is homegrown.

          &lt;p&gt;On Friday, OpenAI announced it will begin testing advertisements inside the ChatGPT app for some US users in a bid to expand its customer base and diversify revenue. The move represents a reversal for CEO Sam Altman, who in 2024 described advertising in ChatGPT as a “last resort” and expressed concerns that ads could erode user trust, although he did not completely rule out the possibility at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banner ads will appear in the coming weeks for logged-in users of the free version of ChatGPT as well as the new $8 per month ChatGPT Go plan, which OpenAI also announced Friday is now available worldwide. OpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India in August 2025 and has since rolled it out to over 170 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users paying for the more expensive Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to OpenAI’s blog post, the company plans to test ads “at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service.” Ads will be labeled and separated from the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In example screenshots shared by the company, the ads look like blocked off sections of the chat window with a small image and some advertising copy. Asking ChatGPT for places to visit in Mexico could result in holiday ads appearing, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in the blog post. “We believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s announcement follows the company’s April 2025 introduction of shopping features to ChatGPT Search. At that time, OpenAI’s Adam Fry told Wired that product recommendations were “not ads” and “not sponsored,” but it felt like a potential step in that direction at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is not the only AI company exploring advertising revenue. Google began testing AdSense ads in chatbot experiences through partnerships with AI startups in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Financial pressures and a changing tune&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s advertising experiment reflects the enormous financial pressures facing the company. OpenAI does not expect to be profitable until 2030 and has committed to spend about $1.4 trillion on massive data centers and chips for AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to financial documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal in November, OpenAI expects to burn through roughly $9 billion this year while generating $13 billion in revenue. Only about 5 percent of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly users pay for subscriptions, so it’s not enough to cover all of OpenAI’s operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is convinced ads will solve OpenAI’s financial problems. “I am extremely bearish on this ads product,” tech critic Ed Zitron wrote on Bluesky. “Even if this becomes a good business line, OpenAI’s services cost too much for it to matter!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s embrace of ads appears to come reluctantly, since it runs counter to a “personal bias” against advertising that Altman has shared in earlier public statements. For example, during a fireside chat at Harvard University in 2024, Altman said he found the combination of ads and AI “uniquely unsettling,” implying that he would not like it if the chatbot itself changed its responses due to advertising pressure. He added: “When I think of like GPT writing me a response, if I had to go figure out exactly how much was who paying here to influence what I’m being shown, I don’t think I would like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2136120 align-center"&gt;

              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, OpenAI’s approach appears to be a compromise between needing ad revenue and not wanting sponsored content to appear directly within ChatGPT’s written responses. By placing banner ads at the bottom of answers separated from the conversation history, OpenAI appears to be addressing Altman’s concern: The AI assistant’s actual output, the company says, will remain uninfluenced by advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Simo wrote in a blog post that OpenAI’s ads will not influence ChatGPT’s conversational responses and that the company will not share conversations with advertisers and will not show ads on sensitive topics such as mental health and politics to users it determines to be under 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” Simo wrote. “That means you need to trust that ChatGPT’s responses are driven by what’s objectively useful, never by advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Friday, OpenAI announced it will begin testing advertisements inside the ChatGPT app for some US users in a bid to expand its customer base and diversify revenue. The move represents a reversal for CEO Sam Altman, who in 2024 described advertising in ChatGPT as a “last resort” and expressed concerns that ads could erode user trust, although he did not completely rule out the possibility at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banner ads will appear in the coming weeks for logged-in users of the free version of ChatGPT as well as the new $8 per month ChatGPT Go plan, which OpenAI also announced Friday is now available worldwide. OpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India in August 2025 and has since rolled it out to over 170 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users paying for the more expensive Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to OpenAI’s blog post, the company plans to test ads “at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service.” Ads will be labeled and separated from the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In example screenshots shared by the company, the ads look like blocked off sections of the chat window with a small image and some advertising copy. Asking ChatGPT for places to visit in Mexico could result in holiday ads appearing, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in the blog post. “We believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s announcement follows the company’s April 2025 introduction of shopping features to ChatGPT Search. At that time, OpenAI’s Adam Fry told Wired that product recommendations were “not ads” and “not sponsored,” but it felt like a potential step in that direction at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is not the only AI company exploring advertising revenue. Google began testing AdSense ads in chatbot experiences through partnerships with AI startups in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Financial pressures and a changing tune&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s advertising experiment reflects the enormous financial pressures facing the company. OpenAI does not expect to be profitable until 2030 and has committed to spend about $1.4 trillion on massive data centers and chips for AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to financial documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal in November, OpenAI expects to burn through roughly $9 billion this year while generating $13 billion in revenue. Only about 5 percent of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly users pay for subscriptions, so it’s not enough to cover all of OpenAI’s operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is convinced ads will solve OpenAI’s financial problems. “I am extremely bearish on this ads product,” tech critic Ed Zitron wrote on Bluesky. “Even if this becomes a good business line, OpenAI’s services cost too much for it to matter!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s embrace of ads appears to come reluctantly, since it runs counter to a “personal bias” against advertising that Altman has shared in earlier public statements. For example, during a fireside chat at Harvard University in 2024, Altman said he found the combination of ads and AI “uniquely unsettling,” implying that he would not like it if the chatbot itself changed its responses due to advertising pressure. He added: “When I think of like GPT writing me a response, if I had to go figure out exactly how much was who paying here to influence what I’m being shown, I don’t think I would like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2136120 align-center"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, OpenAI’s approach appears to be a compromise between needing ad revenue and not wanting sponsored content to appear directly within ChatGPT’s written responses. By placing banner ads at the bottom of answers separated from the conversation history, OpenAI appears to be addressing Altman’s concern: The AI assistant’s actual output, the company says, will remain uninfluenced by advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Simo wrote in a blog post that OpenAI’s ads will not influence ChatGPT’s conversational responses and that the company will not share conversations with advertisers and will not show ads on sensitive topics such as mental health and politics to users it determines to be under 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” Simo wrote. “That means you need to trust that ChatGPT’s responses are driven by what’s objectively useful, never by advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;

On Friday, the government followed up by sending a cease-and-desist letter to the company, demanding that it take immediate action to stop the production of nonconsensual intimate images and CSAM — child sexual abuse material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Today, I sent xAI a cease-and-desist letter, demanding the company immediately&amp;nbsp;stop the creation and distribution of deepfake, nonconsensual, intimate images and child sexual abuse material,” said California AG Rob Bonta in a press release. “The creation of this material is illegal. I fully expect xAI to immediately comply. California has zero tolerance for [CSAM].”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AG’s office additionally claimed that xAI appeared to be “facilitating the large-scale production” of nonconsensual nudes, the likes of which are being “used to harass women and girls across the internet.” The agency said it expects xAI to prove that it is taking steps to address these issues within the next five days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the heart of the backlash is Grok’s “spicy” mode feature, which xAI created to generate explicit content. The issue has spread beyond California; Japan, Canada, and Britain have opened investigations into Grok, and Malaysia and Indonesia have temporarily blocked the platform altogether. Despite xAI instituting some restrictions on its image-editing features late Wednesday, the California AG’s office moved ahead with its cease-and-desist letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;X’s safety account has previously denounced this kind of user activity, saying: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” TechCrunch reached out to xAI for comment and was met with an automated email that says “Legacy Media Lies.” TC also reached out to the California AG’s office for more context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The advent of free generative AI tools has led to a disturbing swell of non-consensual sexual material. Many platforms have been grappling with this problem, not just X. The sordid activity has drawn the attention not just of state leaders but also of Congress.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Their startup journey is a wild example of how if you build it well and the timing is lucky, they will definitely come.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The story includes bootstrapping their way to over $1 million in revenue; landing a $20 million seed round after VC Radhika Malik, a partner at Dell Technologies Capital, saw some Reddit posts; and gaining another key angel investor, Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond, because he was using the product and reached out over the support chat, the founders tell TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It all began in late 2021 when the two friends, who worked together as corporate developers for Comcast, decided the hobby they were doing wasn’t fun anymore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They had built setups of specialized computers used to generate Ethereum in their respective New Jersey basements. While they did successfully mine a bit of the cryptocurrency, it wasn’t enough to pay back their investment, they said. Plus, mining was going to end after the much-ballyhooed network upgrade called “The Merge.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On top of that, it was “boring” after a couple of months, Lu said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But they had talked their wives into letting them spend a good $50,000 on the hobby between them, they estimated. Lu and Singh knew that home harmony depended on finding a way to use those GPUs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;

													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 13-15, 2026&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The devs had been engaged in machine learning projects at work, so they opted to convert their mining rigs into AI servers. This was before ChatGPT, even before DALL-E 2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As they repurposed the rigs, “We were seeing how really god-awful the software stack was for dealing with these GPUs,” Lu said. As developers, they found a problem they wanted to solve.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Runpod was born “because we felt that the actual experience of developing software on top of GPUs was just hot garbage,” Lu described.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A few months later in early 2022, they were ready to share what they had built. Runpod is a platform for hosting AI apps, emphasizing speed, easily configured hardware (including a serverless option that automates configuration), and dev tools like APIs, command-line interfaces, and other integrations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Back in 2021, they only had a few such integrations (like support for popular web app tool Jupyter notebooks). The next problem: finding beta testers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As first-time founders, we didn’t really know how to market or how to do anything,” Lu recalled. “So I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So, they posted in a couple of AI-oriented subreddits. The offer was simple: free access to their AI servers in exchange for feedback. It worked. They landed beta customers, which led to paying customers. Within nine months, they had quit their jobs and hit $1 million in revenue, they said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bootstrapping-growth"&gt;Bootstrapping growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But that led to another problem. “Six months in, business users were like, ‘Hey, I want to actually run real business stuff on your platform. But I cannot run it on servers that are in people’s basements,” Lu said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It had not occurred to the New Jersey founders to raise capital from VCs. Instead they&amp;nbsp;formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to grow capacity. But it was stressful. The founders needed to stay three steps ahead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If we don’t have the GPUs, the market sentiment, the user sentiment changes. Because when they don’t see capacity from you, they go somewhere else,” Singh described.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, their user base was growing on Reddit and Discord, especially after ChatGPT launched.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;VCs were also on the prowl for investments.&amp;nbsp;Malik saw them on Reddit and reached out, their first VC call. But Lu didn’t know how to pitch to an investor. “Radhika was super helpful, even at the first conversation,” he said. She basically explained to him how a VC thinks and told him she’d stay in touch.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Lu had a business to run that had to pay for itself. “It was almost two years where we really didn’t have any funding,” he said. So Runpod never offered a free tier. It had to at least pay for itself, even if it wasn’t throwing off much profit. Unlike other AI cloud services that began as crypto miners, these founders refused to take on debt, they said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By May 2024, with AI app fever spreading, their lucky decision to launch AI hosting for devs two years earlier was paying off. Their business had grown to 100,000 developers, and they landed a $20 million seed deal co-led by the VC arms of both Dell and Intel, with participation from big names like Nat Friedman and Chaumond.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They haven’t raised more money since but are now planning to, armed with a business that, they believe, should command a healthy Series A.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, Runpod counts 500,000 developers as customers, ranging from individuals to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multimillion-dollar annual spend, the founders said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Their cloud spans 31 regions globally and counts customers like Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow as users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Competition is also fierce. Devs have all the major clouds to choose from (AWS, Microsoft, Google), plus plenty of industry-specific choices like CoreWeave and Core Scientific.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But they also see their place in the world a bit differently — as a dev-centric platform. They don’t see coding ever going away but changing. Programmers will become AI agent creators and operators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our goal is to be what this next generation of software developers grows up on,” Lu said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Runpod-founders-Zhen-Lu-Pardeep-Singh.png?w=981" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Runpod, an AI app hosting platform that launched four years ago, has hit a $120 million annual revenue run rate, founders Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh tell TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Their startup journey is a wild example of how if you build it well and the timing is lucky, they will definitely come.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The story includes bootstrapping their way to over $1 million in revenue; landing a $20 million seed round after VC Radhika Malik, a partner at Dell Technologies Capital, saw some Reddit posts; and gaining another key angel investor, Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond, because he was using the product and reached out over the support chat, the founders tell TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It all began in late 2021 when the two friends, who worked together as corporate developers for Comcast, decided the hobby they were doing wasn’t fun anymore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They had built setups of specialized computers used to generate Ethereum in their respective New Jersey basements. While they did successfully mine a bit of the cryptocurrency, it wasn’t enough to pay back their investment, they said. Plus, mining was going to end after the much-ballyhooed network upgrade called “The Merge.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On top of that, it was “boring” after a couple of months, Lu said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But they had talked their wives into letting them spend a good $50,000 on the hobby between them, they estimated. Lu and Singh knew that home harmony depended on finding a way to use those GPUs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 13-15, 2026&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The devs had been engaged in machine learning projects at work, so they opted to convert their mining rigs into AI servers. This was before ChatGPT, even before DALL-E 2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As they repurposed the rigs, “We were seeing how really god-awful the software stack was for dealing with these GPUs,” Lu said. As developers, they found a problem they wanted to solve.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Runpod was born “because we felt that the actual experience of developing software on top of GPUs was just hot garbage,” Lu described.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A few months later in early 2022, they were ready to share what they had built. Runpod is a platform for hosting AI apps, emphasizing speed, easily configured hardware (including a serverless option that automates configuration), and dev tools like APIs, command-line interfaces, and other integrations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Back in 2021, they only had a few such integrations (like support for popular web app tool Jupyter notebooks). The next problem: finding beta testers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As first-time founders, we didn’t really know how to market or how to do anything,” Lu recalled. “So I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So, they posted in a couple of AI-oriented subreddits. The offer was simple: free access to their AI servers in exchange for feedback. It worked. They landed beta customers, which led to paying customers. Within nine months, they had quit their jobs and hit $1 million in revenue, they said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bootstrapping-growth"&gt;Bootstrapping growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But that led to another problem. “Six months in, business users were like, ‘Hey, I want to actually run real business stuff on your platform. But I cannot run it on servers that are in people’s basements,” Lu said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It had not occurred to the New Jersey founders to raise capital from VCs. Instead they&amp;nbsp;formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to grow capacity. But it was stressful. The founders needed to stay three steps ahead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If we don’t have the GPUs, the market sentiment, the user sentiment changes. Because when they don’t see capacity from you, they go somewhere else,” Singh described.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, their user base was growing on Reddit and Discord, especially after ChatGPT launched.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;VCs were also on the prowl for investments.&amp;nbsp;Malik saw them on Reddit and reached out, their first VC call. But Lu didn’t know how to pitch to an investor. “Radhika was super helpful, even at the first conversation,” he said. She basically explained to him how a VC thinks and told him she’d stay in touch.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Lu had a business to run that had to pay for itself. “It was almost two years where we really didn’t have any funding,” he said. So Runpod never offered a free tier. It had to at least pay for itself, even if it wasn’t throwing off much profit. Unlike other AI cloud services that began as crypto miners, these founders refused to take on debt, they said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By May 2024, with AI app fever spreading, their lucky decision to launch AI hosting for devs two years earlier was paying off. Their business had grown to 100,000 developers, and they landed a $20 million seed deal co-led by the VC arms of both Dell and Intel, with participation from big names like Nat Friedman and Chaumond.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They haven’t raised more money since but are now planning to, armed with a business that, they believe, should command a healthy Series A.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, Runpod counts 500,000 developers as customers, ranging from individuals to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multimillion-dollar annual spend, the founders said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Their cloud spans 31 regions globally and counts customers like Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow as users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Competition is also fierce. Devs have all the major clouds to choose from (AWS, Microsoft, Google), plus plenty of industry-specific choices like CoreWeave and Core Scientific.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But they also see their place in the world a bit differently — as a dev-centric platform. They don’t see coding ever going away but changing. Programmers will become AI agent creators and operators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
