Operating on a freemium model, the product is geared toward both professional and hobbyist musicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We hope to make playing music more enjoyable,” Andrew Carlins, CEO of Songscription and a student in Stanford’s MBA/MA in Education program, told TechCrunch. “We imagine a future where a rural Nebraska high school band teacher [will be] able to get sheet music for the songs their students want to play, [and] that said music will be arranged specifically for the instruments in the band and offered at the individual level of play of each student.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At launch, Songscription can transcribe music for several different instruments, though the piano model is most reliable. In the future, the company hopes to add different transcription outputs (e.g., guitar tabs), as well as arrangements for a full band as opposed to just one instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This kind of product could be useful for a musician who records a song they’re working on, then uploads it to get the sheet music — that way, they can skip the step of having to manually transcribe their work. And for those who can’t read and write sheet music, Songscription will also generate a piano roll, which shows a digital representation of the music being played on a virtual piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can also automate music transcription directly from YouTube links. Uploading a file requires users to check a box to confirm that they have the rights to transcribe the file, but it would be easy to simply check the box and get free sheet music for copyrighted songs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“For music learners&amp;nbsp;… since you are allowed to listen to a song, write down the notes by ear, and perform it on your home piano (as long as you don’t charge for a performance), it isn’t fully clear that using a tech-enabled platform to give you a head start crosses any legal boundary, although we understand the field is evolving and our application may enter a gray area,” Carlins said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The legality around much of how we engage with these creative AI tools is up for debate, though recent court decisions seem to be favoring tech companies over artists. However, Songscription isn’t creating new, AI-generated music — it’s providing a tool for musicians to speed up the process of making their own guitar tabs or sheet music. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Since our platform allows users to edit the scores, we position ourselves as an augmented music notation software that helps people speed up the process of transcription,” Carlins said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The underlying architecture of Songscription’s AI model is based on a paper that co-founder Tim Beyer published, alongside researcher Angela Dai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In order to get the training data necessary for creating this kind of AI model, Songscription works with some musicians who were willing to share or sell their piano performances and sheet music. The company also used public domain sheet music, though the majority of the training data is synthetic, Carlins said. In that case, Songscription would convert the sheet music into audio, then alter the files to simulate real-world conditions with background noise or reverb. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just seven months after it was founded, Songscription has raised pre-seed money from Reach Capital and will participate in Stanford’s StartX accelerator. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1480808838.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A small company called Songscription launched last week with AI models that automate music transcription, turning an audio file of a song into sheet music within minutes.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The iPhone maker continues to build out a project internally dubbed “LLM Siri” that uses in-house AI models, according to Bloomberg. However, Apple has reportedly asked OpenAI and Anthropic to train versions of their AI models that can run on Apple’s cloud infrastructure for testing.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple was forced to delay its AI-enabled Siri, originally slated for 2025, until 2026 or later due to a series of technical challenges the company reportedly ran into. This failure may have been a long time coming; Apple has been falling behind Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic in the AI race for the last several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Siri can already call on ChatGPT for difficult questions, Apple now seems to be exploring a much deeper integration with technology from third-party AI providers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WWDC-2024-Apple-Intelligence-iPhone-Limits.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Apple is considering using AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power its updated version of Siri, rather than using technology the company has built in-house, according to a report from Bloomberg on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Making art used to be a uniquely human endeavor, but machines have learned to distill human creativity with generative AI. Whether that content counts as "art" depends on who you ask, but Spotify doesn't discriminate. A new band called The Velvet Sundown debuted on Spotify this month and has already amassed more than half a million listeners. But by all appearances, The Velvet Sundown is not a real band—it's AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many artists are vehemently opposed to using AI, some have leaned into the trend to assist with music production. However, it doesn't seem like there's an artist behind this group. In less than a month, The Velvet Sundown has released two albums on Spotify, titled "Floating On Echoes" and "Dust and Silence." A third album is releasing in two weeks. The tracks have a classic rock vibe with a cacophony of echoey instruments and a dash of autotune. If one of these songs came up in a mix, you might not notice anything is amiss. Listen to one after another, though, and the bland muddiness exposes them as a machine creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some listeners began to have doubts about The Velvet Sundown's existence over the past week, with multiple Reddit and X threads pointing out the lack of verifiable information on the band. The bio lists four members, none of whom appear to exist outside of The Velvet Sundown's album listings and social media. The group's songs have been mysteriously added to a large number of user-created playlists, which has helped swell its listener base in a few short weeks. When Spotify users began noticing The Velvet Sundown's apparent use of AI, the profile had around 300,000 listeners. It's now over 500,000 in less than a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When The Velvet Sundown set up an Instagram account on June 27, all doubts were laid to rest—these "people" are obviously AI. We may be past the era of being able to identify AI by counting fingers, but there are plenty of weird inconsistencies in these pics. In one Instagram post, the band claims to have gotten burgers to celebrate the success of the first two albums, but there are too many burgers and too few plates, and the food and drink are placed seemingly at random around the table. The band members themselves also have that unrealistically smooth and symmetrical look we see in AI-generated images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Velvet Sundown is not the only AI-generated act to invade streaming services. In a recent episode of Last Week Tonight focused on AI, host John Oliver highlighted an AI band called The Devil Inside that has released 10 albums in the past two years. Interestingly, both The Velvet Sundown and The Devil Inside seem to have many songs that reference dust and wind. That may simply be an artifact of repetition in music-generation models, or they may both be products of the same AI slop manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Labeling AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify is happy to accept AI music and does not require listings to reveal if a song was created entirely by a machine. The Velvet Sundown is also available on other streaming platforms, including Deezer, which takes a harder line on AI. According to NME, the band's bio on Deezer includes a disclaimer that "Some tracks on this album may have been created using artificial intelligence." NME also notes that the Spotify bio previously attributed a flattering description of the band's music to Billboard. The flattery remains, but Billboard's name has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the band's Instagram is flooded with comments calling out the use of AI, but the day may come when it's not so easy to tell. There's nothing inherently wrong with someone wanting to listen to an AI-generated song—there are a ton of YouTube channels that stream essentially infinite AI music. It's interesting technology, and the output has come a long way since the original Google MusicLM and OpenAI Jukebox models debuted a few years back. But people should know what is and is not AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art created by living, breathing people says something about the world—it's a manifestation of the human condition. The machinations of a machine, however, don't really matter in the same way. An AI-generated song might have a nice vibe, but it's just a remix of actual art assembled by a randomized algorithm. Google and others are endeavoring to create verifiable watermarks for AI images, but we may need something similar for audio if the largest music streamers continue to allow AI songs without disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Making art used to be a uniquely human endeavor, but machines have learned to distill human creativity with generative AI. Whether that content counts as "art" depends on who you ask, but Spotify doesn't discriminate. A new band called The Velvet Sundown debuted on Spotify this month and has already amassed more than half a million listeners. But by all appearances, The Velvet Sundown is not a real band—it's AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many artists are vehemently opposed to using AI, some have leaned into the trend to assist with music production. However, it doesn't seem like there's an artist behind this group. In less than a month, The Velvet Sundown has released two albums on Spotify, titled "Floating On Echoes" and "Dust and Silence." A third album is releasing in two weeks. The tracks have a classic rock vibe with a cacophony of echoey instruments and a dash of autotune. If one of these songs came up in a mix, you might not notice anything is amiss. Listen to one after another, though, and the bland muddiness exposes them as a machine creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some listeners began to have doubts about The Velvet Sundown's existence over the past week, with multiple Reddit and X threads pointing out the lack of verifiable information on the band. The bio lists four members, none of whom appear to exist outside of The Velvet Sundown's album listings and social media. The group's songs have been mysteriously added to a large number of user-created playlists, which has helped swell its listener base in a few short weeks. When Spotify users began noticing The Velvet Sundown's apparent use of AI, the profile had around 300,000 listeners. It's now over 500,000 in less than a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When The Velvet Sundown set up an Instagram account on June 27, all doubts were laid to rest—these "people" are obviously AI. We may be past the era of being able to identify AI by counting fingers, but there are plenty of weird inconsistencies in these pics. In one Instagram post, the band claims to have gotten burgers to celebrate the success of the first two albums, but there are too many burgers and too few plates, and the food and drink are placed seemingly at random around the table. The band members themselves also have that unrealistically smooth and symmetrical look we see in AI-generated images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Velvet Sundown is not the only AI-generated act to invade streaming services. In a recent episode of Last Week Tonight focused on AI, host John Oliver highlighted an AI band called The Devil Inside that has released 10 albums in the past two years. Interestingly, both The Velvet Sundown and The Devil Inside seem to have many songs that reference dust and wind. That may simply be an artifact of repetition in music-generation models, or they may both be products of the same AI slop manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Labeling AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify is happy to accept AI music and does not require listings to reveal if a song was created entirely by a machine. The Velvet Sundown is also available on other streaming platforms, including Deezer, which takes a harder line on AI. According to NME, the band's bio on Deezer includes a disclaimer that "Some tracks on this album may have been created using artificial intelligence." NME also notes that the Spotify bio previously attributed a flattering description of the band's music to Billboard. The flattery remains, but Billboard's name has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the band's Instagram is flooded with comments calling out the use of AI, but the day may come when it's not so easy to tell. There's nothing inherently wrong with someone wanting to listen to an AI-generated song—there are a ton of YouTube channels that stream essentially infinite AI music. It's interesting technology, and the output has come a long way since the original Google MusicLM and OpenAI Jukebox models debuted a few years back. But people should know what is and is not AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art created by living, breathing people says something about the world—it's a manifestation of the human condition. The machinations of a machine, however, don't really matter in the same way. An AI-generated song might have a nice vibe, but it's just a remix of actual art assembled by a randomized algorithm. Google and others are endeavoring to create verifiable watermarks for AI images, but we may need something similar for audio if the largest music streamers continue to allow AI songs without disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott White still marvels at how quickly artificial intelligence has transformed from a novelty into a true work partner. Just over a year ago, the product lead for Claude AI at Anthropic watched as early AI coding tools could barely complete a single line of code. Today, he’s building production-ready software features himself — despite not being a professional programmer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I no longer think about my job as writing a PRD and trying to convince someone to do something,” White said during a fireside chat at &lt;strong&gt;VB Transform 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, VentureBeat’s annual enterprise AI summit in San Francisco. “The first thing I do is, can I build a workable prototype of this on our staging server and then share a demo of it actually working.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This shift represents a broader transformation in how enterprises are adopting AI, moving beyond simple chatbots that answer questions to sophisticated “agentic” systems capable of autonomous work. White’s experience offers a glimpse into what may be coming for millions of other knowledge workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-code-completion-to-autonomous-programming-ai-s-breakneck-evolution"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From code completion to autonomous programming: AI’s breakneck evolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The evolution has been remarkably swift. When White joined Anthropic, the company’s Claude 2 model could handle basic text completion. The release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet enabled the creation of entire applications, leading to features like Artifacts that let users generate custom interfaces. Now, with Claude 4 achieving a 72.5% score on the SWE-bench coding benchmark, the model can function as what White calls “a fully remote agentic software engineer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Claude Code, the company’s latest coding tool, can analyze entire codebases, search the internet for API documentation, issue pull requests, respond to code review comments, and iterate on solutions — all while working asynchronously for hours. White noted that 90% of Claude Code itself was written by the AI system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That is like an entire agentic process in the background that was not possible six months ago,” White explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-giants-slash-work-time-from-weeks-to-minutes-with-ai-agents"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise giants slash work time from weeks to minutes with AI agents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications extend far beyond software development. Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical giant, has integrated Claude into workflows that previously took 10 weeks to complete clinical reports, now finishing the same work in 10 minutes. GitLab uses the technology for everything from sales proposals to technical documentation. Intuit deploys Claude to provide tax advice directly to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;White distinguishes between different levels of AI integration: simple language models that answer questions, models enhanced with tools like web search, structured workflows that incorporate AI into business processes, and full agents that can pursue goals autonomously using multiple tools and iterative reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think about an agent as something that has a goal, and then it can just do many things to accomplish that goal,” White said. The key enabler has been what he calls the “inexorable” relationship between model intelligence and new product capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-infrastructure-revolution-building-networks-of-ai-collaborators"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The infrastructure revolution: Building networks of AI collaborators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A critical infrastructure development has been Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), which White describes as “the USB-C for integrations.” Rather than companies building separate connections to each data source or tool, MCP provides a standardized way for AI systems to access enterprise software, from Salesforce to internal knowledge repositories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s really democratizing access to data,” White said, noting that integrations built by one company can be shared and reused by others through the open-source protocol.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For organizations looking to implement AI agents, White recommends starting small and building incrementally. “Don’t try to build an entire agentic system from scratch,” he advised. “Build the component of it, make sure that component works, then build a next component.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also emphasized the importance of evaluation systems to ensure AI agents perform as intended. “Evals are the new PRD,” White said, referring to product requirement documents, highlighting how companies must develop new methods to assess AI performance on specific business tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-ai-assistants-to-ai-organizations-the-next-workforce-frontier"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From AI assistants to AI organizations: The next workforce frontier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, White envisions AI development becoming accessible to non-technical workers, similar to how coding capabilities have advanced. He imagines a future where individuals manage not just one AI agent but entire organizations of specialized AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How can everyone be their own mini CPO or CEO?” White asked. “I don’t exactly know what that looks like, but that’s the kind of thing that I wake up and want to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The transformation White describes reflects broader industry trends as companies grapple with AI’s expanding capabilities. While early adoption focused on experimental use cases, enterprises are increasingly integrating AI into core business processes, fundamentally changing how work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI agents become more autonomous and capable, the challenge shifts from teaching machines to perform tasks to managing AI collaborators that can work independently for extended periods. For White, this future is already arriving — one production feature at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The funding round also saw participation from existing investors, including Benchmark, which led Levelpath’s $14.5 million seed round, and Redpoint, the lead investor in the $30 million Series A round announced in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup was founded by Stan Garber and Alex Yakubovich (pictured right), whose previous startup, Scout RFP, was acquired by Workday for $540 million in 2019. During the three years Yakubovich and Garber spent working at Workday, the two identified persistent procurement challenges that motivated them to build a mobile-first, user-friendly platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Levelpath’s timing proved fortuitous; launching right as ChatGPT debuted has enabled the startup to integrate AI capabilities from its inception. This includes reviewing unstructured data in contracts and recommending less expensive, similar products and services. The company now counts Ace Hardware, Amgen, Coupang, and SiriusXM as customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The investment signals confidence in Levelpath’s fast growth and its potential to disrupt a market dominated by legacy players. Procurement software has long been controlled by outdated vendors like Coupa and Ariba, whose clunky systems often drive employees to bypass official processes. This “rogue” spending using corporate credit cards frequently results in overspending and missed opportunities for bulk discounts, according to Battery Ventures general partner Neeraj Agrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, procurement represents companies’ second-largest expenditure after payroll, making software improvements particularly valuable. The procurement software market was valued at $7.3 billion annually in 2023, according to Fortune Business Insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Levelpath is a newer and likely smaller player compared to its main competitors — including Zip, valued at $2.2 billion last fall, and Oro Labs, backed by Felicis — the company seems to have all the right ingredients, including Agrawal, who led Battery’s Series B investment into Coupa and has joined Levelpath’s board. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Coupa, of course, grew into one of the most successful procurement companies of its era. It had a successful IPO in 2016 and several years later was taken private by PE firm Thoma Bravo for $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Agrawal, who likely understands what it takes to build a big business in this category, is equally impressed by Levelpath’s technology and its founders. “They have such a strong reputation for delivering product, being good people to work with, and doing what they say they’re going to do,” Agrawal told TechCrunch. “Customers want to work with them and help them build this next-generation product.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yakubovich and Garber have been friends since attending high school in Ohio. They bonded over their shared heritage as immigrants from the former Soviet Union and a mutual interest in entrepreneurship. The pair have been working together for over 20 years, and their stated goal is to help customers enjoy, rather than avoid, using procurement software.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While procurement might seem like a mundane business function, it offers a direct and significant return on investment by helping companies save money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It makes the cash register ring because of these savings,” Agrawal said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Stan-Alex_Together.png?resize=1200,776" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Levelpath, a procurement software startup founded by the duo behind Scout RFP, has raised $55 million in Series B funding led by Battery Ventures as the company looks to quadruple its revenue this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people started to talk about AI agents and assistants, the number one use case revolved around travel. Could someone be watching a video about the Maldives and direct their AI agent to start finding flights and hotels, and book these seamlessly?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We‘re inching closer to a similar future as the travel industry begins to embrace agentic AI. Kayak and Expedia, two of the largest companies in travel booking, said during VB Transform that personalization and changing search patterns mean travel companies can rely on agents to make travel inspiration a reality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Matthias Keller, chief product officer at Kayak, said the company has been experimenting with this idea for a couple of years, even taking advantage of a partnership with Amazon’s Alexa. Kayak no longer launches on Alexa, but that hasn’t stopped the company from offering different search modes for customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are striving for this vision of a travel agent that is always available, that is agentic and powered by AI,” Keller said onstage at VB Transform. “In April, we launched our new testbed for agentic travel booking called Kayak AI; it’s a fully chat-based agentic experience that puts together the power of ChatGPT and many different tools. One is web search, but we also offer tools specifically for flights or hotels.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keller said Kayak is “working towards our vision of having this fully personalized experienced that does all the heavy lifting for you when you plan travel.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the idea of an agent proactively guiding potential travelers makes for efficient trip planning, Expedia CTO Ramana Thumu noted that there is a delicate balance to strike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“More and more customer expectations will revolve around a seamless experience, from search to completing transactions,” Thumu said. “But the most important thing, and the shift I see happening, is asking for the balance between the control the traveler has, and the control we give to the agent.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;One reason this balance becomes essential is that, increasingly, consumers find travel inspiration everywhere. For one of its AI projects, Expedia decided to capitalize on the growing influence of travel influencers who post their trips on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thumu said Expedia’s Trip Matching feature, which launched in June for U.S. customers, allows people to send any travel-related public Instagram Reel to Expedia, and the platform can build an itinerary based on them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thumu said Expedia can build this type of AI product because of its extensive database amassed over 30 years. Both Thumu and Keller underscored the importance of data in building out these personalizations, a task that can be challenging.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Personalization can go beyond planning a trip based on inspiration or previous preferences, as Keller said; eventually, their platforms and AI agents can also start recommending things to do based on the weather in your planned location during your stay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-helps-simplify-the-complexity"&gt;AI helps simplify the complexity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One use case where companies like Kayak and Expedia find AI to be helpful is for “snackers,” or individuals who search for flights or hotels without any intention of booking. These are usually people who just want to check the price of a flight or find out how much a hotel costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI systems can help snackers find their answers, and may even encourage them to go on that trip, because much of the tediousness of finding accommodation, transportation and activities can be presented to them right there on either the Expedia or Kayak front end.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What I find interesting when I pitch Kayak AI to somebody [is] I can say that we can get this complex trip planned without running all of the searches,” Keller said. “Every hotel booking site out there can tell you that a hotel has a pool, but you have to go deep to find an infinity pool. That’s the type of question that ChatGPT does a great job with, so it’s something we have to adapt and deliver.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement comes about a year after Clio’s massive $900 million funding round, which nearly doubled the Vancouver, British Columbia-based company’s valuation from $1.6 billion in 2021 to $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;vLex, which was largely bootstrapped until it was purchased by private equity firm Oakley Capital in 2022, has been a highly sought-after asset, according to Jack Newton, CEO and founder of Clio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Harvey, the AI-native legal tech startup, attempted to purchase vLex a year ago, but the acquisition didn’t come together, as reported by The Information last July. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;vLex is a valuable property because its database of legal documents can greatly improve AI models for lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Data is one of the only long-term defensible competitive moats a company can have in the space,” Newton told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;vLex competes with the Thomson Reuters-owned legal database and LexisNexis. The acquisition comes shortly after Harvey announced a partnership with LexisNexis, aiming to enrich Harvey’s AI with LexisNexis data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the acquisition of vLex, Clio, which provides law firms with time-tracking, invoicing, and electronic payment tools, is now effectively stepping into the practice of law itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the last few years, vLex has built Vincent, an AI model built on top of the company’s legal content database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI is going to drive a convergence of what have historically been distinct categories of software: the business of law and the practice of law,” Newton said. He added that Clio’s clients in the small and medium law firm segment will now have access to Vincent’s AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to announcing plans to acquire vLex, Clio said it has reached $300 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1474442258.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Monday, Clio, a 17-year-old Canadian law firm management software company, announced that it has agreed to acquire vLex, a 26-year-old legal data intelligence platform, in a $1 billion cash-and-stock deal.&lt;/p&gt;

What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-timeline-of-the-most-recent-chatgpt-updates"&gt;Timeline of the most recent ChatGPT updates&lt;/h2&gt;






&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-june-2025"&gt;June 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-uses-google-s-ai-chips-to-power-its-products"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI uses Google’s AI chips to power its products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-energy-needed-for-an-average-chatgpt-query-can-power-a-lightbulb-for-a-couple-of-minutes"&gt;The energy needed for an average ChatGPT query can power a lightbulb for a couple of minutes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o3-pro-an-upgraded-version-of-its-o3-ai-reasoning-model"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has launched o3-pro, an upgraded version of its o3 AI reasoning model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.…&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 10, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-conversational-voice-mode-has-been-upgraded"&gt;ChatGPT’s conversational voice mode has been upgraded&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-added-new-features-like-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT has added new features like meeting recording and connectors for Google Drive, Box, and more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-may-2025"&gt;May 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cfo-says-hardware-will-drive-chatgpt-s-growth"&gt;OpenAI CFO says hardware will drive ChatGPT’s growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI’s reach to a larger audience in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-chatgpt-unveils-its-ai-coding-agent-codex"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT unveils its AI coding agent, Codex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-altman-aims-to-make-chatgpt-more-personalized-by-tracking-every-aspect-of-a-person-s-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Altman aims to make ChatGPT more personalized by tracking every aspect of a person’s life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-releases-its-gpt-4-1-and-gpt-4-1-mini-ai-models-in-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI releases its GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini AI models in ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks &amp;amp; instruction following. Because it’s faster, it’s a great alternative to OpenAI o3 &amp;amp; o4-mini for everyday coding needs.&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 14, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-deep-research-now-connects-with-github-in-beta-to-answer-code-related-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT deep research now connects with GitHub (in beta) to answer code-related questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-new-data-residency-program-in-asia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches a new data residency program in Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-introduce-a-program-to-grow-ai-infrastructure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to introduce a program to grow AI infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company’s expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-promises-to-make-changes-to-prevent-future-chatgpt-sycophancy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april-2025"&gt;April 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-clarifies-the-reason-chatgpt-became-overly-flattering-and-agreeable"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-to-fix-a-bug-that-let-minors-engage-in-inappropriate-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-helps-users-by-giving-recommendations-showing-images-and-reviewing-products-for-online-shopping"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is continually updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1462188043-e1686340799615.jpg?w=1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-timeline-of-the-most-recent-chatgpt-updates"&gt;Timeline of the most recent ChatGPT updates&lt;/h2&gt;






&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-june-2025"&gt;June 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-uses-google-s-ai-chips-to-power-its-products"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI uses Google’s AI chips to power its products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-energy-needed-for-an-average-chatgpt-query-can-power-a-lightbulb-for-a-couple-of-minutes"&gt;The energy needed for an average ChatGPT query can power a lightbulb for a couple of minutes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o3-pro-an-upgraded-version-of-its-o3-ai-reasoning-model"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has launched o3-pro, an upgraded version of its o3 AI reasoning model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.…&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 10, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-conversational-voice-mode-has-been-upgraded"&gt;ChatGPT’s conversational voice mode has been upgraded&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-added-new-features-like-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT has added new features like meeting recording and connectors for Google Drive, Box, and more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-may-2025"&gt;May 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cfo-says-hardware-will-drive-chatgpt-s-growth"&gt;OpenAI CFO says hardware will drive ChatGPT’s growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI’s reach to a larger audience in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-chatgpt-unveils-its-ai-coding-agent-codex"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT unveils its AI coding agent, Codex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-altman-aims-to-make-chatgpt-more-personalized-by-tracking-every-aspect-of-a-person-s-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Altman aims to make ChatGPT more personalized by tracking every aspect of a person’s life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-releases-its-gpt-4-1-and-gpt-4-1-mini-ai-models-in-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI releases its GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini AI models in ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks &amp;amp; instruction following. Because it’s faster, it’s a great alternative to OpenAI o3 &amp;amp; o4-mini for everyday coding needs.&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 14, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-deep-research-now-connects-with-github-in-beta-to-answer-code-related-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT deep research now connects with GitHub (in beta) to answer code-related questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-new-data-residency-program-in-asia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches a new data residency program in Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-introduce-a-program-to-grow-ai-infrastructure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to introduce a program to grow AI infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company’s expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-promises-to-make-changes-to-prevent-future-chatgpt-sycophancy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april-2025"&gt;April 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-clarifies-the-reason-chatgpt-became-overly-flattering-and-agreeable"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-to-fix-a-bug-that-let-minors-engage-in-inappropriate-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-helps-users-by-giving-recommendations-showing-images-and-reviewing-products-for-online-shopping"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;
