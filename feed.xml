That dramatic surge has created an acute challenge for merchants whose existing bot detection systems — designed to block automated traffic — now risk accidentally blocking legitimate AI shoppers along with bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Merchants need additional tools that provide them with greater insight and transparency into agentic commerce activities to ensure they can participate safely,&amp;quot; said Rubail Birwadker, Visa&amp;#x27;s Global Head of Growth, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;Without common standards, potential risks include ecosystem fragmentation and the proliferation of closed loop models.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are substantial. While 85% of shoppers who have used AI to shop report improved experiences, merchants face the prospect of either turning away legitimate AI-powered customers or exposing themselves to sophisticated bot attacks. Visa&amp;#x27;s own data shows the company &lt;a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.20661.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prevented $40 billion in fraudulent activity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between October 2022 and September 2023, nearly double the previous year, much of it involving AI-powered enumeration attacks where bots systematically test combinations of card numbers until finding valid credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inside the cryptographic handshake: How Visa verifies AI shopping agents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://developer.visa.com/capabilities/trusted-agent-protocol/docs#:~:text=The%20Trusted%20Agent%20Protocol%3A%20This,for%20validating%20an%20agent%27s%20intent."&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trusted Agent Protocol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; operates through what Birwadker describes as a &amp;quot;cryptographic trust handshake&amp;quot; between merchants and approved AI agents. The system works in three steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, AI agents must be approved and onboarded through Visa&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://developer.visa.com/capabilities/visa-intelligent-commerce"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Intelligent Commerce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; program, where they undergo vetting to meet trust and reliability standards. Each approved agent receives a unique digital signature key — essentially a cryptographic credential that proves its identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an approved agent visits a merchant&amp;#x27;s website, it creates a digital signature using its key and transmits three categories of information: Agent Intent (indicating the agent is trusted and intends to retrieve product details or make a purchase), Consumer Recognition (data showing whether the underlying consumer has an existing account with the merchant), and Payment Information (optional payment data to support checkout).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merchants or their infrastructure providers, such as content delivery networks, then validate these digital signatures against Visa&amp;#x27;s registry of approved agents. &amp;quot;Upon proper validation of these fields, the merchant can confirm the signature is a trusted agent,&amp;quot; Birwadker explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, Visa designed the protocol to require minimal changes to existing merchant infrastructure. Built on the &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP Message Signature standard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and aligned with &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/reference/bot-verification/web-bot-auth/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Web Both Auth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the protocol works with existing web infrastructure without requiring merchants to overhaul their checkout pages. &amp;quot;This is no-code functionality,&amp;quot; Birwadker emphasized, though merchants may need to integrate with Visa&amp;#x27;s Developer Center to access the verification system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The race for AI commerce standards: Visa faces competition from Google, OpenAI, and Stripe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa developed the protocol in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the web infrastructure and security company that already provides bot management services to millions of websites. The partnership reflects Visa&amp;#x27;s recognition that solving bot verification requires cooperation across the entire web stack, not just the payments layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Trusted Agent Protocol supplements traditional bot management by providing merchants insights that enable agentic commerce,&amp;quot; Birwadker said. &amp;quot;Agents are providing additional context they otherwise would not, including what it intends to do, who the underlying consumer is, and payment information.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol arrives as multiple technology giants race to establish competing standards for AI commerce. Google recently introduced its &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-agents-to-payments-ap2-protocol"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agent Protocol for Payments (AP2)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stripe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have discussed their own approaches to enabling AI agents to make purchases. Microsoft, Shopify, Adyen, Ant International, Checkout.com, Cybersource, Elavon, Fiserv, Nuvei, and Worldpay provided feedback during Trusted Agent Protocol&amp;#x27;s development, according to Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how Visa&amp;#x27;s protocol relates to these competing efforts, Birwadker struck a collaborative tone. &amp;quot;Both Google&amp;#x27;s AP2 and Visa&amp;#x27;s Trusted Agent Protocol are working toward the same goal of building trust in agent-initiated payments,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We are engaged with Google, OpenAI, and Stripe and are looking to create compatibility across the ecosystem.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa says it is working with global standards bodies including the &lt;a href="https://www.ietf.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://openid.net/foundation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenID Foundation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.emvco.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;EMVCo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the protocol can eventually become interoperable with other emerging standards. &amp;quot;While these specifications apply to the Visa network in this initial phase, enabling agents to safely and securely act on a consumer&amp;#x27;s behalf requires an open, ecosystem-wide approach,&amp;quot; Birwadker noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who pays when AI agents go rogue? Unanswered questions about liability and authorization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol raises important questions about authorization and liability when AI agents make purchases on behalf of consumers. If an agent completes an unauthorized transaction — perhaps misunderstanding a user&amp;#x27;s intent or exceeding its delegated authority — who bears responsibility?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birwadker emphasized that the protocol helps merchants &amp;quot;leverage this information to enable experiences tied to existing consumer relationships and more secure checkout,&amp;quot; but he did not provide specific details about how disputes would be handled when agents make unauthorized purchases. Visa&amp;#x27;s existing fraud protection and chargeback systems would presumably apply, though the company has not yet published detailed guidance on agent-initiated transaction disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol also places Visa in the position of gatekeeper for the emerging agentic commerce ecosystem. Because Visa determines which AI agents get approved for the &lt;a href="https://developer.visa.com/capabilities/visa-intelligent-commerce"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Intelligent Commerce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; program and receive cryptographic credentials, the company effectively controls which agents merchants can easily trust. &amp;quot;Agents are approved and onboarded through the Visa Intelligent Commerce program, ensuring they meet our standards for trust and reliability,&amp;quot; Birwadker said, though he did not detail the specific criteria agents must meet or whether Visa charges fees for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gatekeeping role could prove contentious, particularly if Visa&amp;#x27;s approval process favors large technology companies over startups, or if the company faces pressure to block agents from competitors or politically controversial entities. Visa declined to provide details about how many agents it has approved so far or how long the vetting process typically takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visa&amp;#x27;s legal battles and the long road to merchant adoption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol launch comes at a complex moment for Visa, which continues to navigate significant legal and regulatory challenges even as its core business remains robust. The company&amp;#x27;s latest &lt;a href="https://investor.visa.com/financial-information/quarterly-earnings/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earnings report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 showed a 10% increase in net revenues to $9.2 billion, driven by resilient consumer spending and strong growth in cross-border transaction volume. For the full fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, Visa processed 289 billion transactions, with a total payments volume of $15.2 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the company&amp;#x27;s legal headwinds have intensified. In July 2025, a federal judge rejected a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rejects-visa-mastercard-30-bln-swipe-fee-settlement-2024-06-25/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$30 billion settlement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Visa and Mastercard had reached with merchants over long-disputed credit card swipe fees, sending the parties back to the negotiating table and extending the long-running legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-visa-monopolizing-debit-markets"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Visa remains under investigation by the Department of Justice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over its rules for routing debit card transactions, with regulators scrutinizing whether the company&amp;#x27;s practices unlawfully limit merchant choice and stifle competition. These domestic challenges are mirrored abroad, where European regulators have continued their own antitrust investigations into the fee structures of both Visa and its primary competitor, Mastercard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop of regulatory pressure, Birwadker acknowledged that adoption of the Trusted Agent Protocol will take time. &amp;quot;As agentic commerce continues to rise, we recognize that consumer trust is still in its early stages,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s why our focus through 2025 is on building foundational credibility and demonstrating real-world value.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol is available immediately in &lt;a href="https://developer.visa.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Visa&amp;#x27;s Developer Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://github.com/visa"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GitHub&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with agent onboarding already active and merchant integration resources available. But Birwadker declined to provide specific targets for how many merchants might adopt the protocol by the end of 2026. &amp;quot;Adoption is aligned with the momentum we&amp;#x27;re already seeing,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;The launch of our protocol marks another big step — it&amp;#x27;s not just a technical milestone, but a signal that the industry is beginning to unify.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts say merchant adoption will likely depend on how quickly agentic commerce grows as a percentage of overall e-commerce. While AI-driven traffic has surged dramatically, much of that consists of agents browsing and researching rather than completing purchases. If AI agents begin accounting for a significant share of completed transactions, merchants will face stronger incentives to adopt verification systems like Visa&amp;#x27;s protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;From fraud detection to AI gatekeeping: Visa&amp;#x27;s $10 billion bet on artificial intelligence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa&amp;#x27;s move reflects broader strategic bets on AI across the financial services industry. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/26/ai-and-machine-learning-helped-visa-combat-40-billion-in-fraud-activity.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;invested $10 billion in technology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the past five years to reduce fraud and increase network security, with AI and machine learning central to those efforts. Visa&amp;#x27;s fraud detection system analyzes over 500 different attributes for each transaction, using AI models to assign real-time risk scores to the 300 billion annual transactions flowing through its network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every single one of those transactions has been processed by AI,&amp;quot; James Mirfin, Visa&amp;#x27;s global head of risk and identity solutions, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/26/ai-and-machine-learning-helped-visa-combat-40-billion-in-fraud-activity.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;July 2024 CNBC interview&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discussing the company&amp;#x27;s fraud prevention efforts. &amp;quot;If you see a new type of fraud happening, our model will see that, it will catch it, it will score those transactions as high risk and then our customers can decide not to approve those transactions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has also moved aggressively into new payment territories beyond its core card business. In January 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/elon-musk-x-visa-digital-wallet.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Visa partnered with Elon Musk&amp;#x27;s X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Twitter) to provide the infrastructure for a digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment service called the X Money Account, competing with services like Venmo and Zelle. That deal marked Visa&amp;#x27;s first major partnership in the social media payments space and reflected the company&amp;#x27;s recognition that payment flows are increasingly happening outside traditional e-commerce channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agentic commerce protocol represents an extension of this strategy — an attempt to ensure Visa remains central to payment flows even as the mechanics of shopping shift from direct human interaction to AI intermediation. &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/visa-launches-intelligent-commerce-platform-letting-ai-agents-swipe-your-card-safely-it-says"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jack Forestell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Visa&amp;#x27;s Chief Product &amp;amp; Strategy Officer, framed the protocol in expansive terms: &amp;quot;We believe the entire payments ecosystem has a responsibility to ensure sellers trust AI agents with the same confidence they place in their most valued customers and networks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The coming battle for control of AI shopping&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real test for Visa&amp;#x27;s protocol won&amp;#x27;t be technical — it will be political. As AI agents become a larger force in retail, whoever controls the verification infrastructure controls access to hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce. Visa&amp;#x27;s position as gatekeeper gives it enormous leverage, but also makes it a target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merchants chafing under Visa&amp;#x27;s existing fee structure and facing multiple antitrust investigations may resist ceding even more power to the payments giant. Competitors like Google and OpenAI, each with their own ambitions in commerce, have little incentive to let Visa dictate standards. Regulators already scrutinizing Visa&amp;#x27;s market dominance will surely examine whether its agent approval process unfairly advantages certain players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#x27;s a deeper question lurking beneath the technical specifications and corporate partnerships: In an economy increasingly mediated by AI, who decides which algorithms get to spend our money? Visa is making an aggressive bid to be that arbiter, wrapping its answer in the language of security and interoperability. Whether merchants, consumers, and regulators accept that proposition will determine not just the fate of the Trusted Agent Protocol, but the structure of AI-powered commerce itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Visa is moving forward with the confidence of a company that has weathered disruption before. But in the emerging world of agentic commerce, being too trusted might prove just as dangerous as not being trusted enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Microsoft, Shopify, Adyen, Ant International, Checkout.com, Cybersource, Elavon, Fiserv, Nuvei, and Worldpay provided feedback during Trusted Agent Protocol&amp;#x27;s development, according to Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how Visa&amp;#x27;s protocol relates to these competing efforts, Birwadker struck a collaborative tone. &amp;quot;Both Google&amp;#x27;s AP2 and Visa&amp;#x27;s Trusted Agent Protocol are working toward the same goal of building trust in agent-initiated payments,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We are engaged with Google, OpenAI, and Stripe and are looking to create compatibility across the ecosystem.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa says it is working with global standards bodies including the &lt;a href="https://www.ietf.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://openid.net/foundation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenID Foundation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.emvco.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;EMVCo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the protocol can eventually become interoperable with other emerging standards. &amp;quot;While these specifications apply to the Visa network in this initial phase, enabling agents to safely and securely act on a consumer&amp;#x27;s behalf requires an open, ecosystem-wide approach,&amp;quot; Birwadker noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who pays when AI agents go rogue?

The company&amp;#x27;s latest &lt;a href="https://investor.visa.com/financial-information/quarterly-earnings/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earnings report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 showed a 10% increase in net revenues to $9.2 billion, driven by resilient consumer spending and strong growth in cross-border transaction volume. For the full fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, Visa processed 289 billion transactions, with a total payments volume of $15.2 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the company&amp;#x27;s legal headwinds have intensified. In July 2025, a federal judge rejected a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rejects-visa-mastercard-30-bln-swipe-fee-settlement-2024-06-25/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$30 billion settlement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Visa and Mastercard had reached with merchants over long-disputed credit card swipe fees, sending the parties back to the negotiating table and extending the long-running legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-visa-monopolizing-debit-markets"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Visa remains under investigation by the Department of Justice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over its rules for routing debit card transactions, with regulators scrutinizing whether the company&amp;#x27;s practices unlawfully limit merchant choice and stifle competition. These domestic challenges are mirrored abroad, where European regulators have continued their own antitrust investigations into the fee structures of both Visa and its primary competitor, Mastercard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop of regulatory pressure, Birwadker acknowledged that adoption of the Trusted Agent Protocol will take time. &amp;quot;As agentic commerce continues to rise, we recognize that consumer trust is still in its early stages,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s why our focus through 2025 is on building foundational credibility and demonstrating real-world value.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol is available immediately in &lt;a href="https://developer.visa.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Visa&amp;#x27;s Developer Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://github.com/visa"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GitHub&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with agent onboarding already active and merchant integration resources available. But Birwadker declined to provide specific targets for how many merchants might adopt the protocol by the end of 2026. &amp;quot;Adoption is aligned with the momentum we&amp;#x27;re already seeing,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;The launch of our protocol marks another big step — it&amp;#x27;s not just a technical milestone, but a signal that the industry is beginning to unify.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts say merchant adoption will likely depend on how quickly agentic commerce grows as a percentage of overall e-commerce. While AI-driven traffic has surged dramatically, much of that consists of agents browsing and researching rather than completing purchases. If AI agents begin accounting for a significant share of completed transactions, merchants will face stronger incentives to adopt verification systems like Visa&amp;#x27;s protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;From fraud detection to AI gatekeeping: Visa&amp;#x27;s $10 billion bet on artificial intelligence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa&amp;#x27;s move reflects broader strategic bets on AI across the financial services industry. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/26/ai-and-machine-learning-helped-visa-combat-40-billion-in-fraud-activity.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;invested $10 billion in technology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the past five years to reduce fraud and increase network security, with AI and machine learning central to those efforts. Visa&amp;#x27;s fraud detection system analyzes over 500 different attributes for each transaction, using AI models to assign real-time risk scores to the 300 billion annual transactions flowing through its network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every single one of those transactions has been processed by AI,&amp;quot; James Mirfin, Visa&amp;#x27;s global head of risk and identity solutions, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/26/ai-and-machine-learning-helped-visa-combat-40-billion-in-fraud-activity.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;July 2024 CNBC interview&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discussing the company&amp;#x27;s fraud prevention efforts. &amp;quot;If you see a new type of fraud happening, our model will see that, it will catch it, it will score those transactions as high risk and then our customers can decide not to approve those transactions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has also moved aggressively into new payment territories beyond its core card business. In January 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/elon-musk-x-visa-digital-wallet.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Visa partnered with Elon Musk&amp;#x27;s X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Twitter) to provide the infrastructure for a digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment service called the X Money Account, competing with services like Venmo and Zelle. That deal marked Visa&amp;#x27;s first major partnership in the social media payments space and reflected the company&amp;#x27;s recognition that payment flows are increasingly happening outside traditional e-commerce channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agentic commerce protocol represents an extension of this strategy — an attempt to ensure Visa remains central to payment flows even as the mechanics of shopping shift from direct human interaction to AI intermediation. &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/visa-launches-intelligent-commerce-platform-letting-ai-agents-swipe-your-card-safely-it-says"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jack Forestell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Visa&amp;#x27;s Chief Product &amp;amp; Strategy Officer, framed the protocol in expansive terms: &amp;quot;We believe the entire payments ecosystem has a responsibility to ensure sellers trust AI agents with the same confidence they place in their most valued customers and networks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The coming battle for control of AI shopping&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real test for Visa&amp;#x27;s protocol won&amp;#x27;t be technical — it will be political. As AI agents become a larger force in retail, whoever controls the verification infrastructure controls access to hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce. Visa&amp;#x27;s position as gatekeeper gives it enormous leverage, but also makes it a target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merchants chafing under Visa&amp;#x27;s existing fee structure and facing multiple antitrust investigations may resist ceding even more power to the payments giant. Competitors like Google and OpenAI, each with their own ambitions in commerce, have little incentive to let Visa dictate standards. Regulators already scrutinizing Visa&amp;#x27;s market dominance will surely examine whether its agent approval process unfairly advantages certain players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#x27;s a deeper question lurking beneath the technical specifications and corporate partnerships: In an economy increasingly mediated by AI, who decides which algorithms get to spend our money? Visa is making an aggressive bid to be that arbiter, wrapping its answer in the language of security and interoperability. Whether merchants, consumers, and regulators accept that proposition will determine not just the fate of the Trusted Agent Protocol, but the structure of AI-powered commerce itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Visa is moving forward with the confidence of a company that has weathered disruption before. But in the emerging world of agentic commerce, being too trusted might prove just as dangerous as not being trusted enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

He recently shared a photo of a former classmate. “Can you believe we’re the same age?” he asked, with a hint of glee in his voice. A relative also delights in this pastime. “Wow, she looks like an old woman,” she’ll say when looking at a picture of someone she has known since childhood. The years certainly are kinder to some of us than others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But wrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well—or poorly—someone’s body is truly aging, under the hood. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging (such as elevated cholesterol or markers of inflammation), might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn’t have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long used functional tests that measure their patients’ strength or the distance they can walk, for example, or simply “eyeball” them to guess whether they look fit enough to survive some treatment regimen, says Tamir Chandra, who studies aging at the Mayo Clinic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. What they’ve found is changing our understanding of aging itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Aging clocks” are new scientific tools that can measure how our organs are wearing out, giving us insight into our mortality and health. They hint at our &lt;em&gt;biological&lt;/em&gt; age. While chronological age is simply how many birthdays we’ve had, biological age is meant to reflect something deeper. It measures how our bodies are handling the passing of time and—perhaps—lets us know how much more of it we have left. And while you can’t change your chronological age, you just might be able to influence your biological age.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s not just scientists who are using these clocks. Longevity influencers like Bryan Johnson often use them to make the case that they are aging backwards. “My telomeres say I’m 10 years old,” Johnson posted on X in April. The Kardashians have tried them too (Khloé was told on TV that her biological age was 12 years below her chronological age). Even my local health-food store offers biological age testing. Some are pushing the use of clocks even further, using them to sell unproven “anti-aging” supplements.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The science is still new, and few experts in the field—some of whom affectionately refer to it as “clock world”—would argue that an aging clock can definitively reveal an individual’s biological age.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But their work is revealing that aging clocks can offer so much more than an insta-brag, a snake-oil pitch—or even just an eye-catching number. In fact, they are helping scientists unravel some of the deepest mysteries in biology: &lt;em&gt;Why &lt;/em&gt;do we age? &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; do we age? &lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt; does aging begin? What does it even mean to age?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, and most importantly, they might soon tell us whether we can reverse the whole process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Clocks kick off&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The way your genes work can change. Molecules called methyl groups can attach to DNA, controlling the way genes make proteins. This process is called methylation, and it can potentially occur at millions of points along the genome. These epigenetic markers, as they are known, can switch genes on or off, or increase or decrease how much protein they make. They’re not part of our DNA, but they influence how it works.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Steve Horvath, then a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles, took part in a study that was looking for links between sexual orientation and these epigenetic markers. Steve is straight; he says his twin brother, Markus, who also volunteered, is gay.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That study didn’t find a link between DNA methyl­ation and sexual orientation. But when Horvath looked at the data, he noticed a different trend—a very strong link between age and methylation at around 88 points on the genome. He once told me he fell off his chair when he saw it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many of the affected genes had already been linked to age-related brain and cardiovascular diseases, but it wasn’t clear how methylation might be related to those diseases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. It could help us understand what aging is, and why it happens at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2013, Horvath collected methylation data from 8,000 tissue and cell samples to create what he called the Horvath clock—essentially a mathematical model that could estimate age on the basis of DNA methylation at 353 points on the genome. From a tissue sample, it was able to detect a person’s age within a range of 2.9 years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That clock changed everything. Its publication in 2013 marked the birth of “clock world.” To some, the possibilities were almost endless. If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. It could help us understand what aging is, and why it happens at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The epigenetic clock was a success story in “a field that, frankly, doesn’t have a lot of success stories,” says João Pedro de Magalhães, who researches aging at the University of Birmingham, UK.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It took a few years, but as more aging researchers heard about the clock, they began incorporating it into their research and even developing their own clocks. Horvath became a bit of a celebrity. Scientists started asking for selfies with him at conferences, he says. Some researchers even made T-shirts bearing the front page of his 2013 paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the many other aging clocks developed since have become notable in their own right. Examples include the PhenoAge clock, which incorporates health data such as blood cell counts and signs of inflammation along with methyl­ation, and the Dunedin Pace of Aging clock, which tells you how quickly or slowly a person is aging rather than pointing to a specific age. Many of the clocks measure methylation, but some look at other variables, such as proteins in blood or certain carbohydrate molecules that attach to such proteins.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, there are hundreds or even thousands of clocks out there, says Chiara Herzog, who researches aging at King’s College London and is a member of the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium. Everyone has a favorite. Horvath himself favors his GrimAge clock, which was named after the Grim Reaper because it is designed to predict time to death.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That clock was trained on data collected from people who were monitored for decades, many of whom died in that period. Horvath won’t use it to tell people when they might die of old age, he stresses, saying that it wouldn’t be ethical. Instead, it can be used to deliver a biological age that &lt;em&gt;hints &lt;/em&gt;at how long a person might expect to live. Someone who is 50 but has a GrimAge of 60 can assume that, compared with the average 50-year-old, they might be a bit closer to the end.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;GrimAge is not perfect. While it can strongly predict time to death given the health trajectory someone is on, no aging clock can predict if someone will start smoking or get a divorce (which generally speeds aging) or suddenly take up running (which can generally slow it). “People are complicated,” Horvath tells &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. “There’s a huge error bar.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;On the whole, the clocks are pretty good at making predictions about health and lifespan. They’ve been able to predict that people over the age of 105 have lower biological ages, which tracks given how rare it is for people to make it past that age. A higher epigenetic age has been linked to declining cognitive function and signs of Alzheimer’s disease, while better physical and cognitive fitness has been linked to a lower epigenetic age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Black-box clocks&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But accuracy is a challenge for all aging clocks. Part of the problem lies in how they were designed. Most of the clocks were trained to link age with methylation. The best clocks will deliver an estimate that reflects how far a person’s biology deviates from the average. Aging clocks are still judged on how well they can predict a person’s chronological age, but you don’t want them to be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; close, says Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, head of machine learning at Shift Bioscience, who was awarded $10,000 by the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for developing a clock that could estimate age within a range of 2.55 years.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="a cartoon alarm clock shrugging" class="wp-image-1125411" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_Clock_final.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;None of the clocks are precise enough to predict the biological age of a single person.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Putting the same biological sample through five different clocks will give you five wildly different results.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;LEON EDLER&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s this paradox,” says Camillo. If a clock is really good at predicting chronological age, that’s all it will tell you—and it probably won’t reveal much about your biological age. No one needs an aging clock to tell them how many birthdays they’ve had. Camillo says he’s noticed that when the clocks get too close to “perfect” age prediction, they actually become less accurate at predicting mortality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Therein lies the other central issue for scientists who develop and use aging clocks: What is the thing they are really measuring? It is a difficult question for a field whose members notoriously fail to agree on the basics. (Everything from the definition of aging to how it occurs and why is up for debate among the experts.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;They do agree that aging is incredibly complex. A methylation-based aging clock might tell you about how that collection of chemical markers compares across individuals, but at best, it’s only giving you an idea of their “epigenetic age,” says Chandra. There are probably plenty of other biological markers that might reveal other aspects of aging, he says: “None of the clocks measure everything.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We don’t know why some methyl groups appear or disappear with age, either. Are these changes causing damage? Or are they a by-product of it? Are the epigenetic patterns seen in a 90-year-old a sign of deterioration? Or have they been responsible for keeping that person alive into very old age?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To make matters even more complicated, two different clocks can give similar answers by measuring methylation at entirely different regions of the genome. No one knows why, or which regions might be the best ones to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The biomarkers have this black-box quality,” says Jesse Poganik at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “Some of them are probably causal, some of them may be adaptive … and some of them may just be neutral”: either “there’s no reason for them not to happen” or “they just happen by random chance.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;What we know is that, as things stand, none of the clocks are precise enough to predict the biological age of a single person (sorry, Khloé). Putting the same biological sample through five different clocks will give you five wildly different results.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; clock can give you different answers if you put a sample through it more than once. “They’re not yet individually predictive,” says Herzog. “We don’t know what [a clock result] means for a person, [or if] they’re more or less likely to develop disease.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And it’s why plenty of aging researchers—even those who regularly use the clocks in their work—haven’t bothered to measure their own epigenetic age. “Let’s say I do a clock and it says that my biological age … is five years older than it should be,” says Magalhães. “So what?” He shrugs. “I don’t see much point in it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You might think this lack of clarity would make aging clocks pretty useless in a clinical setting. But plenty of clinics are offering them anyway. Some longevity clinics are more careful, and will regularly test their patients with a range of clocks, noting their results and tracking them over time. Others will simply offer an estimate of biological age as part of a longevity treatment package.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then there are the people who use aging clocks to sell supplements. While no drug or supplement has been definitively shown to make people live longer, that hasn’t stopped the lightly regulated wellness industry from pushing a range of “treatments” that range from lotions to herbal pills all the way through to stem-cell injections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of these people come to aging meetings. I was in the audience at an event when one CEO took to the stage to claim he had reversed his own biological age by 18 years—thanks to the supplement he was selling. Tom Weldon of Ponce de Leon Health told us his gray hair was turning brown. His biological age was supposedly reversing so rapidly that he had reached “longevity escape velocity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if the people who buy his supplements expect some kind of Benjamin Button effect, they might be disappointed. His company hasn’t yet conducted a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate any anti-aging effects of that supplement, called Rejuvant. Weldon says that such a trial would take years and cost millions of dollars, and that he’d “have to increase the price of our product more than four times” to pay for one. (The company has so far tested the active ingredient in mice and carried out a provisional trial in people.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More generally, Horvath says he “gets a bad taste in [his] mouth” when people use the clocks to sell products and “make a quick buck.” But he thinks that most of those sellers have genuine faith in both the clocks and their products. “People truly believe their own nonsense,” he says. “They are so passionate about what they discovered, they fall into this trap of believing [their] own prejudices.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The accuracy of the clocks is at a level that makes them useful for research, but not for individual predictions. Even if a clock did tell someone they were five years younger than their chronological age, that wouldn’t necessarily mean the person could expect to live five years longer, says Magalhães. “The field of aging has long been a rich ground for snake-oil salesmen and hype,” he says. “It comes with the territory.” (Weldon, for his part, says Rejuvant is the only product that has “clinically meaningful” claims.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In any case, Magalhães adds that he thinks any publicity is better than no publicity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And there’s the rub. Most people in the longevity field seem to have mixed feelings about the trendiness of aging clocks and how they are being used. They’ll agree that the clocks aren’t ready for consumer prime time, but they tend to appreciate the attention. Longevity research is expensive, after all. With a surge in funding and an explosion in the number of biotech companies working on longevity, aging scientists are hopeful that innovation and progress will follow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So they want to be sure that the reputation of aging clocks doesn’t end up being tarnished by association. Because while influencers and supplement sellers are using their “biological ages” to garner attention, scientists are now using these clocks to make some remarkable discoveries. Discoveries that are changing the way we think about aging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to be young again&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two little mice lie side by side, anesthetized and unconscious, as Jim White prepares his scalpel. The animals are of the same breed but look decidedly different. One is a youthful three-month-old, its fur thick, black, and glossy. By comparison, the second mouse, a 20-month-old, looks a little the worse for wear. Its fur is graying and patchy. Its whiskers are short, and it generally looks kind of frail.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the two mice are about to have a lot more in common. White, with some help from a colleague, makes incisions along the side of each mouse’s body and into the upper part of an arm and leg on the same side. He then carefully stitches the two animals together—membranes, fascia, and skin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The procedure takes around an hour, and the mice are then roused from their anesthesia. At first, the two still-groggy animals pull away from each other. But within a few days, they seem to have accepted that they now share their bodies. Soon their circulatory systems will fuse, and the animals will share a blood flow too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="cartoon man in profile with a stick of a wrist watch around a lit stick of dynamite in his mouth" class="wp-image-1125412" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_Dynamite_final.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“People are complicated. There’s a huge error bar.” — Steve Horvath, former biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;LEON EDLER&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;White, who studies aging at Duke University, has been stitching mice together for years; he has performed this strange procedure, known as heterochronic parabiosis, more than a hundred times. And he’s seen a curious phenomenon occur. The older mice appear to benefit from the arrangement. They seem to &lt;em&gt;get younger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Experiments with heterochronic parabiosis have been performed for decades, but typically scientists keep the mice attached to each other for only a few weeks, says White. In their experiment, he and his colleagues left the mice attached for three months—equivalent to around 10 human years. The team then carefully separated the animals to assess how each of them had fared. “You’d think that they’d want to separate immediately,” says White. “But when you detach them … they kind of follow each other around.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The most striking result of that experiment was that the older mice who had been attached to a younger mouse ended up living longer than other mice of a similar age. “[They lived] around 10% longer, but [they] also maintained a lot of [their] function,” says White. They were more active and maintained their strength for longer, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When his colleagues, including Poganik, applied aging clocks to the mice, they found that their epigenetic ages were lower than expected. “The young circulation slowed aging in the old mice,” says White. The effect seemed to last, too—at least for a little while. “It preserved that youthful state for longer than we expected,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The young mice went the other way and appeared biologically older, both while they were attached to the old mice and shortly after they were detached. But in their case, the effect seemed to be short-lived, says White: “The young mice went back to being young again.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To White, this suggests that something about the “youthful state” might be programmed in some way. That perhaps it is written into our DNA. Maybe we don’t have to go through the biological process of aging.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This gets at a central debate in the aging field: What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; aging, and why does it happen? Some believe it’s simply a result of accumulated damage. Some believe that the aging process is programmed; just as we grow limbs, develop a brain, reach puberty, and experience menopause, we are destined to deteriorate. Others think programs that play an important role in our early development just turn out to be harmful later in life by chance. And there are some scientists who agree with all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;White’s theory is that being old is just “a loss of youth,” he says. If that’s the case, there’s a silver lining: Knowing how youth is lost might point toward a way to somehow regain it, perhaps by restoring those youthful programs in some way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dogs and dolphins&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Horvath’s eponymous clock was developed by measuring methylation in DNA samples taken from tissues around the body. It seems to represent aging in all these tissues, which is why Horvath calls it a pan-tissue clock. Given that our organs are thought to age differently, it was remarkable that a single clock could measure aging in so many of them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Horvath had ambitious plans for an even more universal clock: a &lt;em&gt;pan-species&lt;/em&gt; model that could measure aging in all mammals. He started out, in 2017, with an email campaign that involved asking hundreds of scientists around the world to share samples of tissues from animals they had worked with. He tried zoos, too.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging—not just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I learned that people had spent careers collecting [animal] tissues,” he says. “They had freezers full of [them].” Amenable scientists would ship those frozen tissues, or just DNA, to Horvath’s lab in California, where he would use them to train a new model.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Horvath says he initially set out to profile 30 different species. But he ended up receiving around 15,000 samples from 200 scientists, representing 348 species—including everything from dogs to dolphins. Could a single clock really predict age in all of them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I truly felt it would fail,” says Horvath. “But it turned out that I was completely wrong.” He and his colleagues developed a clock that assessed methylation at 36,000 locations on the genome. The result, which was published in 2023 as the pan-mammalian clock, can estimate the age of any mammal and even the maximum lifespan of the species. The data set is open to anyone who wants to download it, he adds: “I hope people will mine the data to find the secret of how to extend a healthy lifespan.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging—not just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Comparisons between mammals also support the idea that the slower methylation changes occur, the longer the lifespan of the animal, says Nelly Olova, an epigeneticist who researches aging at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. “DNA methylation slowly erodes with age,” she says. “We still have the instructions in place, but they become a little messier.” The research in different mammals suggests that cells can take only so much change before they stop functioning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s a finite amount of change that the cell can tolerate,” she says. “If the instructions become too messy and noisy … it cannot support life.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Olova has been investigating exactly when aging clocks first begin to tick—in other words, the point at which aging starts. Clocks can be trained on data from volunteers, and by matching the patterns of methylation on their DNA to their chronological age. The trained clocks are then typically used to estimate the biological age of adults. But they can also be used on samples from children. Or babies. They can be used to work out the biological age of cells that make up embryos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In her research, Olova used adult skin cells, which—thanks to Nobel Prize–winning research in the 2000s—can be “reprogrammed” back to a state resembling that of the pluripotent stem cells found in embryos. When Olova and her colleagues used a “partial reprogramming” approach to take cells close to that state, they found that the closer they got to the entirely reprogrammed state, the “younger” the cells were.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was around 20 days after the cells had been reprogrammed into stem cells that they reached the biological age of zero according to the clock used, says Olova. “It was a bit surreal,” she says. “The pluripotent cells measure as &lt;em&gt;minus &lt;/em&gt;0.5; they’re slightly below zero.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vadim Gladyshev, a prominent aging researcher at Harvard University, has since proposed that the same negative level of aging might apply to embryos. After all, some kind of rejuvenation happens during the early stages of embryo formation—an aged egg cell and an aged sperm cell somehow create a brand-new cell. The slate is wiped clean.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gladyshev calls this point “ground zero.” He posits that it’s reached sometime during the “mid-embryonic state.” At this point, aging begins. And so does “organismal life,” he argues. “It’s interesting how this coincides with philosophical questions about when life starts,” says Olova.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some have argued that life begins when sperm meets egg, while others have suggested that the point when embryonic cells start to form some kind of unified structure is what counts. The ground zero point is when the body plan is set out and cells begin to organize accordingly, she says. “Before that, it’s just a bunch of cells.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that life begins at the embryonic state, but it does suggest that this is when aging begins—perhaps as the result of “a generational clearance of damage,” says Poganik.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is early days—no pun intended—for this research, and the science is far from settled. But knowing when aging begins could help inform attempts to rewind the clock. If scientists can pinpoint an ideal biological age for cells, perhaps they can find ways to get old cells back to that state. There might be a way to slow aging once cells reach a certain biological age, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Presumably, there may be opportunities for targeting aging before … you’re full of gray hair,” says Poganik. “It could mean that there is an ideal window for intervention which is much earlier than our current geriatrics-based approach.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When young meets old&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When White first started stitching mice together, he would sit and watch them for hours. “I was like, look at them go! They’re together, and they don’t even care!” he says. Since then, he’s learned a few tricks. He tends to work with female mice, for instance—the males tend to bicker and nip at each other, he says. The females, on the other hand, seem to get on well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The effect their partnership appears to have on their biological ages, if only temporarily, is among the ways aging clocks are helping us understand that biological age is plastic to some degree. White and his colleagues have also found, for instance, that stress seems to increase biological age, but that the effect can be reversed once the stress stops. Both pregnancy and covid-19 infections have a similar reversible effect.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Poganik wonders if this finding might have applications for human organ transplants. Perhaps there’s a way to measure the biological age of an organ before it is transplanted and somehow rejuvenate organs before surgery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But new data from aging clocks suggests that this might be more complicated than it sounds. Poganik and his colleagues have been using methylation clocks to measure the biological age of samples taken from recently transplanted hearts in living people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If being old is simply a case of losing our youthfulness, then that might give us a clue to how we can somehow regain it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Young hearts do well in older bodies, but the biological age of these organs eventually creeps up to match that of their recipient. The same is true for older hearts in younger bodies, says Poganik, who has not yet published his findings. “After a few months, the tissue may assimilate the biological age of the organism,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If that’s the case, the benefits of young organs might be short-lived. It also suggests that scientists working on ways to rejuvenate individual organs may need to focus their anti-aging efforts on more systemic means of rejuvenation—for example, stem cells that repopulate the blood. Reprogramming these cells to a youthful state, perhaps one a little closer to “ground zero,” might be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whole-body rejuvenation might be some way off, but scientists are still hopeful that aging clocks might help them find a way to reverse aging in people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We have the machinery to reset our epigenetic clock to a more youthful state,” says White. “That means we have the ability to turn the clock backwards.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be honest: Have you ever looked up someone from your childhood on social media with the sole intention of seeing how they’ve aged?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of my colleagues, who shall remain nameless, certainly has. He recently shared a photo of a former classmate. “Can you believe we’re the same age?” he asked, with a hint of glee in his voice. A relative also delights in this pastime. “Wow, she looks like an old woman,” she’ll say when looking at a picture of someone she has known since childhood. The years certainly are kinder to some of us than others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But wrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well—or poorly—someone’s body is truly aging, under the hood. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging (such as elevated cholesterol or markers of inflammation), might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn’t have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long used functional tests that measure their patients’ strength or the distance they can walk, for example, or simply “eyeball” them to guess whether they look fit enough to survive some treatment regimen, says Tamir Chandra, who studies aging at the Mayo Clinic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. What they’ve found is changing our understanding of aging itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Aging clocks” are new scientific tools that can measure how our organs are wearing out, giving us insight into our mortality and health. They hint at our &lt;em&gt;biological&lt;/em&gt; age. While chronological age is simply how many birthdays we’ve had, biological age is meant to reflect something deeper. It measures how our bodies are handling the passing of time and—perhaps—lets us know how much more of it we have left. And while you can’t change your chronological age, you just might be able to influence your biological age.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s not just scientists who are using these clocks. Longevity influencers like Bryan Johnson often use them to make the case that they are aging backwards. “My telomeres say I’m 10 years old,” Johnson posted on X in April. The Kardashians have tried them too (Khloé was told on TV that her biological age was 12 years below her chronological age). Even my local health-food store offers biological age testing. Some are pushing the use of clocks even further, using them to sell unproven “anti-aging” supplements.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The science is still new, and few experts in the field—some of whom affectionately refer to it as “clock world”—would argue that an aging clock can definitively reveal an individual’s biological age.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But their work is revealing that aging clocks can offer so much more than an insta-brag, a snake-oil pitch—or even just an eye-catching number. In fact, they are helping scientists unravel some of the deepest mysteries in biology: &lt;em&gt;Why &lt;/em&gt;do we age? &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; do we age? &lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt; does aging begin? What does it even mean to age?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, and most importantly, they might soon tell us whether we can reverse the whole process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Clocks kick off&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The way your genes work can change. Molecules called methyl groups can attach to DNA, controlling the way genes make proteins. This process is called methylation, and it can potentially occur at millions of points along the genome. These epigenetic markers, as they are known, can switch genes on or off, or increase or decrease how much protein they make. They’re not part of our DNA, but they influence how it works.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Steve Horvath, then a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles, took part in a study that was looking for links between sexual orientation and these epigenetic markers. Steve is straight; he says his twin brother, Markus, who also volunteered, is gay.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That study didn’t find a link between DNA methyl­ation and sexual orientation. But when Horvath looked at the data, he noticed a different trend—a very strong link between age and methylation at around 88 points on the genome. He once told me he fell off his chair when he saw it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many of the affected genes had already been linked to age-related brain and cardiovascular diseases, but it wasn’t clear how methylation might be related to those diseases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. It could help us understand what aging is, and why it happens at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2013, Horvath collected methylation data from 8,000 tissue and cell samples to create what he called the Horvath clock—essentially a mathematical model that could estimate age on the basis of DNA methylation at 353 points on the genome. From a tissue sample, it was able to detect a person’s age within a range of 2.9 years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That clock changed everything. Its publication in 2013 marked the birth of “clock world.” To some, the possibilities were almost endless. If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. It could help us understand what aging is, and why it happens at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The epigenetic clock was a success story in “a field that, frankly, doesn’t have a lot of success stories,” says João Pedro de Magalhães, who researches aging at the University of Birmingham, UK.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It took a few years, but as more aging researchers heard about the clock, they began incorporating it into their research and even developing their own clocks. Horvath became a bit of a celebrity. Scientists started asking for selfies with him at conferences, he says. Some researchers even made T-shirts bearing the front page of his 2013 paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the many other aging clocks developed since have become notable in their own right. Examples include the PhenoAge clock, which incorporates health data such as blood cell counts and signs of inflammation along with methyl­ation, and the Dunedin Pace of Aging clock, which tells you how quickly or slowly a person is aging rather than pointing to a specific age. Many of the clocks measure methylation, but some look at other variables, such as proteins in blood or certain carbohydrate molecules that attach to such proteins.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, there are hundreds or even thousands of clocks out there, says Chiara Herzog, who researches aging at King’s College London and is a member of the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium. Everyone has a favorite. Horvath himself favors his GrimAge clock, which was named after the Grim Reaper because it is designed to predict time to death.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That clock was trained on data collected from people who were monitored for decades, many of whom died in that period. Horvath won’t use it to tell people when they might die of old age, he stresses, saying that it wouldn’t be ethical. Instead, it can be used to deliver a biological age that &lt;em&gt;hints &lt;/em&gt;at how long a person might expect to live. Someone who is 50 but has a GrimAge of 60 can assume that, compared with the average 50-year-old, they might be a bit closer to the end.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;GrimAge is not perfect. While it can strongly predict time to death given the health trajectory someone is on, no aging clock can predict if someone will start smoking or get a divorce (which generally speeds aging) or suddenly take up running (which can generally slow it). “People are complicated,” Horvath tells &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. “There’s a huge error bar.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;On the whole, the clocks are pretty good at making predictions about health and lifespan. They’ve been able to predict that people over the age of 105 have lower biological ages, which tracks given how rare it is for people to make it past that age. A higher epigenetic age has been linked to declining cognitive function and signs of Alzheimer’s disease, while better physical and cognitive fitness has been linked to a lower epigenetic age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Black-box clocks&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But accuracy is a challenge for all aging clocks. Part of the problem lies in how they were designed. Most of the clocks were trained to link age with methylation. The best clocks will deliver an estimate that reflects how far a person’s biology deviates from the average. Aging clocks are still judged on how well they can predict a person’s chronological age, but you don’t want them to be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; close, says Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, head of machine learning at Shift Bioscience, who was awarded $10,000 by the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for developing a clock that could estimate age within a range of 2.55 years.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="a cartoon alarm clock shrugging" class="wp-image-1125411" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_Clock_final.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;None of the clocks are precise enough to predict the biological age of a single person.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Putting the same biological sample through five different clocks will give you five wildly different results.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;LEON EDLER&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s this paradox,” says Camillo. If a clock is really good at predicting chronological age, that’s all it will tell you—and it probably won’t reveal much about your biological age. No one needs an aging clock to tell them how many birthdays they’ve had. Camillo says he’s noticed that when the clocks get too close to “perfect” age prediction, they actually become less accurate at predicting mortality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Therein lies the other central issue for scientists who develop and use aging clocks: What is the thing they are really measuring? It is a difficult question for a field whose members notoriously fail to agree on the basics. (Everything from the definition of aging to how it occurs and why is up for debate among the experts.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;They do agree that aging is incredibly complex. A methylation-based aging clock might tell you about how that collection of chemical markers compares across individuals, but at best, it’s only giving you an idea of their “epigenetic age,” says Chandra. There are probably plenty of other biological markers that might reveal other aspects of aging, he says: “None of the clocks measure everything.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We don’t know why some methyl groups appear or disappear with age, either. Are these changes causing damage? Or are they a by-product of it? Are the epigenetic patterns seen in a 90-year-old a sign of deterioration? Or have they been responsible for keeping that person alive into very old age?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To make matters even more complicated, two different clocks can give similar answers by measuring methylation at entirely different regions of the genome. No one knows why, or which regions might be the best ones to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The biomarkers have this black-box quality,” says Jesse Poganik at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “Some of them are probably causal, some of them may be adaptive … and some of them may just be neutral”: either “there’s no reason for them not to happen” or “they just happen by random chance.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;What we know is that, as things stand, none of the clocks are precise enough to predict the biological age of a single person (sorry, Khloé). Putting the same biological sample through five different clocks will give you five wildly different results.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; clock can give you different answers if you put a sample through it more than once. “They’re not yet individually predictive,” says Herzog. “We don’t know what [a clock result] means for a person, [or if] they’re more or less likely to develop disease.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And it’s why plenty of aging researchers—even those who regularly use the clocks in their work—haven’t bothered to measure their own epigenetic age. “Let’s say I do a clock and it says that my biological age … is five years older than it should be,” says Magalhães. “So what?” He shrugs. “I don’t see much point in it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You might think this lack of clarity would make aging clocks pretty useless in a clinical setting. But plenty of clinics are offering them anyway. Some longevity clinics are more careful, and will regularly test their patients with a range of clocks, noting their results and tracking them over time. Others will simply offer an estimate of biological age as part of a longevity treatment package.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then there are the people who use aging clocks to sell supplements. While no drug or supplement has been definitively shown to make people live longer, that hasn’t stopped the lightly regulated wellness industry from pushing a range of “treatments” that range from lotions to herbal pills all the way through to stem-cell injections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of these people come to aging meetings. I was in the audience at an event when one CEO took to the stage to claim he had reversed his own biological age by 18 years—thanks to the supplement he was selling. Tom Weldon of Ponce de Leon Health told us his gray hair was turning brown. His biological age was supposedly reversing so rapidly that he had reached “longevity escape velocity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if the people who buy his supplements expect some kind of Benjamin Button effect, they might be disappointed. His company hasn’t yet conducted a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate any anti-aging effects of that supplement, called Rejuvant. Weldon says that such a trial would take years and cost millions of dollars, and that he’d “have to increase the price of our product more than four times” to pay for one. (The company has so far tested the active ingredient in mice and carried out a provisional trial in people.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More generally, Horvath says he “gets a bad taste in [his] mouth” when people use the clocks to sell products and “make a quick buck.” But he thinks that most of those sellers have genuine faith in both the clocks and their products. “People truly believe their own nonsense,” he says. “They are so passionate about what they discovered, they fall into this trap of believing [their] own prejudices.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The accuracy of the clocks is at a level that makes them useful for research, but not for individual predictions. Even if a clock did tell someone they were five years younger than their chronological age, that wouldn’t necessarily mean the person could expect to live five years longer, says Magalhães. “The field of aging has long been a rich ground for snake-oil salesmen and hype,” he says. “It comes with the territory.” (Weldon, for his part, says Rejuvant is the only product that has “clinically meaningful” claims.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In any case, Magalhães adds that he thinks any publicity is better than no publicity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And there’s the rub. Most people in the longevity field seem to have mixed feelings about the trendiness of aging clocks and how they are being used. They’ll agree that the clocks aren’t ready for consumer prime time, but they tend to appreciate the attention. Longevity research is expensive, after all. With a surge in funding and an explosion in the number of biotech companies working on longevity, aging scientists are hopeful that innovation and progress will follow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So they want to be sure that the reputation of aging clocks doesn’t end up being tarnished by association. Because while influencers and supplement sellers are using their “biological ages” to garner attention, scientists are now using these clocks to make some remarkable discoveries. Discoveries that are changing the way we think about aging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to be young again&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two little mice lie side by side, anesthetized and unconscious, as Jim White prepares his scalpel. The animals are of the same breed but look decidedly different. One is a youthful three-month-old, its fur thick, black, and glossy. By comparison, the second mouse, a 20-month-old, looks a little the worse for wear. Its fur is graying and patchy. Its whiskers are short, and it generally looks kind of frail.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the two mice are about to have a lot more in common. White, with some help from a colleague, makes incisions along the side of each mouse’s body and into the upper part of an arm and leg on the same side. He then carefully stitches the two animals together—membranes, fascia, and skin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The procedure takes around an hour, and the mice are then roused from their anesthesia. At first, the two still-groggy animals pull away from each other. But within a few days, they seem to have accepted that they now share their bodies. Soon their circulatory systems will fuse, and the animals will share a blood flow too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="cartoon man in profile with a stick of a wrist watch around a lit stick of dynamite in his mouth" class="wp-image-1125412" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_Dynamite_final.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“People are complicated. There’s a huge error bar.” — Steve Horvath, former biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;LEON EDLER&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;White, who studies aging at Duke University, has been stitching mice together for years; he has performed this strange procedure, known as heterochronic parabiosis, more than a hundred times. And he’s seen a curious phenomenon occur. The older mice appear to benefit from the arrangement. They seem to &lt;em&gt;get younger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Experiments with heterochronic parabiosis have been performed for decades, but typically scientists keep the mice attached to each other for only a few weeks, says White. In their experiment, he and his colleagues left the mice attached for three months—equivalent to around 10 human years. The team then carefully separated the animals to assess how each of them had fared. “You’d think that they’d want to separate immediately,” says White. “But when you detach them … they kind of follow each other around.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The most striking result of that experiment was that the older mice who had been attached to a younger mouse ended up living longer than other mice of a similar age. “[They lived] around 10% longer, but [they] also maintained a lot of [their] function,” says White. They were more active and maintained their strength for longer, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When his colleagues, including Poganik, applied aging clocks to the mice, they found that their epigenetic ages were lower than expected. “The young circulation slowed aging in the old mice,” says White. The effect seemed to last, too—at least for a little while. “It preserved that youthful state for longer than we expected,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The young mice went the other way and appeared biologically older, both while they were attached to the old mice and shortly after they were detached. But in their case, the effect seemed to be short-lived, says White: “The young mice went back to being young again.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To White, this suggests that something about the “youthful state” might be programmed in some way. That perhaps it is written into our DNA. Maybe we don’t have to go through the biological process of aging.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This gets at a central debate in the aging field: What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; aging, and why does it happen? Some believe it’s simply a result of accumulated damage. Some believe that the aging process is programmed; just as we grow limbs, develop a brain, reach puberty, and experience menopause, we are destined to deteriorate. Others think programs that play an important role in our early development just turn out to be harmful later in life by chance. And there are some scientists who agree with all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;White’s theory is that being old is just “a loss of youth,” he says. If that’s the case, there’s a silver lining: Knowing how youth is lost might point toward a way to somehow regain it, perhaps by restoring those youthful programs in some way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dogs and dolphins&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Horvath’s eponymous clock was developed by measuring methylation in DNA samples taken from tissues around the body. It seems to represent aging in all these tissues, which is why Horvath calls it a pan-tissue clock. Given that our organs are thought to age differently, it was remarkable that a single clock could measure aging in so many of them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Horvath had ambitious plans for an even more universal clock: a &lt;em&gt;pan-species&lt;/em&gt; model that could measure aging in all mammals. He started out, in 2017, with an email campaign that involved asking hundreds of scientists around the world to share samples of tissues from animals they had worked with. He tried zoos, too.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging—not just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I learned that people had spent careers collecting [animal] tissues,” he says. “They had freezers full of [them].” Amenable scientists would ship those frozen tissues, or just DNA, to Horvath’s lab in California, where he would use them to train a new model.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Horvath says he initially set out to profile 30 different species. But he ended up receiving around 15,000 samples from 200 scientists, representing 348 species—including everything from dogs to dolphins. Could a single clock really predict age in all of them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I truly felt it would fail,” says Horvath. “But it turned out that I was completely wrong.” He and his colleagues developed a clock that assessed methylation at 36,000 locations on the genome. The result, which was published in 2023 as the pan-mammalian clock, can estimate the age of any mammal and even the maximum lifespan of the species. The data set is open to anyone who wants to download it, he adds: “I hope people will mine the data to find the secret of how to extend a healthy lifespan.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging—not just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Comparisons between mammals also support the idea that the slower methylation changes occur, the longer the lifespan of the animal, says Nelly Olova, an epigeneticist who researches aging at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. “DNA methylation slowly erodes with age,” she says. “We still have the instructions in place, but they become a little messier.” The research in different mammals suggests that cells can take only so much change before they stop functioning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s a finite amount of change that the cell can tolerate,” she says. “If the instructions become too messy and noisy … it cannot support life.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Olova has been investigating exactly when aging clocks first begin to tick—in other words, the point at which aging starts. Clocks can be trained on data from volunteers, and by matching the patterns of methylation on their DNA to their chronological age. The trained clocks are then typically used to estimate the biological age of adults. But they can also be used on samples from children. Or babies. They can be used to work out the biological age of cells that make up embryos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In her research, Olova used adult skin cells, which—thanks to Nobel Prize–winning research in the 2000s—can be “reprogrammed” back to a state resembling that of the pluripotent stem cells found in embryos. When Olova and her colleagues used a “partial reprogramming” approach to take cells close to that state, they found that the closer they got to the entirely reprogrammed state, the “younger” the cells were.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was around 20 days after the cells had been reprogrammed into stem cells that they reached the biological age of zero according to the clock used, says Olova. “It was a bit surreal,” she says. “The pluripotent cells measure as &lt;em&gt;minus &lt;/em&gt;0.5; they’re slightly below zero.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vadim Gladyshev, a prominent aging researcher at Harvard University, has since proposed that the same negative level of aging might apply to embryos. After all, some kind of rejuvenation happens during the early stages of embryo formation—an aged egg cell and an aged sperm cell somehow create a brand-new cell. The slate is wiped clean.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gladyshev calls this point “ground zero.” He posits that it’s reached sometime during the “mid-embryonic state.” At this point, aging begins. And so does “organismal life,” he argues. “It’s interesting how this coincides with philosophical questions about when life starts,” says Olova.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some have argued that life begins when sperm meets egg, while others have suggested that the point when embryonic cells start to form some kind of unified structure is what counts. The ground zero point is when the body plan is set out and cells begin to organize accordingly, she says. “Before that, it’s just a bunch of cells.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that life begins at the embryonic state, but it does suggest that this is when aging begins—perhaps as the result of “a generational clearance of damage,” says Poganik.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is early days—no pun intended—for this research, and the science is far from settled. But knowing when aging begins could help inform attempts to rewind the clock. If scientists can pinpoint an ideal biological age for cells, perhaps they can find ways to get old cells back to that state. There might be a way to slow aging once cells reach a certain biological age, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Presumably, there may be opportunities for targeting aging before … you’re full of gray hair,” says Poganik. “It could mean that there is an ideal window for intervention which is much earlier than our current geriatrics-based approach.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When young meets old&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When White first started stitching mice together, he would sit and watch them for hours. “I was like, look at them go! They’re together, and they don’t even care!” he says. Since then, he’s learned a few tricks. He tends to work with female mice, for instance—the males tend to bicker and nip at each other, he says. The females, on the other hand, seem to get on well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The effect their partnership appears to have on their biological ages, if only temporarily, is among the ways aging clocks are helping us understand that biological age is plastic to some degree. White and his colleagues have also found, for instance, that stress seems to increase biological age, but that the effect can be reversed once the stress stops. Both pregnancy and covid-19 infections have a similar reversible effect.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Poganik wonders if this finding might have applications for human organ transplants. Perhaps there’s a way to measure the biological age of an organ before it is transplanted and somehow rejuvenate organs before surgery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But new data from aging clocks suggests that this might be more complicated than it sounds. Poganik and his colleagues have been using methylation clocks to measure the biological age of samples taken from recently transplanted hearts in living people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If being old is simply a case of losing our youthfulness, then that might give us a clue to how we can somehow regain it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Young hearts do well in older bodies, but the biological age of these organs eventually creeps up to match that of their recipient. The same is true for older hearts in younger bodies, says Poganik, who has not yet published his findings. “After a few months, the tissue may assimilate the biological age of the organism,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If that’s the case, the benefits of young organs might be short-lived. It also suggests that scientists working on ways to rejuvenate individual organs may need to focus their anti-aging efforts on more systemic means of rejuvenation—for example, stem cells that repopulate the blood. Reprogramming these cells to a youthful state, perhaps one a little closer to “ground zero,” might be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whole-body rejuvenation might be some way off, but scientists are still hopeful that aging clocks might help them find a way to reverse aging in people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We have the machinery to reset our epigenetic clock to a more youthful state,” says White. “That means we have the ability to turn the clock backwards.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/14/1124977/aging-clocks-biology-mortality-longevity/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Can we repair the internet?

Books by three influential figures—the intellect behind “net neutrality,” a former Meta executive, and the web’s own inventor—propose radical approaches to fixing it. But are these luminaries the right people for the job? Though each shows conviction, and even sometimes inventiveness, the solutions they present reveal blind spots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="book cover" class="wp-image-1125432" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/book.wu_.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Age of Extraction: How Tech Platforms Conquered the Economy and Threaten Our Future Prosperity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Wu&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;KNOPF, 2025&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Age of Extraction: How Tech Platforms Conquered the Economy and Threaten Our Future Prosperity,&lt;/em&gt; Tim Wu argues that a few platform companies have too much concentrated power and must be dismantled. Wu, a prominent Columbia professor who popularized the principle that a free internet requires all online traffic to be treated equally, believes that existing legal mechanisms, especially anti-monopoly laws, offer the best way to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pairing economic theory with recent digital history, Wu shows how platforms have shifted from giving &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; users to extracting &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; them. He argues that our failure to understand their power has only encouraged them to grow, displacing competitors along the way. And he contends that convenience is what platforms most often exploit to keep users entrapped. “The human desire to avoid unnecessary pain and inconvenience,” he writes, may be “the strongest force out there.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He cites Google’s and Apple’s “ecosystems” as examples, showing how users can become dependent on such services as a result of their all-­encompassing seamlessness. To Wu, this isn’t a bad thing in itself. The ease of using Amazon to stream entertainment, make online purchases, or help organize day-to-day life delivers obvious gains. But when powerhouse companies like Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet win the battle of convenience with so many users—and never let competitors get a foothold—the result is “industry dominance” that must now be reexamined.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The measures Wu advocates—and that appear the most practical, as they draw on existing legal frameworks and economic policies—are federal anti-monopoly laws, utility caps that limit how much companies can charge consumers for service, and “line of business” restrictions that prohibit companies from operating in certain industries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Columbia University’s Tim Wu shows how platforms have shifted from giving &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; users to extracting &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; them. He argues that our failure to understand their power has only encouraged them to grow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anti-monopoly provisions and antitrust laws are effective weapons in our armory, Wu contends, pointing out that they have been successfully used against technology companies in the past. He cites two well-known cases. The first is the 1960s antitrust case brought by the US government against IBM, which helped create competition in the computer software market that enabled companies like Apple and Microsoft to emerge. The 1982 AT&amp;amp;T case that broke the telephone conglomerate up into several smaller companies is another instance. In each, the public benefited from the decoupling of hardware, software, and other services, leading to more competition and choice in a technology market.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But will past performance predict future results? It’s not yet clear whether these laws can be successful in the platform age. The 2025 antitrust case against Google—in which a judge ruled that the company did not have to divest itself of its Chrome browser as the US Justice Department had proposed—reveals the limits of pursuing tech breakups through the law. The 2001 antitrust case brought against Microsoft likewise failed to separate the company from its web browser and mostly kept the conglomerate intact. Wu noticeably doesn’t discuss the Microsoft case when arguing for antitrust action today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nick Clegg, until recently Meta’s president of global affairs and a former deputy prime minister of the UK, takes a position very different from Wu’s: that trying to break up the biggest tech companies is misguided and would degrade the experience of internet users. In &lt;em&gt;How to Save the Internet: The Threat to Global Connection in the Age of AI and Political Conflict,&lt;/em&gt; Clegg acknowledges Big Tech’s monopoly over the web. But he believes punitive legal measures like antitrust laws are unproductive and can be avoided by means of regulation, such as rules for what content social media can and can’t publish. (It’s worth noting that Meta is facing its own antitrust case, involving whether it should have been allowed to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="book cover" class="wp-image-1125430" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/book.clegg_.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Save the Internet: The Threat to Global Connection in the Age of AI and Political Conflict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;BODLEY HEAD, 2025&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clegg also believes Silicon Valley should take the initiative to reform itself. He argues that encouraging social media networks to “open up the books” and share their decision-making power with users is more likely to restore some equilibrium than contemplating legal action as a first resort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But some may be skeptical of a former Meta exec and politician who worked closely with Mark Zuckerberg and still wasn’t able to usher in such changes to social media sites while working for one. What will only compound this skepticism is the selective history found in Clegg’s book, which briefly acknowledges some scandals (like the one surrounding Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting from Facebook users in 2016) but refuses to discuss other pertinent ones. For example, Clegg laments the “fractured” nature of the global internet today but fails to acknowledge Facebook’s own role in this splintering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Breaking up Big Tech through antitrust laws would hinder innovation, says Clegg, arguing that the idea “completely ignores the benefits users gain from large network effects.” Users stick with these outsize channels because they can find “most of what they’re looking for,” he writes, like friends and content on social media and cheap consumer goods on Amazon and eBay.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wu might concede this point, but he would disagree with Clegg’s claims that maintaining the status quo is beneficial to users. “The traditional logic of antitrust law doesn’t work,” Clegg insists. Instead, he believes less sweeping regulation can help make Big Tech less dangerous while ensuring a better user experience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clegg has seen both sides of the regulatory coin: He worked in David Cameron’s government passing national laws for technology companies to follow and then moved to Meta to help the company navigate those types of nation-specific obligations. He bemoans the hassle and complexity Silicon Valley faces in trying to comply with differing rules across the globe, some set by “American federal agencies” and others by “Indian nationalists.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But with the resources such companies command, surely they are more than equipped to cope? Given that Meta itself has previously meddled in access to the internet (such as in India, whose telecommunications regulator ultimately blocked its Free Basics internet service for violating net neutrality rules), this complaint seems suspect coming from Clegg. What should be the real priority, he argues, is not any new nation-specific laws but a global “treaty that protects the free flow of data between signatory countries.”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the former Meta executive Nick Clegg advocates—unsurprisingly—is not a breakup of Big Tech but a push for it to become “radically transparent.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clegg believes that these nation-specific technology obligations—a recent one is Australia’s ban on social media for people under 16—usually reflect fallacies about the technology’s human impact, a subject that can be fraught with anxiety. Such laws have proved ineffective and tend to taint the public’s understanding of social networks, he says. There is some truth to his argument here, but reading a book in which a former Facebook executive dismisses techno-determinism—that is, the argument that technology makes people do or think certain things—may be cold comfort to those who have seen the harm technology can do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In any case, Clegg’s defensiveness about social networks may not gain much favor from users themselves. He stresses the need for more personal responsibility, arguing that Meta doesn’t ever intend for users to stay on Facebook or Instagram endlessly: “How long you spend on the app in a single session is not nearly as important as getting you to come back over and over again.” Social media companies want to serve you content that is “meaningful to you,” he claims, not “simply to give you a momentary dopamine spike.” All this feels disingenuous at best.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What Clegg advocates—unsurprisingly—is not a breakup of Big Tech but a push for it to become “radically transparent,” whether on its own or, if necessary, with the help of federal legislators. He also wants platforms to bring users more into their governance processes (by using Facebook’s model of community forums to help improve their apps and products, for example). Finally, Clegg also wants Big Tech to give users more meaningful control of their data and how companies such as Meta can use it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here Clegg shares common ground with the inventor of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, whose own proposal for reform advances a technically specific vision for doing just that. In his memoir/manifesto &lt;em&gt;This Is for Everyone: The Unfinished Story of the World Wide Web,&lt;/em&gt; Berners-Lee acknowledges that his initial vision—of a technology he hoped would remain open-source, collaborative, and completely decentralized—is a far cry from the web that we know today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="book cover" class="wp-image-1125431" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/book.lee_.jpg?w=1325" width="1325" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Is for Everyone: The Unfinished Story of the World Wide Web&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;FARRAR, STRAUS &amp;amp; GIROUX, 2025&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there’s any surviving manifestation of his original project, he says, it’s Wikipedia, which remains “probably the best single example of what I wanted the web to be.” His best idea for moving power from Silicon Valley platforms into the hands of users is to give them more data control. He pushes for a universal data “pod” he helped develop, known as “Solid” (an abbreviation of “social linked data”).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The system—which was originally developed at MIT—would offer a central site where people could manage data ranging from credit card information to health records to social media comment history. “Rather than have all this stuff siloed off with different providers across the web, you’d be able to store your entire digital information trail in a single private repository,” Berners-Lee writes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Solid product may look like a kind of silver bullet in an age when data harvesting is familiar and data breaches are rampant. Placing greater control with users and enabling them to see “what data [i]s being generated about them” does sound like a tantalizing prospect.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But some people may have concerns about, for example, merging their confidential health records with data from personal devices (like heart rate info from a smart watch). No matter how much user control and decentralization Berners-Lee may promise, recent data scandals (such as cases in which period-tracking apps misused clients’ data) may be on people’s minds.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee believes that centralizing user data in a product like Solid could save people time and improve daily life on the internet. “An alien coming to Earth would think it was very strange that I had to tell my phone the same things again and again,” he complains about the experience of using different airline apps today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With Solid, everything from vaccination records to credit card transactions could be kept within the digital vault and plugged into different apps. Berners-Lee believes that AI could also help people make more use of this data—for example, by linking meal plans to grocery bills. Still, if he’s optimistic on how AI and Solid could coordinate to improve users’ lives, he is vague on how to make sure that chatbots manage such personal data sensitively and safely.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee generally opposes regulation of the web (except in the case of teenagers and social media algorithms, where he sees a genuine need). He believes in internet users’ individual right to control their own data; he is confident that a product like Solid could “course-correct” the web from its current “exploitative” and extractive direction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of the three writers’ approaches to reform, it is Wu’s that has shown &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; effectiveness of late. Companies like Google have been forced to give competitors some advantage through data sharing, and they have now seen limits on how their systems can be used in new products and technologies. But in the current US political climate, will antitrust laws continue to be enforced against Big Tech?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clegg may get his way on one issue: limiting new nation-specific laws. President Donald Trump has confirmed that he will use tariffs to penalize countries that ratify their own national laws targeting US tech companies. And given the posture of the Trump administration, it doesn’t seem likely that Big Tech will see more regulation in the US. Indeed, social networks have seemed emboldened (Meta, for example, removed fact-checkers and relaxed content moderation rules after Trump’s election win). In any case, the US hasn’t passed a major piece of federal internet legislation since 1996.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If using anti-monopoly laws through the courts isn’t possible, Clegg’s push for a US-led omnibus deal—setting consensual rules for data and acceptable standards of human rights—may be the only way to make some more immediate improvements.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, there is not likely to be any single fix for what ails the internet today. But the ideas the three writers agree on—greater user control, more data privacy, and increased accountability from Silicon Valley—are surely the outcomes we should all fight for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nathan Smith is a writer whose work has appeared in the &lt;/em&gt;Washington Post,&lt;em&gt; the &lt;/em&gt;Economist,&lt;em&gt; and the &lt;/em&gt;Los Angeles Times.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;From addictive algorithms to exploitative apps, data mining to misinformation, the internet today can be a hazardous place. Books by three influential figures—the intellect behind “net neutrality,” a former Meta executive, and the web’s own inventor—propose radical approaches to fixing it. But are these luminaries the right people for the job? Though each shows conviction, and even sometimes inventiveness, the solutions they present reveal blind spots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="book cover" class="wp-image-1125432" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/book.wu_.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Age of Extraction: How Tech Platforms Conquered the Economy and Threaten Our Future Prosperity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Wu&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;KNOPF, 2025&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Age of Extraction: How Tech Platforms Conquered the Economy and Threaten Our Future Prosperity,&lt;/em&gt; Tim Wu argues that a few platform companies have too much concentrated power and must be dismantled. Wu, a prominent Columbia professor who popularized the principle that a free internet requires all online traffic to be treated equally, believes that existing legal mechanisms, especially anti-monopoly laws, offer the best way to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pairing economic theory with recent digital history, Wu shows how platforms have shifted from giving &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; users to extracting &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; them. He argues that our failure to understand their power has only encouraged them to grow, displacing competitors along the way. And he contends that convenience is what platforms most often exploit to keep users entrapped. “The human desire to avoid unnecessary pain and inconvenience,” he writes, may be “the strongest force out there.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He cites Google’s and Apple’s “ecosystems” as examples, showing how users can become dependent on such services as a result of their all-­encompassing seamlessness. To Wu, this isn’t a bad thing in itself. The ease of using Amazon to stream entertainment, make online purchases, or help organize day-to-day life delivers obvious gains. But when powerhouse companies like Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet win the battle of convenience with so many users—and never let competitors get a foothold—the result is “industry dominance” that must now be reexamined.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The measures Wu advocates—and that appear the most practical, as they draw on existing legal frameworks and economic policies—are federal anti-monopoly laws, utility caps that limit how much companies can charge consumers for service, and “line of business” restrictions that prohibit companies from operating in certain industries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Columbia University’s Tim Wu shows how platforms have shifted from giving &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; users to extracting &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; them. He argues that our failure to understand their power has only encouraged them to grow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anti-monopoly provisions and antitrust laws are effective weapons in our armory, Wu contends, pointing out that they have been successfully used against technology companies in the past. He cites two well-known cases. The first is the 1960s antitrust case brought by the US government against IBM, which helped create competition in the computer software market that enabled companies like Apple and Microsoft to emerge. The 1982 AT&amp;amp;T case that broke the telephone conglomerate up into several smaller companies is another instance. In each, the public benefited from the decoupling of hardware, software, and other services, leading to more competition and choice in a technology market.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But will past performance predict future results? It’s not yet clear whether these laws can be successful in the platform age. The 2025 antitrust case against Google—in which a judge ruled that the company did not have to divest itself of its Chrome browser as the US Justice Department had proposed—reveals the limits of pursuing tech breakups through the law. The 2001 antitrust case brought against Microsoft likewise failed to separate the company from its web browser and mostly kept the conglomerate intact. Wu noticeably doesn’t discuss the Microsoft case when arguing for antitrust action today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nick Clegg, until recently Meta’s president of global affairs and a former deputy prime minister of the UK, takes a position very different from Wu’s: that trying to break up the biggest tech companies is misguided and would degrade the experience of internet users. In &lt;em&gt;How to Save the Internet: The Threat to Global Connection in the Age of AI and Political Conflict,&lt;/em&gt; Clegg acknowledges Big Tech’s monopoly over the web. But he believes punitive legal measures like antitrust laws are unproductive and can be avoided by means of regulation, such as rules for what content social media can and can’t publish. (It’s worth noting that Meta is facing its own antitrust case, involving whether it should have been allowed to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="book cover" class="wp-image-1125430" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/book.clegg_.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Save the Internet: The Threat to Global Connection in the Age of AI and Political Conflict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;BODLEY HEAD, 2025&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clegg also believes Silicon Valley should take the initiative to reform itself. He argues that encouraging social media networks to “open up the books” and share their decision-making power with users is more likely to restore some equilibrium than contemplating legal action as a first resort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But some may be skeptical of a former Meta exec and politician who worked closely with Mark Zuckerberg and still wasn’t able to usher in such changes to social media sites while working for one. What will only compound this skepticism is the selective history found in Clegg’s book, which briefly acknowledges some scandals (like the one surrounding Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting from Facebook users in 2016) but refuses to discuss other pertinent ones. For example, Clegg laments the “fractured” nature of the global internet today but fails to acknowledge Facebook’s own role in this splintering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Breaking up Big Tech through antitrust laws would hinder innovation, says Clegg, arguing that the idea “completely ignores the benefits users gain from large network effects.” Users stick with these outsize channels because they can find “most of what they’re looking for,” he writes, like friends and content on social media and cheap consumer goods on Amazon and eBay.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wu might concede this point, but he would disagree with Clegg’s claims that maintaining the status quo is beneficial to users. “The traditional logic of antitrust law doesn’t work,” Clegg insists. Instead, he believes less sweeping regulation can help make Big Tech less dangerous while ensuring a better user experience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clegg has seen both sides of the regulatory coin: He worked in David Cameron’s government passing national laws for technology companies to follow and then moved to Meta to help the company navigate those types of nation-specific obligations. He bemoans the hassle and complexity Silicon Valley faces in trying to comply with differing rules across the globe, some set by “American federal agencies” and others by “Indian nationalists.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But with the resources such companies command, surely they are more than equipped to cope? Given that Meta itself has previously meddled in access to the internet (such as in India, whose telecommunications regulator ultimately blocked its Free Basics internet service for violating net neutrality rules), this complaint seems suspect coming from Clegg. What should be the real priority, he argues, is not any new nation-specific laws but a global “treaty that protects the free flow of data between signatory countries.”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the former Meta executive Nick Clegg advocates—unsurprisingly—is not a breakup of Big Tech but a push for it to become “radically transparent.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clegg believes that these nation-specific technology obligations—a recent one is Australia’s ban on social media for people under 16—usually reflect fallacies about the technology’s human impact, a subject that can be fraught with anxiety. Such laws have proved ineffective and tend to taint the public’s understanding of social networks, he says. There is some truth to his argument here, but reading a book in which a former Facebook executive dismisses techno-determinism—that is, the argument that technology makes people do or think certain things—may be cold comfort to those who have seen the harm technology can do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In any case, Clegg’s defensiveness about social networks may not gain much favor from users themselves. He stresses the need for more personal responsibility, arguing that Meta doesn’t ever intend for users to stay on Facebook or Instagram endlessly: “How long you spend on the app in a single session is not nearly as important as getting you to come back over and over again.” Social media companies want to serve you content that is “meaningful to you,” he claims, not “simply to give you a momentary dopamine spike.” All this feels disingenuous at best.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What Clegg advocates—unsurprisingly—is not a breakup of Big Tech but a push for it to become “radically transparent,” whether on its own or, if necessary, with the help of federal legislators. He also wants platforms to bring users more into their governance processes (by using Facebook’s model of community forums to help improve their apps and products, for example). Finally, Clegg also wants Big Tech to give users more meaningful control of their data and how companies such as Meta can use it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here Clegg shares common ground with the inventor of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, whose own proposal for reform advances a technically specific vision for doing just that.

The move underscores the company’s push to stay competitive as AI becomes central to enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded and headquartered in San Francisco since 1999, Salesforce has been adding AI features across its products, including the workplace messaging tool Slack. The company is competing with ServiceNow, Oracle, and Microsoft to attract organisations eager to integrate AI into their operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the new investment will fund an AI incubator on Salesforce’s San Francisco campus and help companies deploy AI agents — digital assistants that can handle tasks for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This $15 billion investment reflects our deep commitment to our hometown — advancing AI innovation, creating jobs and helping companies and our communities thrive,” said CEO Marc Benioff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes just before Dreamforce, Salesforce’s annual conference, which runs from October 14 to 16 in San Francisco. The company expects around 50,000 people to attend and estimates the event will bring in about $130 million in local revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce, which employs more than 76,000 people worldwide, also announced last week that it will spend $1 billion in Mexico over the next five years. The company has operated there since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff said the new spending aligns with the company’s long-term goals. “If the company wants to remain a leader in an important emerging technology area, it must have a pipeline of talent to innovate and drive the field forward. We already see shortages of AI talent, so this makes sense,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce shares rose 2.8% on Monday but remain down about 28% since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same day, Salesforce also launched Agentforce 360, a new AI platform for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many companies are still experimenting with AI-driven automation, Salesforce says it has already rolled out multiple versions of its “agentic” technology, used by thousands of customers and within its own operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company describes the “Agentic Enterprise” as a workplace model where AI supports people rather than replaces them. In this setup, AI agents help teams respond faster, track leads, provide continuous service, and make better decisions.

The move underscores the company’s push to stay competitive as AI becomes central to enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded and headquartered in San Francisco since 1999, Salesforce has been adding AI features across its products, including the workplace messaging tool Slack. The company is competing with ServiceNow, Oracle, and Microsoft to attract organisations eager to integrate AI into their operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the new investment will fund an AI incubator on Salesforce’s San Francisco campus and help companies deploy AI agents — digital assistants that can handle tasks for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This $15 billion investment reflects our deep commitment to our hometown — advancing AI innovation, creating jobs and helping companies and our communities thrive,” said CEO Marc Benioff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes just before Dreamforce, Salesforce’s annual conference, which runs from October 14 to 16 in San Francisco. The company expects around 50,000 people to attend and estimates the event will bring in about $130 million in local revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce, which employs more than 76,000 people worldwide, also announced last week that it will spend $1 billion in Mexico over the next five years. The company has operated there since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff said the new spending aligns with the company’s long-term goals. “If the company wants to remain a leader in an important emerging technology area, it must have a pipeline of talent to innovate and drive the field forward. We already see shortages of AI talent, so this makes sense,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce shares rose 2.8% on Monday but remain down about 28% since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same day, Salesforce also launched Agentforce 360, a new AI platform for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many companies are still experimenting with AI-driven automation, Salesforce says it has already rolled out multiple versions of its “agentic” technology, used by thousands of customers and within its own operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company describes the “Agentic Enterprise” as a workplace model where AI supports people rather than replaces them. In this setup, AI agents help teams respond faster, track leads, provide continuous service, and make better decisions. The goal, Salesforce says, is to boost productivity and customer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentforce 360 combines four key parts of this model:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentforce 360 Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; A framework for building enterprise AI agents, now featuring a conversational builder, hybrid reasoning for more accurate results, and voice support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data 360:&lt;/strong&gt; A unified data layer that gives AI systems the context they need.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, Google said it would build the data center in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, in the port city of Visakhapatnam. The investment will take place over the next five years through 2030, the company added. Notably, this marks Google’s largest investment in India and comes five years after it first announced a $10 billion commitment to the South Asian nation in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Weeks after President Donald Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Indian imports in August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi began urging the use of “swadeshi” (Hindi for “made in India”) products. In response, Indian lawmakers and ministries started promoting local alternatives to Google — including those from Chennai-based enterprise tech firm Zoho Corporation, which offers competitors to Google Cloud and Gmail, and most recently, WhatsApp-rival Arattai, as well as MapMyIndia, a Google Maps-rival. While the initial impact has been limited, these moves could pose a real political threat to the future of companies Google and Microsoft in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google has 14,000 employees in India, and has operated in the country for 21 years. The company also counts Delhi and Mumbai as official cloud regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new Google AI hub will be the company’s largest investment outside of the U.S., said Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, adding that it would be scaled to “multiple gigawatts” over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It is part of a global network of AI centers in 12 different countries,” Kurian said at the launch of the AI hub in New Delhi. “In addition to that, we’re also pleased to announce that we will be making Vishakhapatnam a global connectivity hub.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google also announced plans to bring its subsea cable infrastructure to Visakhapatnam. The U.S. tech giant has partnered with Indian telecom provider Bharti Airtel to build both the data center and the cable landing station in the city. Further, Google has teamed up with Adani Group-backed AdaniConneX to set up the infrastructure for the data center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We see it not just becoming a landing station for a large number of cables, but also providing a digital backbone connecting different parts of India together,” Kurian said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google said the AI hub will offer a “full stack of solutions,” including its custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to enable local AI processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Mountain View–based company will also provide access to its AI models — including Gemini — and its platform for building agents and applications. The hub will additionally support consumer services such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, and Google Ads.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We see this hub not just serving India but from India serving Asia and other parts of the world,” Kurian said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s choice of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh is not surprising. The southern state, under Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, has previously attracted global tech firms like Oracle and Microsoft to set up hubs in Hyderabad, which was Andhra Pradesh’s capital before the creation of Telangana. Naidu, a key political ally who supported Prime Minister Modi’s return to power in the last general election, has since played a prominent role in shaping national policy discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This AI hub will be a very important contribution to the [India] AI mission goals in different ways,” said Indian IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The minister urged Google to consider India’s Andaman Islands as the next major hub for global internet data transfer, noting that Singapore “is all choked,” and assured the company of full government support. He also proposed linking Visakhapatnam with Sittwe, a city in Myanmar, to improve connectivity in India’s northeastern states.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google is making a $15 billion investment to set up a 1-gigawatt data center and AI hub in India, even as the Indian government pushes for reduced reliance on U.S. tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;

It turns out that just 13 percent globally are actually prepared for the AI revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this small group – which Cisco calls the ‘Pacesetters’ – are lapping the competition. The third annual Cisco AI Readiness Index found these top performers are four times more likely to get their AI projects out of the pilot stage and into the real world. More importantly, they are 50 percent more likely to see measurable value from their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they’ve figured out is that winning with AI is about getting the foundations right with a disciplined approach that weaves together strategy, infrastructure, and security. And it pays off, with 90 percent of these Pacesetters seeing real gains in profit, productivity, and innovation, while most of their peers are hovering around the 60 percent mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeetu Patel, Cisco’s President and Chief Product Officer, said: “This year’s Cisco AI Readiness Index makes one thing clear: AI doesn’t fail, readiness fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most AI-ready organisations – the Pacesetters from our research – prove it. They’re four times more likely to move pilots into production and 50 percent more likely to realise measurable value. So, with more than 80 percent of organisations we surveyed about to deploy AI agents, these new findings confirm readiness, discipline, and action are key to unlocking value.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s their secret? The research shows a clear pattern. Pacesetters don’t treat AI as a side project; it’s a core part of their business strategy. Almost every single one of them (99%) has a proper AI roadmap, something only 58 percent of other companies can claim. They also put their money where their mouth is. For 79 percent of them, AI is the top investment priority, a commitment shared by only 24 percent of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These leaders are building for the long haul, with 98 percent designing their networks to handle the immense scale and complexity of AI, compared to just 46 percent of their peers. It gives them the confidence that their systems can handle whatever is thrown at them; 71 percent say their networks can scale instantly for any AI project, a feeling shared by a worryingly low 15 percent of other organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also gives us a glimpse into the near future, and for many, it looks rocky. Two huge challenges are looming: the widespread use of AI agents and a problem Cisco has dubbed ‘AI Infrastructure Debt’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;83 percent of companies are planning to deploy AI agents as part of their strategy, with nearly 40 percent expecting them to be working alongside human employees within a year. But here’s the problem: most of these firms are trying to build on shaky ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over half of companies admitted their current networks simply can’t handle the data volumes or complexity that these advanced AI systems demand. The Pacesetters, on the other hand, have already done their homework, with 75 percent feeling fully equipped to secure and control these agents, compared to just 31 percent of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leads us to the ticking time bomb of ‘AI Infrastructure Debt’. Think of it as the modern version of the technical debt that plagued companies for years. It’s the result of all the compromises, postponed upgrades, and underfunded plans that quietly pile up, slowly strangling the long-term value of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning signs are already flashing. Nearly two-thirds of leaders expect their workloads to jump by over 30 percent in the next three years, and a similar number are struggling just to get their data organised in one place. Add to that the fact that only a quarter have enough GPU power, and you see a massive gap between ambition and reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson from Cisco’s report is clear and simple: value follows readiness. In the race to adopt AI, the Pacesetters have shown that the organisations that take the time to build a strong foundation to support their strategy are the ones that will pull away from the pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gemini Enterprise: Google aims to put an AI agent on every desk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-109805" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging.

A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging, might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn’t have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. And what they’ve found is changing our understanding of aging itself. Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Jessica Hamzelou&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we repair the internet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;From addictive algorithms to exploitative apps, data mining to misinformation, the internet today can be a hazardous place. New books by three influential figures—the intellect behind “net neutrality,” a former Meta executive, and the web’s own inventor—propose radical approaches to fixing it. But are these luminaries the right people for the job?

Cyclic Materials aims to change that by opening one of the largest rare earth magnet recycling operations outside of China next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By collecting a wide range of devices and recycling multiple metals, the company seeks to overcome the economic challenges that have long held back such efforts.
