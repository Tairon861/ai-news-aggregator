            &lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) excel at using textual reasoning to understand the context of a document and provide a logical answer about its contents. But these same LLMs often struggle to correctly answer even the simplest math problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Textual reasoning is usually a less-than-ideal way to deliberate over computational or algorithmic tasks. While some LLMs can generate code like Python to handle symbolic queries, the models don’t always know when to use code, or what kind of code would work best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs, it seems, may need a coach to steer them toward the best technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter CodeSteer, a smart assistant developed by MIT researchers that guides an LLM to switch between code and text generation until it correctly answers a query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CodeSteer, itself a smaller LLM, automatically generates a series of prompts to iteratively steer a larger LLM. It reviews the model’s current and previous answers after each round and provides guidance for how it can fix or refine that solution until it deems the answer is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that augmenting a larger LLM with CodeSteer boosted its accuracy on symbolic tasks, like multiplying numbers, playing Sudoku, and stacking blocks, by more than 30 percent. It also enabled less sophisticated models to outperform more advanced models with enhanced reasoning skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advance could improve the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs for complex tasks that are especially difficult to solve with textual reasoning alone, such as generating paths for robots in uncertain environments or scheduling shipments in an international supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a race to develop better and better models that are capable of doing everything, but we’ve taken a complementary approach. Researchers have spent years developing effective technologies and tools to tackle problems in many domains. We want to enable LLMs to select the right tools and methods, and make use of others’ expertise to enhance their own capabilities,” says Chuchu Fan, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics (AeroAstro) and principal investigator in the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fan, the senior author of the study, is joined on a paper about the work by LIDS graduate student Yongchao Chen; AeroAstro graduate student Yilun Hao; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign graduate student Yueying Liu; and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab Research Scientist Yang Zhang. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An LLM “trainer”&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask an LLM which number is bigger, 9.11 or 9.9, and it will often give the wrong answer by using textual reasoning. But ask it to use code to answer the same question, and it can generate and execute a Python script to compare the two numbers, easily solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially trained to understand and predict human language, LLMs are more likely to answer queries using text, even when code would be more effective. And while they have learned to generate code through fine-tuning, these models often generate an incorrect or less efficient version of the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to retrain a powerful LLM like GPT-4 or Claude to improve these capabilities, the MIT researchers fine-tune a smaller, lightweight LLM to guide a larger model between text and code. Fine-tuning a smaller model doesn’t change the larger LLM, so there is no risk it would undermine the larger model’s other abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were also inspired by humans. In sports, a trainer may not be better than the star athlete on the team, but the trainer can still give helpful suggestions to guide the athlete. This steering method works for LLMs, too,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trainer, CodeSteer, works in conjunction with the larger LLM. It first reviews a query and determines whether text or code is suitable for this problem, and which sort of code would be best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it generates a prompt for the larger LLM, telling it to use a coding method or textual reasoning to answer the query. The larger model follows this prompt to answer the query and sends the result back to CodeSteer, which reviews it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the answer is not correct, CodeSteer will continue prompting the LLM to try different things that might fix the problem, such as incorporating a search algorithm or constraint into its Python code, until the answer is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that oftentimes, the larger LLM will try to be lazy and use a shorter, less efficient code that will not carry the correct symbolic calculation. We’ve designed CodeSteer to avoid this phenomenon,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A symbolic checker evaluates the code’s complexity and sends a signal to CodeSteer if it is too simple or inefficient. The researchers also incorporate a self-answer checker into CodeSteer, which prompts the LLM to generate code that calculates the answer to verify it is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tackling complex tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers designed CodeSteer, they couldn’t find suitable symbolic datasets to fine-tune and test the model, since many existing benchmarks don’t point out whether a certain query could be best solved with text or code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, they gathered a corpus of 37 complex symbolic tasks, including spatial reasoning, mathematics, order reasoning, and optimization, and built their own dataset, called SymBench. They implemented a fine-tuning approach that leverages SymBench to maximize the performance of CodeSteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their experiments, CodeSteer outperformed all nine baseline methods they evaluated and boosted average accuracy from 53.3 percent to 86.4 percent. It maintains similar performance even on unseen tasks, and on a variety of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a general-purpose model augmented with CodeSteer can achieve higher accuracy than state-of-the-art models designed to focus on complex reasoning and planning, while requiring much less computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our method uses an LLM’s own capabilities. By augmenting an LLM with the ability to smartly use coding, we can take a model that is already very strong and improve its performance even more,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to streamline CodeSteer to speed up its iterative prompting process. In addition, they are studying how to effectively fine-tune a unified model with the ability to switch between textual reasoning and code generation, rather than relying on a separate assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The authors present an elegant solution to the critical challenge of tool utilization in LLMs. This simple yet impactful method enables state-of-the-art LLMs to achieve significant performance improvements without requiring direct fine-tuning,” says Jinsung Yoon, a staff research scientist at Google Cloud AI, who was not involved with this work. “This research represents a substantial contribution that promises to significantly enhance the application of LLMs to a diverse range of tasks with which they currently struggle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their success in training a smaller, specialized model to strategically guide larger, advanced models is particularly impactful,” adds Chi Wang, a senior staff scientist at Google DeepMind who was not involved with this work. “This intelligent collaboration among diverse AI ‘agents’ paves the way for more robust and versatile applications in complex real-world scenarios.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is supported, in part, by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve outlined in many stories and newsletters that AC is a significant contributor to global electricity demand, and it’s only going to suck up more power as temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I’ll also be the first to admit that it can be a life-saving technology, one that may become even more necessary as climate change intensifies. And in the wake of Europe’s recent deadly heat wave, it’s been oddly villainized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;We should all be aware of the growing electricity toll of air-conditioning, but the AC hate is misplaced. Yes, AC is energy intensive, but so is heating our homes, something that’s rarely decried in the same way that cooling is. Both are tools for comfort and, more important, for safety. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;So why is air-conditioning cast as &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a villain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the last days of June and the first few days of July, temperatures hit record highs across Europe. Over 2,300 deaths during that period were attributed to the heat wave, according to early research from World Weather Attribution, an academic collaboration that studies extreme weather. And human-caused climate change accounted for 1,500 of the deaths, the researchers found. (That is, the number of fatalities would have been under 800 if not for higher temperatures because of climate change.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;We won’t have the official death toll for months, but these early figures show just how deadly heat waves can be. &lt;strong&gt;Europe is especially vulnerable, because in many countries, particularly in the northern part of the continent, air-conditioning is not common.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Popping on a fan, drawing the shades, or opening the windows on the hottest days used to cut it in many European countries. Not anymore. The UK was 1.24 °C (2.23 °F) warmer over the past decade than it was between 1961 and 1990, according to the Met Office, the UK’s national climate and weather service. One recent study found that homes across the country are uncomfortably or dangerously warm much more frequently than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The reality is, some parts of the world are seeing an upward shift in temperatures that’s not just uncomfortable but dangerous. &lt;strong&gt;As a result, air-conditioning usage is going up all over the world, including in countries with historically low rates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reaction to this long-term trend, especially in the face of the recent heat wave, has been apoplectic. People are decrying AC across social media and opinion pages, arguing that we need to suck it up and deal with being a little bit uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, let me preface this by saying that I do live in the US, where roughly 90% of homes are cooled with air-conditioning today. So perhaps I am a little biased in favor of AC. But it baffles me when people talk about air-conditioning this way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I spent a good amount of my childhood in the southeastern US, where it’s very obvious that heat can be dangerous. I was used to many days where temperatures were well above 90 °F (32 °C), and the humidity was so high your clothes would stick to you as soon as you stepped outdoors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, being active or working in those conditions can lead to heatstroke. Prolonged exposure, even if it’s not immediately harmful, can lead to heart and kidney problems. Older people, children, and those with chronic conditions can be more vulnerable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, air-conditioning is more than a convenience; in certain conditions, it’s a safety measure. That should be an easy enough concept to grasp. After all, in many parts of the world we expect access to heating in the name of safety. Nobody wants to freeze to death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And it’s important to clarify here that while air-conditioning does use a lot of electricity in the US, heating actually has a higher energy footprint.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the US, about 19% of residential electricity use goes to air-conditioning.&lt;/strong&gt; That sounds like a lot, and it’s significantly more than the 12% of electricity that goes to space heating. However, we need to zoom out to get the full picture, because electricity makes up only part of a home’s total energy demand. A lot of homes in the US use natural gas for heating—that’s not counted in the electricity being used, but it’s certainly part of the home’s total energy use.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we look at the total, space heating accounts for a full 42% of residential energy consumption in the US, while air conditioning accounts for only 9%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m not letting AC off the hook entirely here. There’s obviously a difference between running air-conditioning (or other, less energy-intensive technologies) when needed to stay safe and blasting systems at max capacity because you prefer it chilly. And there’s a lot of grid planning we’ll need to do to make sure we can handle the expected influx of air-conditioning around the globe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the world is changing, and temperatures are rising. If you’re looking for a villain, look beyond the air conditioner and into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

However, we need to zoom out to get the full picture, because electricity makes up only part of a home’s total energy demand. A lot of homes in the US use natural gas for heating—that’s not counted in the electricity being used, but it’s certainly part of the home’s total energy use.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we look at the total, space heating accounts for a full 42% of residential energy consumption in the US, while air conditioning accounts for only 9%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m not letting AC off the hook entirely here. There’s obviously a difference between running air-conditioning (or other, less energy-intensive technologies) when needed to stay safe and blasting systems at max capacity because you prefer it chilly. And there’s a lot of grid planning we’ll need to do to make sure we can handle the expected influx of air-conditioning around the globe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the world is changing, and temperatures are rising. If you’re looking for a villain, look beyond the air conditioner and into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

The moves come as Salesforce simultaneously restricts external AI companies from accessing Slack data, creating a walled garden approach that mirrors broader industry trends toward platform consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unlike some AI tools that sit outside the flow of work, Slack’s AI shows up where work happens – across conversations, decisions, and documentation,” said Shalini Agarwal, Vice President of Slack Product at Salesforce, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “The key differentiator is context, which comes in the form of structured and unstructured data in Slack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing underscores intensifying competition in the $45 billion enterprise collaboration market, where Microsoft’s Teams platform and its Copilot AI assistant have gained significant traction against Slack since Salesforce’s $27.7 billion acquisition of the messaging service in 2021. Google is also pushing its Duet AI across Workspace applications, creating a three-way battle for corporate customers increasingly focused on AI-driven productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-slack-s-contextual-ai-works-inside-workplace-conversations"&gt;How Slack’s contextual AI works inside workplace conversations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slack’s new capabilities depart from traditional AI assistant models that require users to actively prompt for help. Instead, the platform will proactively surface relevant information and automate routine tasks within existing workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI writing assistance, launching soon within Slack’s canvas feature, will allow teams to automatically generate project briefs from conversation threads, extract action items from brainstorming sessions, and reformat meeting notes into structured updates. When combined with Slack’s existing AI-powered meeting transcription in huddles, the feature creates an end-to-end documentation workflow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI needs to feel easy and seamless, and you shouldn’t have to work hard to use it,” Agarwal told VentureBeat. “Since the release of AI in Slack, customers have summarized more than 600 million messages, saving a collective 1.1 million hours across users.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more intriguingly, Slack will introduce contextual message explanations that activate when users hover over unfamiliar terms, acronyms, or project references. The feature draws from the organization’s unique vocabulary and conversation history stored within Slack, potentially solving a persistent onboarding and cross-team collaboration challenge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ever hit an unfamiliar acronym or bit of jargon in a Slack message? That moment of confusion, of searching or asking, slows everything down,” the company noted in its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-search-becomes-the-new-battleground-for-workplace-data"&gt;Enterprise search becomes the new battleground for workplace data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of Slack’s AI strategy is enterprise search, now generally available, which allows users to query information across connected applications including Salesforce, Microsoft Teams, Google Drive, Confluence, and Box from a single interface within Slack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The capability addresses a persistent productivity drain in modern workplaces, where employees spend an estimated 41% of their time on repetitive tasks like searching for information across disconnected systems, according to Slack’s research. By positioning Slack as the unified search interface for enterprise data, Salesforce is making a bold play to become the primary workspace hub for knowledge workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than building point-to-point connections between applications, Slack is positioning itself as the universal translator for workplace information. The approach acknowledges a harsh reality: most organizations have accepted that their data will remain scattered across dozens of applications, but they desperately need a better way to find and use that information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For IT departments, Slack promises minimal deployment complexity. “Generally, it should be a light lift for IT teams,” Agarwal said. “Connectors will be out of the box as they become available. Once admins enable an app, and users authenticate to it, results will be available immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-salesforce-is-blocking-ai-competitors-from-accessing-slack-data"&gt;Why Salesforce is blocking AI competitors from accessing Slack data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even as Slack opens its search capabilities to customers’ connected applications, Salesforce has been aggressively restricting how external AI companies access Slack data. In May, the company amended its API terms of service to prohibit bulk data exports and explicitly ban using Slack data to train large language models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move affects third-party AI search companies like Glean, which had been indexing Slack conversations alongside other enterprise data sources to provide unified search experiences. Under the new restrictions, such companies can only access Slack data through real-time search APIs with significant limitations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce is making a calculated gamble. By restricting access to Slack data, the company is betting that its own AI capabilities will prove superior to external alternatives. But enterprise customers have consistently shown they prefer choice and flexibility over forced vendor lock-in. If competing AI platforms deliver significantly better results using data from other sources, Salesforce risks pushing customers toward alternative messaging platforms that offer more open integration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The restrictions underscore how valuable workplace conversation data has become. With over 5 billion messages exchanged weekly on Slack, the platform contains what Agarwal describes as “the history of your company, and all the information across teams and projects.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This conversational data offers something unique in the enterprise software landscape: unstructured, context-rich information about how work actually gets done, rather than formal documentation about how it should get done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-security-concerns-drive-ai-trust-and-compliance-features"&gt;Enterprise security concerns drive AI trust and compliance features&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce has built its AI capabilities around what it calls “the Einstein Trust Layer,” emphasizing that customer data never leaves the company’s infrastructure or trains external AI models. The approach addresses enterprise concerns about data sovereignty that have slowed AI adoption in regulated industries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Protecting our customers’ data is Slack’s top priority,” Agarwal said. “Customer data stays in-house, Slack does not share customer data with LLM providers, and Slack does not use customer data to train LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform’s AI features inherit Slack’s existing enterprise-grade security controls, including support for FedRAMP compliance, encryption key management, and international data residency requirements. Search results automatically respect existing user permissions across connected applications, preventing unauthorized data exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-customer-results-show-measurable-productivity-gains-from-ai-features"&gt;Early customer results show measurable productivity gains from AI features&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early customer results suggest meaningful productivity gains, though the sample size remains limited. Salesforce’s internal engineering team reports that its AI agent has handled over 18,000 conversations across 3,500 users in six months, potentially saving the equivalent of eight full-time employees worth of work annually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other customers report similar metrics. OpenTable handled 73% of restaurant web queries using Salesforce’s Agentforce AI in just three weeks, while payment processor Engine reduced average handle time by 15% and projects $2 million in annual cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These early results, while promising, should be viewed with appropriate skepticism. Productivity measurements in enterprise software often suffer from selection bias, where only the most successful implementations generate public case studies. The true test of Slack’s AI capabilities will come as adoption scales beyond early adopters to mainstream enterprise customers with more complex, less standardized workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-slack-s-ai-strategy-compares-to-microsoft-copilot-and-google-workspace"&gt;How Slack’s AI strategy compares to Microsoft Copilot and Google Workspace&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The announcements position Slack more directly against Microsoft’s comprehensive AI strategy, which includes Copilot integration across the Office 365 suite and Teams platform. Microsoft’s approach has gained significant enterprise traction, with the company reporting that Copilot adoption is driving workplace productivity gains across its customer base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Slack’s conversational-first approach may offer advantages for organizations where informal communication drives decision-making. “Slack’s conversational interface and rich context make it a very natural home for AI agents,” Agarwal noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company is also extending its reach through new pricing strategies, including significant government discounts that mirror Google’s competitive tactics. In May, Salesforce announced up to 90% discounts for federal agencies through November, replacing fragmented agency-by-agency negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-autonomous-ai-agents-in-workplace-collaboration"&gt;The future of autonomous AI agents in workplace collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agarwal’s vision extends beyond current capabilities toward autonomous AI agents that can execute complex workflows across multiple systems. “Our vision for an agentic work operating system is that everyone can bring AI, agents, customer data, team collaboration, and connected systems into a single place so they can work faster and smarter,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company recently launched Agentforce in Slack, bringing task-specific digital teammates that can update CRM records, post in channels, and assist with employee onboarding. Early results show Salesforce’s sales team saving 66,000 hours annually through AI assistance with deal insights and executive briefings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI capabilities become table stakes for enterprise software, Slack’s success may depend on execution rather than innovation. The platform’s strength lies in its position as the de facto standard for workplace messaging, providing the conversational context that makes AI responses more relevant and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether this contextual advantage proves sustainable against Microsoft’s integrated ecosystem and Google’s search expertise remains an open question. But for now, Salesforce is betting that the future of work happens in conversations — and that whoever controls those conversations controls the workplace AI market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new AI features will be included in all paid Slack plans, with advanced capabilities reserved for higher-tier subscriptions. Enterprise+ customers will receive the full AI experience, including enterprise search and governance controls designed for large-scale deployment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprise decision-makers evaluating AI collaboration tools, Slack’s approach offers a compelling alternative to Microsoft’s suite-wide integration strategy. The question is whether contextual AI within conversations can compete with the broader productivity gains promised by AI assistants embedded across entire software ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

Only eight months since its launch, the startup has raised a $200 million Series A round led by Accel at a $1.8 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like Cursor and other platforms that help developers write code and build apps by harnessing the coding and reasoning abilities of large language models, Stockholm-based Lovable helps people use natural language to create websites and apps. The startup’s trajectory so far has charted straight towards the sky, with the company claiming it now has more than 2.3 million active users.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those users are using Lovable for free, to be clear, but in a recent talk, the startup’s CEO Anton Osika said it now has more than 180,000 paying subscribers, and the company had reached annual recurring revenues of $75 million in seven months. That traction likely contributed to this oversized Series A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Series A saw participation from existing investors, which include 20VC, byFounders, Creandum, Hummingbird, and Visionaries Club. In February, Creandum led a $15 million pre-series A round in the company, which at the time said it had reached annual recurring revenue of $17 million and had 30,000 paying customers, with “just $2 million spent.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has managed this hockey-stick growth with a pretty sparse team of only 45 full-time employees. That’s almost as many as the high-profile angel investors who it said participated in this round, including Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski; Remote CEO Job van der Voort; Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield; and Hubspot co-founder Dharmesh Shah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lovable has gained traction with non-technical users, whom it helps create prototypes that teams can collaborate on. This, and tests, are likely the bulk of the 10 million projects that have been created on Lovable to date, according to a press release. But Osika’s startup also envisions itself as a tool to create production-grade applications that could become full-on startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Every day, brilliant founders and operators with game-changing ideas hit the same wall: they don’t have a developer to realize their vision quickly and easily,” Osika said in a statement. In a recent post on X, he wrote that he is now “an angel investor in a software startup built with Lovable,” which may be ad-testing platform Stardust (we reached out to the founder for confirmation, but haven’t heard back.)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Swedish entrepreneur also celebrated that an app made with Lovable had made $3 million in 48 hours hours; but rather than a startup, it was made by a large Brazilian edtech company. This could be another growth avenue for Lovable, which has already managed to acquire enterprise customers — including, not so coincidentally, Klarna and Hubspot.&lt;/p&gt;
