&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I recently had a patient come in, and when I recommended a medication, they had a dialogue printed out from ChatGPT that said this medication has a 45% chance of pulmonary embolism,” Dr. Bari told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When Dr. Bari investigated further, he found that the statistic was from a paper about the impact of that medication in a niche subgroup of people with tuberculosis, which didn’t apply to his patient.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And yet, when OpenAI announced its dedicated ChatGPT Health chatbot last week, Dr. Bari felt more excitement than concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT Health, which will roll out in the coming weeks, allows users to talk to the chatbot about their health in a more private setting, where their messages won’t be used as training data for the underlying AI model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think it’s great,” Dr. Bari said. “It is something that’s already happening, so formalizing it so as to protect patient information and put some safeguards around it […] is going to make it all the more powerful for patients to use.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can get more personalized guidance from ChatGPT Health by uploading their medical records and syncing with apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal. For the security-minded, this raises immediate red flags.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“All of a sudden there’s medical data transferring from HIPAA-compliant organizations to non-HIPAA-compliant vendors,” Itai Schwartz, co-founder of data loss prevention firm MIND, told TechCrunch. “So I’m curious to see how the regulators would approach this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the way some industry professionals see it, the cat is already out of the bag. Now, instead of Googling cold symptoms, people are talking to AI chatbots — over 230 million people already talk to ChatGPT about their health each week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This was one of the biggest use cases of ChatGPT,” Andrew Brackin, a partner at Gradient who invests in health tech, told TechCrunch. “So it makes a lot of sense that they would want to build a more kind of private, secure, optimized version of ChatGPT for these healthcare questions.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI chatbots have a persistent problem with hallucinations, a particularly sensitive issue in healthcare. According to Vectara’s Factual Consistency Evaluation Model, OpenAI’s GPT-5 is more prone to hallucinations than many Google and Anthropic models. But AI companies see the potential to rectify inefficiencies in the healthcare space (Anthropic also announced a health product this week).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Dr. Nigam Shah, a professor of medicine at Stanford and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, the inability of American patients to access care is more urgent than the threat of ChatGPT dispensing poor advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Right now, you go to any health system and you want to meet the primary care doctor — the wait time will be three to six months,” Dr. Shah said. “If your choice is to wait six months for a real doctor, or talk to something that is not a doctor but can do some things for you, which would you pick?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Shah thinks a clearer route to introduce AI into healthcare systems comes on the provider side, rather than the patient side.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Medical journals have often reported that administrative tasks can consume about half of a primary care physician’s time, which slashes the number of patients they can see in a given day. If that kind of work could be automated, doctors would be able to see more patients, perhaps reducing the need for people to use tools like ChatGPT Health without additional input from a real doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Shah leads a team at Stanford that is developing ChatEHR, a software that is built into the electronic health record (EHR) system, allowing clinicians to interact with a patient’s medical records in a more streamlined, efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Making the electronic medical record more user friendly means physicians can spend less time scouring every nook and cranny of it for the information they need,” Dr. Sneha Jain, an early tester of ChatEHR, said in a Stanford Medicine article. “ChatEHR can help them get that information up front so they can spend time on what matters — talking to patients and figuring out what’s going on.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic is also working on AI products that can be used on the clinician and insurer sides, rather than just its public-facing Claude chatbot. This week, Anthropic announced Claude for Healthcare by explaining how it could be used to reduce the time spent on tedious administrative tasks, like submitting prior authorization requests to insurance providers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Some of you see hundreds, thousands of these prior authorization cases a week,” said Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger in a recent presentation at J.P. Morgan’s Healthcare Conference. “So imagine cutting 20, 30 minutes out of each of them — it’s a dramatic time savings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As AI and medicine become more intertwined, there’s an inescapable tension between the two worlds — a doctor’s primary incentive is to help their patients, while tech companies are ultimately accountable to their shareholders, even if their intentions are noble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think that tension is an important one,” Dr. Bari said. “Patients rely on us to be cynical and conservative in order to protect them.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1369564450.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Dr. Sina Bari, a practicing surgeon and AI healthcare leader at data company iMerit, has seen firsthand how ChatGPT can lead patients astray with faulty medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;

For Jamie Siminoff of the video doorbell maker Ring, it was the potential of AI — and the Palisades fires that destroyed his garage, the birthplace of Ring itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Siminoff’s vision: turn Ring from a video doorbell company into an AI-powered “intelligent assistant” for the entire home and beyond. A handful of new features that advance that goal shipped just ahead of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, including fire alerts, alerts about “unusual events,” conversational AI, facial recognition features, and more. Some of these additions have not been without controversy, as consumers have to grapple with how much privacy they’re giving up in favor of convenience and security. But together, they point to Ring’s latest phase of its business.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Turn AI backwards — it’s IA, it’s an intelligent assistant,” Siminoff explained in a conversation at CES last week. “We keep doing these things together that are making us smarter, and making it so that, for you, there’s less cognitive load.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By 2023, five years after selling Ring to Amazon, Siminoff had been running at full throttle for so long that he needed out. “I built the company in my garage…I was there for all of it. We then get to Amazon, and I go even faster — like, more throttle,” Siminoff told TechCrunch. “I didn’t get to Amazon and say, ‘I’m an exited entrepreneur, I’ll just chill out,’” he adds. “I blasted the f**king gas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When he later decided to depart the retail giant, he said it was because it felt like the time was right — Ring had delivered its products and was profitable. AI’s advances soon had him rethinking his plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3082346" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though Siminoff could have done anything, he wasn’t motivated to start something new because the things he was most excited about were those he wanted to build on Ring’s platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI comes out, and you realize, ‘Oh my God, there’s so much we could do,’” Siminoff said. “And then the fires happened,” he adds, referring to the devastating Palisades Fires that impacted Siminoff’s neighbors and burned the back of his house, destroying the garage where Ring was built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of Ring’s new additions, Fire Watch, was inspired by this tragedy. In partnership with&amp;nbsp;the nonprofit fire monitoring organization Watch Duty, Ring customers will be able to opt in to share footage when a massive fire event happens, allowing the organization to build a better map that can be used to help deploy firefighting resources more efficiently. The AI will be used in that case to look for smoke, fire, embers, and more in the shared footage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3082344" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Fire-Watch-Slide1-Desktop.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another recently launched AI feature, Search Party, also aims to solve real-world problems as it helps people find their lost pets. That feature is now reuniting one family per day with their dogs — a rate higher than Siminoff expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I had hoped to find one dog by the end of Q1…that was my goal. No one’s ever done anything remotely like this, and I just didn’t know how the AI would work,” he admits. The AI, a sort of “facial recognition for dogs,” tries matching a posted image of a lost pet with Ring footage, which users opt into sharing if they get an alert about a possible match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3082340" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SPDSlide3-Desktop.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other moves, however, have raised concerns, particularly those that saw the company forging deals with law enforcement. In 2024, Ring ended an earlier set of police partnerships that allowed police to request footage from Ring owners after some customer backlash. But this year, the company moved forward with new deals with companies like Flock Safety and Axon, which reintroduced tools that again allow law enforcement to request images and videos from Ring’s customers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Siminoff defends the company’s decisions in this space, saying that customers can choose whether or not they want to share their Ring footage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The requesting agency doesn’t even know that they asked you,” he says. That is, if police are looking for someone who’s been breaking into cars in a certain geographic area, the alert will go out, and customers can respond if they choose. If customers decline, it’s anonymous.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He also points to the Brown University shooting in December. A combination of surveillance cameras — including Ring’s, Siminoff claims, helped to find the mass shooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Scrutiny is fine…I welcome it, but I’m glad that we stood up to it, because in the Brown shooting, the police needed this,” the founder says. “If we had caved to people’s ‘maybe’s,’ and the scrutiny that they were giving us — [that] I don’t think is correct — the police wouldn’t have had a tool to try to help find this [shooter], and the community would not have had the ability to as easily share in what was happening and as fast.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the successful capture of the shooting suspect, there are still worries about what the mounting collection of data from private customers means for the landscape of the country. Plus, some are concerned that the data could be misused to go after anyone the government decides to target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another AI feature, “Familiar Faces,” has also received pushback from the consumer protection organization EFF, along with a U.S. senator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3074302" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The facial recognition feature uses AI to allow Ring to identify and store the faces of people who come in and out of the home on a regular basis, including their names, if provided. This way, you could get an alert that “mom” is at the front door, or that the babysitter arrived, or the kids are home from school, for instance. The feature could also be used to help disable alerts about people whose comings and goings don’t need to be watched closely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Siminoff defends this, too, as a way for Ring to become more personalized to its users and customize the software to adapt to the unique “fingerprint” of their house. That way, the customer has to interact less with Ring’s products, unless it’s something that requires attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3082347" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?w=510" width="510" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He argues that this addition builds on trust with Ring’s customers, rather than undermining it. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our products will not be on neighbors’ houses if they don’t trust us….There’s no incentive for us to do something that would lose trust with our neighbors in maintaining their privacy,” Siminoff says. “Anyone — and I would respect it — would take their camera off of their home if they felt like we were violating their privacy.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But with Ring’s expansion into commercial camera systems, including mounted cameras, a line of sensors, and a solar-powered trailer, also introduced just ahead of CES, the company’s customer base won’t just be neighbors protecting their homes but also businesses, job sites, campuses, festivals, parking lots, and everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;What does it take to bring a burned-out founder back to the company he sold to Amazon?

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another recently launched AI feature, Search Party, also aims to solve real-world problems as it helps people find their lost pets. That feature is now reuniting one family per day with their dogs — a rate higher than Siminoff expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I had hoped to find one dog by the end of Q1…that was my goal. No one’s ever done anything remotely like this, and I just didn’t know how the AI would work,” he admits. The AI, a sort of “facial recognition for dogs,” tries matching a posted image of a lost pet with Ring footage, which users opt into sharing if they get an alert about a possible match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3082340" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SPDSlide3-Desktop.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other moves, however, have raised concerns, particularly those that saw the company forging deals with law enforcement. In 2024, Ring ended an earlier set of police partnerships that allowed police to request footage from Ring owners after some customer backlash. But this year, the company moved forward with new deals with companies like Flock Safety and Axon, which reintroduced tools that again allow law enforcement to request images and videos from Ring’s customers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Siminoff defends the company’s decisions in this space, saying that customers can choose whether or not they want to share their Ring footage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The requesting agency doesn’t even know that they asked you,” he says. That is, if police are looking for someone who’s been breaking into cars in a certain geographic area, the alert will go out, and customers can respond if they choose. If customers decline, it’s anonymous.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He also points to the Brown University shooting in December. A combination of surveillance cameras — including Ring’s, Siminoff claims, helped to find the mass shooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Scrutiny is fine…I welcome it, but I’m glad that we stood up to it, because in the Brown shooting, the police needed this,” the founder says. “If we had caved to people’s ‘maybe’s,’ and the scrutiny that they were giving us — [that] I don’t think is correct — the police wouldn’t have had a tool to try to help find this [shooter], and the community would not have had the ability to as easily share in what was happening and as fast.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the successful capture of the shooting suspect, there are still worries about what the mounting collection of data from private customers means for the landscape of the country. Plus, some are concerned that the data could be misused to go after anyone the government decides to target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another AI feature, “Familiar Faces,” has also received pushback from the consumer protection organization EFF, along with a U.S. senator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3074302" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The facial recognition feature uses AI to allow Ring to identify and store the faces of people who come in and out of the home on a regular basis, including their names, if provided. This way, you could get an alert that “mom” is at the front door, or that the babysitter arrived, or the kids are home from school, for instance. The feature could also be used to help disable alerts about people whose comings and goings don’t need to be watched closely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Siminoff defends this, too, as a way for Ring to become more personalized to its users and customize the software to adapt to the unique “fingerprint” of their house. That way, the customer has to interact less with Ring’s products, unless it’s something that requires attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3082347" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?w=510" width="510" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He argues that this addition builds on trust with Ring’s customers, rather than undermining it. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our products will not be on neighbors’ houses if they don’t trust us….There’s no incentive for us to do something that would lose trust with our neighbors in maintaining their privacy,” Siminoff says. “Anyone — and I would respect it — would take their camera off of their home if they felt like we were violating their privacy.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But with Ring’s expansion into commercial camera systems, including mounted cameras, a line of sensors, and a solar-powered trailer, also introduced just ahead of CES, the company’s customer base won’t just be neighbors protecting their homes but also businesses, job sites, campuses, festivals, parking lots, and everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/ring-founder-details-the-camera-companys-intelligent-assistant-era/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:05:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Google’s updated Veo model can make vertical videos from reference images with 4K upscaling (AI - Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/googles-updated-veo-model-can-make-vertical-videos-from-reference-images-with-4k-upscaling/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Google’s Veo video AI made stunning leaps in fidelity in 2025, and Google isn’t stopping in 2026. The company has announced an update for Veo 3.1 that adds new capabilities when you provide the model with reference material, known as Ingredients to Video. The results should be more consistent, and output supports vertical video and higher-resolution upscaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Ingredients to Video, you can provide the AI with up to three images to incorporate into the generated video. You can use that to provide the robot with characters to animate, backgrounds, and material textures. When you do that, the newly upgraded model will allegedly make fewer random alterations, hemming closer to the reference images. You can also generate multiple clips and even prompt for changes to the setting or style while keeping other elements consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

Veo 3.1 Updates – Bring more creativity and expressiveness into your videos.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is also expanding its support for mobile-first video in Veo. When using Ingredients to Video, you can now specify outputs in a 9:16 (vertical) ratio. That makes it ideal for posting on social apps like Instagram or TikTok, as well as uploading as a YouTube Short. So get ready for even more phone-centric slop. Google added support for vertical videos via a text prompt last year.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhanced support for Ingredients to Video and the associated vertical outputs are live in the Gemini app today, as well as in YouTube Shorts and the YouTube Create app, fulfilling a promise initially made last summer. Veo videos are short—just eight seconds long for each prompt. It would be tedious to assemble those into a longer video, but Veo is perfect for the Shorts format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Veo 3.1 Updates – Seamlessly blend textures, characters, and objects.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Veo 3.1 update also adds an option for higher-resolution video. The model now supports 1080p and 4K outputs. Google debuted 1080p support last year, but it’s mentioning that option again today, suggesting there may be some quality difference. 4K support is new, but neither 1080p nor 4K outputs are native. Veo creates everything in 720p resolution, but it can be upscaled “for high-fidelity production workflows,” according to Google. However, a Google rep tells Ars that upscaling is only available in Flow, the Gemini API, and Vertex AI. Video in the Gemini app is always 720p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are rushing into a world where AI video is essentially indistinguishable from real life. Google, which more or less controls online video via YouTube’s dominance, is at the forefront of that change. Today’s update is reasonably significant, and it didn’t even warrant a version number change. Perhaps we can expect more 2025-style leaps in video quality this year, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;

      Veo 3.1 Updates – Seamlessly blend textures, characters, and objects.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Veo 3.1 update also adds an option for higher-resolution video. The model now supports 1080p and 4K outputs. Google debuted 1080p support last year, but it’s mentioning that option again today, suggesting there may be some quality difference. 4K support is new, but neither 1080p nor 4K outputs are native. Veo creates everything in 720p resolution, but it can be upscaled “for high-fidelity production workflows,” according to Google. However, a Google rep tells Ars that upscaling is only available in Flow, the Gemini API, and Vertex AI. Video in the Gemini app is always 720p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are rushing into a world where AI video is essentially indistinguishable from real life. Google, which more or less controls online video via YouTube’s dominance, is at the forefront of that change. Today’s update is reasonably significant, and it didn’t even warrant a version number change. Perhaps we can expect more 2025-style leaps in video quality this year, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a now viral post on X viewed nearly 400,000 times, Lindsay Owens on Sunday wrote, “Big/bad news for consumers. Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Owens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank Groundwork Collaborative. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as well as delving into some of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai described when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a post on X, Google responded that, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Owens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents on handling a shopper’s identity say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered Google to change a number of search business practices after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like Dupe, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and Beni, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Until then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1354022389.jpg?resize=1200,789" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Shortly after Google announced its new Universal Commerce Protocol for AI-powered shopping agents, a consumer economics watchdog sounded the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Microsoft announced a new initiative called “Community-First AI Infrastructure” that commits the company to paying full electricity costs for its data centers and refusing to seek local property tax reductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As demand for generative AI services has increased over the past year, Big Tech companies have been racing to spin up massive new data centers for serving chatbots and image generators that can have profound economic effects on the surrounding areas where they are located. Among other concerns, communities across the country have grown concerned that data centers are driving up residential electricity rates through heavy power consumption and by straining water supplies due to server cooling needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global data center electricity demand will more than double by 2030, reaching around 945 TWh, with the United States responsible for nearly half of total electricity demand growth over that period. This growth is happening while much of the country’s electricity transmission infrastructure is more than 40 years old and under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a big enough issue that in December, US senators launched a probe demanding tech companies explain how they plan to prevent data center projects from increasing electricity bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote in the company’s blog post about the announcement that the company will “set a high bar” for responsible data center development, making promises that seem targeted to quell the growing criticism surrounding AI data center construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s plan to address the issues includes five commitments: covering full electricity costs to prevent rate increases for residents, minimizing water use while replenishing more than the company withdraws, creating local jobs, paying full property taxes, and investing in AI training programs for data center communities.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;Taking responsibility for power usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Microsoft blog post, Smith acknowledged that residential electricity rates have recently risen in dozens of states, driven partly by inflation, supply chain constraints, and grid upgrades. He wrote that communities “value new jobs and property tax revenue, but not if they come with higher power bills or tighter water supplies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says it will ask utilities and public commissions to set rates high enough to cover the full electricity costs for its data centers, including infrastructure additions. In Wisconsin, the company is supporting a new rate structure that would charge “Very Large Customers,” including data centers, the cost of the electricity required to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith wrote that while some have suggested the public should help pay for the added electricity needed for AI, Microsoft disagrees. He stated, “Especially when tech companies are so profitable, we believe that it’s both unfair and politically unrealistic for our industry to ask the public to shoulder added electricity costs for AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On water usage for cooling, Microsoft plans a 40 percent improvement in data center water-use intensity by 2030. A recent environmental audit from AI model-maker Mistral found that training and running its Large 2 model over 18 months produced 20.4 kilotons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and evaporated enough water to fill 112 Olympic-size swimming pools, illustrating the aggregate environmental impact of AI operations at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve some of these issues, Microsoft says it has launched a new AI data center design using a closed-loop system that constantly recirculates cooling liquid, dramatically cutting water usage. In this design, already deployed in Wisconsin and Georgia, potable water is no longer needed for cooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On property taxes, Smith stated in the blog post that the company will not ask local municipalities to reduce their rates. The company says it will pay its full share of local property taxes. Smith wrote that Microsoft’s goal is to bring these commitments to life in the first half of 2026. Of course, these are PR-aligned company goals and not realities yet, so we’ll have to check back in later to see whether Microsoft has been following through on its promises.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Microsoft announced a new initiative called “Community-First AI Infrastructure” that commits the company to paying full electricity costs for its data centers and refusing to seek local property tax reductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As demand for generative AI services has increased over the past year, Big Tech companies have been racing to spin up massive new data centers for serving chatbots and image generators that can have profound economic effects on the surrounding areas where they are located. Among other concerns, communities across the country have grown concerned that data centers are driving up residential electricity rates through heavy power consumption and by straining water supplies due to server cooling needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global data center electricity demand will more than double by 2030, reaching around 945 TWh, with the United States responsible for nearly half of total electricity demand growth over that period. This growth is happening while much of the country’s electricity transmission infrastructure is more than 40 years old and under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a big enough issue that in December, US senators launched a probe demanding tech companies explain how they plan to prevent data center projects from increasing electricity bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote in the company’s blog post about the announcement that the company will “set a high bar” for responsible data center development, making promises that seem targeted to quell the growing criticism surrounding AI data center construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s plan to address the issues includes five commitments: covering full electricity costs to prevent rate increases for residents, minimizing water use while replenishing more than the company withdraws, creating local jobs, paying full property taxes, and investing in AI training programs for data center communities.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;Taking responsibility for power usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Microsoft blog post, Smith acknowledged that residential electricity rates have recently risen in dozens of states, driven partly by inflation, supply chain constraints, and grid upgrades. He wrote that communities “value new jobs and property tax revenue, but not if they come with higher power bills or tighter water supplies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says it will ask utilities and public commissions to set rates high enough to cover the full electricity costs for its data centers, including infrastructure additions. In Wisconsin, the company is supporting a new rate structure that would charge “Very Large Customers,” including data centers, the cost of the electricity required to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith wrote that while some have suggested the public should help pay for the added electricity needed for AI, Microsoft disagrees. He stated, “Especially when tech companies are so profitable, we believe that it’s both unfair and politically unrealistic for our industry to ask the public to shoulder added electricity costs for AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On water usage for cooling, Microsoft plans a 40 percent improvement in data center water-use intensity by 2030. A recent environmental audit from AI model-maker Mistral found that training and running its Large 2 model over 18 months produced 20.4 kilotons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and evaporated enough water to fill 112 Olympic-size swimming pools, illustrating the aggregate environmental impact of AI operations at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve some of these issues, Microsoft says it has launched a new AI data center design using a closed-loop system that constantly recirculates cooling liquid, dramatically cutting water usage. In this design, already deployed in Wisconsin and Georgia, potable water is no longer needed for cooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On property taxes, Smith stated in the blog post that the company will not ask local municipalities to reduce their rates. The company says it will pay its full share of local property taxes. Smith wrote that Microsoft’s goal is to bring these commitments to life in the first half of 2026. Of course, these are PR-aligned company goals and not realities yet, so we’ll have to check back in later to see whether Microsoft has been following through on its promises.&lt;/p&gt;

That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, announced what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to spend billions to expand its AI capacity. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.”&amp;nbsp;That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers accused of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other environmental concerns. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering questions around the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism,&amp;nbsp;has observed that&amp;nbsp;there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company abandoned plans for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township have recently inspired locals to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, an op-ed in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently developing several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Concerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “major changes” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. Trump said the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/microsoft-store-1185699758.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Although public backlash against data centers has been intense over the past 12 months, all of the tech industry’s biggest companies have promised additional buildouts of AI infrastructure in the coming year.

    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p&gt;MedGemma was designed from the ground up as a multimodal model, reflecting the multimodal nature of medicine. MedGemma 1 included support for interpreting two-dimensional medical images, including chest X-rays, dermatology images, fundus images and histopathology patches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With MedGemma 1.5, we are expanding support for high-dimensional medical imaging, starting with three-dimensional volume representations of CT imaging and MRI, as well as whole-slide histopathology imaging. Developers can create applications in which multiple slices (for CT or MRI) or multiple patches (for histopathology) are provided as input along with a prompt that describes the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On internal benchmarks, the baseline absolute accuracy of MedGemma 1.5 improved by 3% over MedGemma 1 (61% vs. 58%) on classification of disease-related CT findings and by 14% (65% vs. 51%) on classification of disease-related MRI findings, averaged over findings. Additionally, on an internal diverse benchmark of histopathology slides and associated findings, the fidelity of MedGemma 1.5’s predictions, based on ROUGE-L score on cases with exactly one histopathology slide, improved by 0.47 over MedGemma 1 (0.49 vs. 0.02), matching the 0.498 score achieved by the task-specific PolyPath model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new high-dimensional support is the natural evolution of CT foundation, our previous API-based tool for generation of CT embeddings. To our knowledge, MedGemma 1.5 is the first public release of an open multimodal large language model that can interpret high-dimensional medical data while also retaining the ability to interpret general 2D data and text. Although these capabilities are in their early stages and remain imperfect, developers will achieve improved results by fine-tuning MedGemma models on their own data, and we hope to continually improve MedGemma models over time. We’ve released tutorial notebooks that illustrate how to use this high dimensional image capability for CT (Hugging Face, Model Garden) and histopathology (Hugging Face, Model Garden).&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Monday, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he plans to integrate Elon Musk’s AI tool, Grok, into Pentagon networks later this month. During remarks at the SpaceX headquarters in Texas reported by The Guardian, Hegseth said the integration would place “the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes weeks after Grok drew international backlash for generating sexualized images of women and children, although the Department of Defense has not released official documentation confirming Hegseth’s announced timeline or implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the same appearance, Hegseth rolled out what he called an “AI acceleration strategy” for the Department of Defense. The strategy, he said, will “unleash experimentation, eliminate bureaucratic barriers, focus on investments, and demonstrate the execution approach needed to ensure we lead in military AI and that it grows more dominant into the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the plan, Hegseth directed the DOD’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office to use its full authority to enforce department data policies, making information available across all IT systems for AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If implemented, Grok would join other AI models the Pentagon has adopted in recent months. In July 2025, the defense department issued contracts worth up to $200 million for each of four companies, including Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI, for developing AI agent systems across different military operations. In December 2025, the Department of Defense selected Google’s Gemini as the foundation for GenAI.mil, an internal AI platform for military use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A pattern of controversies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grok has faced multiple scandals since xAI received the July defense contract. Just days before the contract announcement, the chatbot began generating antisemitic content, declaring itself a “super-Nazi,” adopting the name “MechaHitler,” and posting racist material. The incident prompted one US government agency to drop Grok from a General Services Administration contract offering in August, according to emails reviewed by Wired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, as we mentioned above, users discovered they could create non-consensual intimate images of real people through Grok within the social media platform X. One researcher who conducted a 24-hour analysis estimated that Grok generated over 6,000 sexually suggestive images per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI has not publicly addressed the image-generation concerns, though the company attempted to restrict some image-editing features to paid subscribers. The restrictions proved incomplete, as users could still access editing functions through different parts of the X platform and the standalone Grok app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia blocked access to Grok on Saturday due to imagery issues, with Malaysia implementing a similar block shortly after. British regulator Ofcom opened a formal investigation into X because Grok is being used to create manipulated images of women and children. Democratic senators have called for Apple and Google to remove X and Grok from their app stores until the company improves safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon has not publicly explained its evaluation process for Grok given these incidents. Significant questions remain about which security measures will protect classified military networks from similar behavioral problems and which technical measures will attempt to keep Grok from confabulating inaccurate analysis of important military data.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;RAM prices have soared, which is bad news for people interested in buying, building, or upgrading a computer this year, but it’s likely good news for people exasperated by talk of so-called AI PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ars Technica has reported, the growing demands of data centers, fueled by the AI boom, have led to a shortage of RAM and flash memory chips, driving prices to skyrocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an announcement today, Ben Yeh, principal analyst at technology research firm Omdia, said that in 2025, “mainstream PC memory and storage costs rose by 40 percent to 70 percent, resulting in cost increases being passed through to customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, global PC shipments increased in 2025, according to Omdia, (which pegged growth at 9.2 percent compared to 2024), and IDC, (which today reported 9.6 percent growth), but analysts expect PC sales to be more tumultuous in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The year ahead is shaping up to be extremely volatile,” Jean Philippe Bouchard, research VP with IDC’s worldwide mobile device trackers, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both analyst firms expect PC makers to manage the RAM shortage by raising prices and by releasing computers with lower memory specs. IDC expects price hikes of 15 to 20 percent and for PC RAM specs to “be lowered on average to preserve memory inventory on hand,” Bouchard said. Omdia’s Yeh expects “leaner mid to low-tier configurations to protect margins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These RAM shortages will last beyond just 2026, and the cost-conscious part of the market is the one that will be most impacted,” Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for worldwide mobile device trackers at IDC, told Ars via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDC expects vendors to “prioritize midrange and premium systems to offset higher component costs, especially memory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RAM shortage hits AI PCs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased costs have implications for the concept of “AI PCs,” a term OEMs have used consistently over the last two years as they sought to leverage the growth of generative AI chatbots to drive computer sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoppers, however, have been either too reluctant or too savvy to buy into manufacturer-made AI PC hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PC OEMs had trouble selling the on-device AI message even before the memory shortages,” Ubrani said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT buyers will likely also consider local AI capabilities a lower priority if OEMs lower RAM specs to address the component shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“General interest in AI PCs has been wavering for a while, since cloud-based options are widely available and the use cases for on-device AI have been limited. This indifference (between on-device and cloud-based) from a demand perspective might work in favor of PC OEMs, as they don’t need to provide large amounts of RAM,” Ubrani said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With RAM pricing stability possibly not arriving until 2027, per Ubrani, it may be a while until RAM is readily available enough for it to make sense for PC companies to put as much emphasis on AI PCs, which generally require at least 16GB of memory, as they have in the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen a shift from AI PCs from Dell. In 2025, it discontinued its XPS brand of consumer laptops and desktops, partially due to the belief that “the AI PC market is quickly evolving,” Kevin Terwilliger, VP and GM of commercial, consumer, and gaming PCs at Dell, told media outlets at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone from IT decision makers to professionals and everyday users are looking at on-device AI to help drive productivity and creativity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;At CES 2026, however, Dell resurrected the XPS brand and reframed its laptop marketing around build, battery life, and display quality. Terwilliger also sang a different tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“… what we’ve learned over the course of this year, especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI,” Terwilliger said at a press briefing ahead of the show. “In fact, I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving from the hype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also seems aware of the shortcomings of AI PCs. In December, The Information reported that CEO Satya Nadella had sent an email to engineering heads expressing disappointment with the consumer version of Copilot. He reportedly wrote that tools for connecting Copilot with Outlook and Gmail “for [the] most part don’t really work” and are “not smart.” The publication also reported that Nadella delegated some of his responsibilities to spend more time on Copilot. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, it stands to reason that we’re far from hearing the last about AI PCs. Currently, there are still plenty of stakeholders pushing AI PCs in 2026. But as we all await the end of the RAM shortage, it seems that at least some brands will attempt to build AI PCs with a significant and relevant purpose and scale back on trying to get people to buy a computer that can handle AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of AI PCs isn’t inherently a bad thing. But in recent years, it felt like technology companies were exploiting generative AI to convince people and companies to buy more or more powerful devices, even if they didn’t need them or local AI processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with a RAM crunch and lack of customer demand, there’s hope for AI PC marketing spiel to relent somewhat and for PC companies to try harder to prove that AI PCs are a solution to a problem, not a solution searching for a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;RAM prices have soared, which is bad news for people interested in buying, building, or upgrading a computer this year, but it’s likely good news for people exasperated by talk of so-called AI PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ars Technica has reported, the growing demands of data centers, fueled by the AI boom, have led to a shortage of RAM and flash memory chips, driving prices to skyrocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an announcement today, Ben Yeh, principal analyst at technology research firm Omdia, said that in 2025, “mainstream PC memory and storage costs rose by 40 percent to 70 percent, resulting in cost increases being passed through to customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, global PC shipments increased in 2025, according to Omdia, (which pegged growth at 9.2 percent compared to 2024), and IDC, (which today reported 9.6 percent growth), but analysts expect PC sales to be more tumultuous in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The year ahead is shaping up to be extremely volatile,” Jean Philippe Bouchard, research VP with IDC’s worldwide mobile device trackers, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both analyst firms expect PC makers to manage the RAM shortage by raising prices and by releasing computers with lower memory specs. IDC expects price hikes of 15 to 20 percent and for PC RAM specs to “be lowered on average to preserve memory inventory on hand,” Bouchard said. Omdia’s Yeh expects “leaner mid to low-tier configurations to protect margins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These RAM shortages will last beyond just 2026, and the cost-conscious part of the market is the one that will be most impacted,” Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for worldwide mobile device trackers at IDC, told Ars via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDC expects vendors to “prioritize midrange and premium systems to offset higher component costs, especially memory.”&lt;/p&gt;
