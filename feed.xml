Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.5 trillion market cap company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups,&amp;nbsp;particularly in AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia has participated in 50 venture capital deals&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;so far in 2025, already surpassing the 48 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 21 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia&amp;nbsp;has stated&amp;nbsp;that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-billion-dollar-round-club"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The billion-dollar-round club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a&amp;nbsp;$100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the chipmaker announced in September that it would invest up to&amp;nbsp;$100 billion&amp;nbsp;in the company over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xAI:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to&amp;nbsp;$2 billion&amp;nbsp;in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistral AI:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model developer raised €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in&amp;nbsp;September.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflection AI&lt;/strong&gt;: In October, Nvidia led a&amp;nbsp;$2 billion funding round&amp;nbsp;for Reflection AI, a one-year-old startup, valuing the company at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a US-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open-source large language model offers a less-expensive alternative to closed-source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking Machines Lab&lt;/strong&gt;: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s&amp;nbsp;$2 billion seed&amp;nbsp;round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflection:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s&amp;nbsp;$1.3 billion&amp;nbsp;round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders,&amp;nbsp;paying $620 million&amp;nbsp;for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nscale&lt;/strong&gt;: After the startup’s&amp;nbsp;$1.1 billion round&amp;nbsp;in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s&amp;nbsp;$433 million SAFE&amp;nbsp;funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after&amp;nbsp;spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Akorn Energy, is building data centers in the UK and Norway for&amp;nbsp;OpenAI’s Stargate project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wayve:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a&amp;nbsp;$1.05 billion round&amp;nbsp;for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an dditional&amp;nbsp;$500 million&amp;nbsp;in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure AI:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In September,&amp;nbsp;Nvidia participated in the Figure AI’s Series C funding round of&amp;nbsp;over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion.&amp;nbsp;The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised&amp;nbsp;a $675 million&amp;nbsp;Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale AI:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest&amp;nbsp;$1 billion&amp;nbsp;in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion.&amp;nbsp;In June, Meta invested&amp;nbsp;$14.3 billion&amp;nbsp;for a 49% stake of Scale, and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-club"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commonwealth Fusion&lt;/strong&gt;: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s &amp;nbsp;$863 million funding round&amp;nbsp;in August 2025. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crusoe:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;A startup building data centers&amp;nbsp;reportedly&amp;nbsp;to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI&amp;nbsp;raised $686 million&amp;nbsp;in November 2024, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cohere&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;The chipmaker has invested in enterprise large language model provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the&amp;nbsp;$500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perplexity&lt;/strong&gt;: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup,&amp;nbsp;including the&amp;nbsp;$500 million&amp;nbsp;round closed in December 2024.&amp;nbsp;The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent&amp;nbsp;$200 million fundraise&amp;nbsp;in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poolside:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In October 2024, the&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;AI&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised&amp;nbsp;$500 million&amp;nbsp;led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambda:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a&amp;nbsp;$480 million Series D&amp;nbsp;at a reported&amp;nbsp;$2.5 billion valuation&amp;nbsp;in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CoreWeave:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider&amp;nbsp;when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised&amp;nbsp;$221 million&amp;nbsp;in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Together AI:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In February, Nvidia participated in the&amp;nbsp;$305 million Series B&amp;nbsp;of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company&amp;nbsp;for the first time&amp;nbsp;in 2023.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firmus Technologies:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received&amp;nbsp;A$330 million&amp;nbsp;(approximately $215 million USD) in funding at a&amp;nbsp;A$1.85 billion&amp;nbsp;($1.2 billion USD) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient ‘AI factory’ in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sakana AI:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In September 2024, Nvidia invested in&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;the&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive&amp;nbsp;Series A round of about $214 million&amp;nbsp;at a valuation of $1.5 billion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuro&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;In August, Nvidia participated in the&amp;nbsp;$203 million&amp;nbsp;funding round for the self-driving startup focused on delivery. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imbue:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The AI research lab that&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a&amp;nbsp;$200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waabi:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a&amp;nbsp;$200 million Series B&amp;nbsp;round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deals-of-over-a-100-million"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deals of over a $100 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ayar Labs:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In December, Nvidia invested in the&amp;nbsp;$155 million round&amp;nbsp;of Ayar Labs, a&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kore.ai:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised&amp;nbsp;$150 million&amp;nbsp;in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox AQ:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested&amp;nbsp;$150 million&amp;nbsp;in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hippocratic AI:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January&amp;nbsp;that it raised a&amp;nbsp;$141 million Series B&amp;nbsp;at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weka:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a&amp;nbsp;$140 million&amp;nbsp;round for AI-native data management platform Weka.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runway:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s&amp;nbsp;$308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production&amp;nbsp;at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in&amp;nbsp;since 2023.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bright Machines:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a&amp;nbsp;$126 million Series C&amp;nbsp;of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enfabrica:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s&amp;nbsp;$125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reka AI&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;In July, an AI research lab Reka, raised&amp;nbsp;$110 million&amp;nbsp;in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia.&amp;nbsp;The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to&amp;nbsp;over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was first published in January 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2183848501.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia.
