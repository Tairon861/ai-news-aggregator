  &lt;p class="gdm-rich-text__subtitle"&gt;Our new method could help mathematicians leverage AI techniques to tackle long-standing challenges in mathematics, physics and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, mathematicians have developed complex equations to describe the fundamental physics involved in fluid dynamics. These laws govern everything from the swirling vortex of a hurricane to airflow lifting an airplane’s wing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts can carefully craft scenarios that make theory go against practice, leading to situations which could never physically happen. These situations, such as when quantities like velocity or pressure become infinite, are called ‘singularities’ or ‘blow ups’. They help mathematicians identify fundamental limitations in the equations of fluid dynamics, and help improve our understanding of how the physical world functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new paper, we introduce an entirely new family of mathematical blow ups to some of the most complex equations that describe fluid motion. We’re publishing this work in collaboration with mathematicians and geophysicists from institutions including Brown University, New York University and Stanford University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our approach presents a new way to leverage AI techniques to tackle longstanding challenges in mathematics, physics and engineering that demand unprecedented accuracy and interpretability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The importance of unstable singularities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stability is a crucial aspect of singularity formation. A singularity is considered stable if it is robust to small changes. Conversely, an unstable singularity requires extremely precise conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s expected that unstable singularities play a major role in foundational questions in fluid dynamics because mathematicians believe no stable singularities exist for the complex boundary-free 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Finding any singularity in the Navier-Stokes equations is one of the six famous Millennium Prize Problems that are still unsolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With our novel AI methods, we presented the first systematic discovery of new families of unstable singularities across three different fluid equations. We also observed a pattern emerging as the solutions become increasingly unstable. The number characterizing the speed of the blow up, lambda (λ), can be plotted against the order of instability, which is the number of unique ways the solution can deviate from the blow up. The pattern was visible in two of the equations studied, the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and Boussinesq equations. This suggests the existence of more unstable solutions, whose hypothesized lambda values lie along the same line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We discovered these singularies by incorporating machine learning techniques such as second order optimizers for training neural networks. These methods allowed us to refine our accuracy to an unprecedented level. For reference, our largest errors addressed are equivalent to predicting the diameter of the Earth to within a few centimeters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show an example of the vorticity (Ω) field found for one of the equations studied. This is a measure of how much the fluid is spinning at each point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We also show a one-dimensional slice through the same field along an axis for all of the instabilities we discovered, showing the evolution of increasingly unstable singularities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Novel method navigates a vast landscape of singularities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our approach is based on the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Unlike conventional neural networks that learn from vast datasets, we trained our models to match equations which model the laws of physics. The network's output is constantly checked against what the physical equations expect, and it learns by minimizing its ‘residual’, the amount by which its solution fails to satisfy the equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our use of PINNs goes beyond their typical role as general-purpose tools used for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). By embedding mathematical insights directly into the training, we were able to capture elusive solutions — such as unstable singularities — that have long-challenged conventional methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we developed a high-precision framework that pushes PINNs to near-machine precision, enabling the level of accuracy required for rigorous computer-assisted proofs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new era of computer-assisted mathematics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough represents a new way of doing mathematical research, combining deep mathematical insights with cutting-edge AI. We’re excited for this work to help usher in a new era where long-standing challenges are tackled with AI and computer-assisted proofs.&lt;/p&gt;

					NVIDIA Blackwell’s scale-up capabilities set the stage to scale out the world’s largest AI factories.

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Blackwell architecture is the reigning leader of the AI revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many think of Blackwell as a chip, but it may be better to think of it as a platform powering large-scale AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;


&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surging Demand and Model Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackwell is the core of an entire system architecture designed specifically to power AI factories that produce intelligence using the largest and most complex AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s frontier AI models have hundreds of billions of parameters and are estimated to serve nearly a billion users per week. The next generation of models are expected to have well over a trillion parameters — and are being trained on tens of trillions of tokens of data drawn from text, image and video datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling out a data center — harnessing up to thousands of computers to share the work — is necessary to meet this demand. But far greater performance and energy efficiency can come from first scaling up: by making a bigger computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackwell redefines the limits of just how big we can go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;


&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today’s Most Challenging Form of Computing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI factories are the machines of the next industrial revolution. Their work is AI inference — the most challenging form of computing known today — and their product is intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These factories require infrastructure that can adapt, scale out and maximize every bit of compute resource available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A symphony of compute, networking, storage, power and cooling — with integration at the silicon and systems levels, up and down racks — orchestrated by software that sees tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs as one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new unit of the data center is NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, a rack-scale system that acts as a single, massive GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth of a Superchip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core, the NVIDIA Grace Blackwell superchip unites two Blackwell GPUs with one NVIDIA Grace CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fusing them into a unified compute module — a superchip — boosts performance by an order of magnitude. To do so requires a new high-speed interconnect technology introduced with the NVIDIA Hopper architecture: NVIDIA NVLink chip-to-chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology unlocks seamless communication between the CPU and GPUs, enabling them to share memory directly, resulting in lower latency and higher throughput for AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			It takes a symphony of creation, cutting, assembly and inspection to build a superchip.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;


&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A New Interconnect for the Superchip Era&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling this performance across multiple superchips without bottlenecks was impossible with previous networking technology. So NVIDIA created a new kind of interconnect to keep performance bottlenecks from emerging and enable AI at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Backbone That Clears Bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA NVLink Switch spine anchors GB200 NVL72 with a precisely engineered web of over 5,000 high-performance copper cables, connecting 72 GPUs across 18 compute trays to move data at a staggering 130 TB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s fast enough to transfer the entire internet’s peak traffic in less than a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			Two miles of copper wire is precisely cut, measured, assembled and tested to create the blisteringly fast NVIDIA NVLink Switch spine.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			The spine cartridge is inspected before installation.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			The spine, powered up, can move an entire internet’s worth of data in less than a second.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;


&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building One Giant GPU for Inference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of all this advanced hardware and software, compute and networking enables GB200 NVL72 systems to unlock new possibilities for AI at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each rack weighs one-and-a-half tons — featuring more than 600,000 parts, two miles of wire and millions of lines of code converged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It acts as one giant virtual GPU, making factory-scale AI inference possible, where every nanosecond and watt matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="alt" class="full-width-layout__image" height="1080" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/12-full-rack-install.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;

&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GB200 NVL72 Everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA then deconstructed GB200 NVL72 so that partners and customers can configure and build their own NVL72 systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each NVL72 system is a two-ton, 1.2-million-part supercomputer. NVL72 systems are manufactured across more than 150 factories worldwide with 200 technology partners.&lt;/p&gt;

			From cloud giants to system builders, partners worldwide are producing NVIDIA Blackwell NVL72 systems.		&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;


&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to Scale Out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of Blackwell NVL72 systems converge to create AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working together isn’t enough. They must work as one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet and Quantum-X800 InfiniBand switches make this unified effort possible at the data center level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each GPU in an NVL72 system is connected directly to the factory’s data network, and to every other GPU in the system. GB200 NVL72 systems offer 400 Gbps of Ethernet or InfiniBand interconnect using NVIDIA ConnectX-7 NICs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			NVIDIA Quantum-X800 Switch, NVLink Switch, and Spectrum-X Ethernet unify one or many NVL72 systems to function as one.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening Lines of Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling out AI factories requires many tools, each in service of one thing: unrestricted, parallel communication for every AI workload in the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs do their part to boost AI performance by offloading and accelerating the non-AI tasks that keep the factory running: the symphony of networking, storage and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AI Factory Operating System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data center is now the computer. NVIDIA Dynamo is its operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamo orchestrates and coordinates AI inference requests across a large fleet of GPUs to ensure that AI factories run at the lowest possible cost to maximize productivity and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can add, remove and shift GPUs across workloads in response to surges in customer use, and route queries to the GPUs best fit for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;

			Colossus, xAI’s AI supercomputer. Created in 122 days, it houses over 200,000 NVIDIA GPUs — an example of a full-stack, scale-out architecture.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackwell is more than a chip. It’s the engine of AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s largest-planned computing clusters are being built on the Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra architectures — with approximately 1,000 racks of NVIDIA GB300 systems produced each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Blackwell architecture is the reigning leader of the AI revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many think of Blackwell as a chip, but it may be better to think of it as a platform powering large-scale AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;


&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surging Demand and Model Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackwell is the core of an entire system architecture designed specifically to power AI factories that produce intelligence using the largest and most complex AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s frontier AI models have hundreds of billions of parameters and are estimated to serve nearly a billion users per week. The next generation of models are expected to have well over a trillion parameters — and are being trained on tens of trillions of tokens of data drawn from text, image and video datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling out a data center — harnessing up to thousands of computers to share the work — is necessary to meet this demand. But far greater performance and energy efficiency can come from first scaling up: by making a bigger computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackwell redefines the limits of just how big we can go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today’s Most Challenging Form of Computing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI factories are the machines of the next industrial revolution. Their work is AI inference — the most challenging form of computing known today — and their product is intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These factories require infrastructure that can adapt, scale out and maximize every bit of compute resource available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A symphony of compute, networking, storage, power and cooling — with integration at the silicon and systems levels, up and down racks — orchestrated by software that sees tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs as one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new unit of the data center is NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, a rack-scale system that acts as a single, massive GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth of a Superchip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core, the NVIDIA Grace Blackwell superchip unites two Blackwell GPUs with one NVIDIA Grace CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fusing them into a unified compute module — a superchip — boosts performance by an order of magnitude. To do so requires a new high-speed interconnect technology introduced with the NVIDIA Hopper architecture: NVIDIA NVLink chip-to-chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology unlocks seamless communication between the CPU and GPUs, enabling them to share memory directly, resulting in lower latency and higher throughput for AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			It takes a symphony of creation, cutting, assembly and inspection to build a superchip.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;


&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A New Interconnect for the Superchip Era&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling this performance across multiple superchips without bottlenecks was impossible with previous networking technology. So NVIDIA created a new kind of interconnect to keep performance bottlenecks from emerging and enable AI at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;video class="full-width-layout__video js-responsive-video" loop="loop"&gt;Your browser does not support the video tag.&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Backbone That Clears Bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA NVLink Switch spine anchors GB200 NVL72 with a precisely engineered web of over 5,000 high-performance copper cables, connecting 72 GPUs across 18 compute trays to move data at a staggering 130 TB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s fast enough to transfer the entire internet’s peak traffic in less than a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="alt" class="full-width-layout__image" height="1080" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/10-amphnol-spine.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;	
	
&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			Two miles of copper wire is precisely cut, measured, assembled and tested to create the blisteringly fast NVIDIA NVLink Switch spine.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="alt" class="full-width-layout__image" height="1080" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/11-engineer-holding-appliance.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;	
	
&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			The spine cartridge is inspected before installation.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			The spine, powered up, can move an entire internet’s worth of data in less than a second.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;


&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building One Giant GPU for Inference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of all this advanced hardware and software, compute and networking enables GB200 NVL72 systems to unlock new possibilities for AI at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each rack weighs one-and-a-half tons — featuring more than 600,000 parts, two miles of wire and millions of lines of code converged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It acts as one giant virtual GPU, making factory-scale AI inference possible, where every nanosecond and watt matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="alt" class="full-width-layout__image" height="1080" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/12-full-rack-install.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;

&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GB200 NVL72 Everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA then deconstructed GB200 NVL72 so that partners and customers can configure and build their own NVL72 systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each NVL72 system is a two-ton, 1.2-million-part supercomputer. NVL72 systems are manufactured across more than 150 factories worldwide with 200 technology partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="alt" class="full-width-layout__image" height="1080" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/15-mgx-ecosystem.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;
	
	
&lt;p&gt;
	
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-credits"&gt;
			From cloud giants to system builders, partners worldwide are producing NVIDIA Blackwell NVL72 systems.		&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;


&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to Scale Out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of Blackwell NVL72 systems converge to create AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working together isn’t enough. They must work as one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet and Quantum-X800 InfiniBand switches make this unified effort possible at the data center level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each GPU in an NVL72 system is connected directly to the factory’s data network, and to every other GPU in the system. GB200 NVL72 systems offer 400 Gbps of Ethernet or InfiniBand interconnect using NVIDIA ConnectX-7 NICs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="alt" class="full-width-layout__image" height="960" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18-time-to-scale-out-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	
&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			NVIDIA Quantum-X800 Switch, NVLink Switch, and Spectrum-X Ethernet unify one or many NVL72 systems to function as one.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__50-50-image-row-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="alt" class="full-width-layout__50-50-image-row-image" height="1152" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/19A-data-center-beauty-shot-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="full-width-layout__50-50-image-row-image" height="1152" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/19B-data-center-beauty-shot-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening Lines of Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling out AI factories requires many tools, each in service of one thing: unrestricted, parallel communication for every AI workload in the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs do their part to boost AI performance by offloading and accelerating the non-AI tasks that keep the factory running: the symphony of networking, storage and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 powers an AI factory by CoreWeave, an NVIDIA Cloud Partner.		&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;


&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AI Factory Operating System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data center is now the computer. NVIDIA Dynamo is its operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamo orchestrates and coordinates AI inference requests across a large fleet of GPUs to ensure that AI factories run at the lowest possible cost to maximize productivity and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can add, remove and shift GPUs across workloads in response to surges in customer use, and route queries to the GPUs best fit for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="alt" class="full-width-layout__image" height="1094" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/23-xAI-Collossus-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;

			&lt;span class="full-width-layout__media-caption-callout"&gt;
			Colossus, xAI’s AI supercomputer. Created in 122 days, it houses over 200,000 NVIDIA GPUs — an example of a full-stack, scale-out architecture.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section dark"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackwell is more than a chip. It’s the engine of AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s largest-planned computing clusters are being built on the Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra architectures — with approximately 1,000 racks of NVIDIA GB300 systems produced each week.&lt;/p&gt;

What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tightens-chatgpt-rules-for-teens-amid-safety-concerns"&gt;OpenAI tightens ChatGPT rules for teens amid safety concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns about the mental health risks of AI companions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-codex-to-power-smarter-ai-coding"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT-5-Codex to power smarter AI coding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out GPT-5-Codex, a new version of its AI coding agent that can spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours tackling a task, depending on complexity. The company says this dynamic approach helps the model outperform GPT-5 on key coding benchmarks, including bug fixes and large-scale refactoring. The update comes as OpenAI looks to keep Codex competitive in a fast-growing market that now includes rivals like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reshuffles-team-behind-chatgpt-s-personality"&gt;OpenAI reshuffles team behind ChatGPT’s personality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is shaking up its Model Behavior team, the small but influential group that helps shape how its AI interacts with people The roughly 14-person team is being folded into the larger Post Training group, now reporting to lead researcher Max Schwarzer. Meanwhile, founding leader Joanne Jang is spinning up a new unit called OAI Labs, focused on prototyping fresh ways for people to collaborate with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="august2025"&gt;August 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-strengthen-chatgpt-safeguards-after-teen-suicide-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to strengthen ChatGPT safeguards after teen suicide lawsuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children’s use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xai-claims-apple-s-app-store-practices-give-openai-an-unfair-advantage"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xAI claims Apple’s App Store practices give OpenAI an unfair advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-targets-india-with-cheaper-monthly-chatgpt-subscription"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI targets India with cheaper monthly ChatGPT subscription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI’s presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-mobile-app-hits-2b-in-revenue-2-91-earned-per-install"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT mobile app hits $2B in revenue, $2.91 earned per install&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT’s mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-keeps-multiple-gpt-models-despite-gpt-5-launch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI keeps multiple GPT models despite GPT-5 launch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-altman-addresses-gpt-5-glitches-and-chart-crime-during-reddit-ama"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Altman addresses GPT-5 glitches and “chart crime” during Reddit AMA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5’s “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-5-a-smarter-task-ready-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-5, a smarter, task-ready ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that’s not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-enterprise-to-federal-agencies-for-just-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Enterprise to federal agencies for just $1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-returns-to-open-source-with-new-ai-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI returns to open source with new AI models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-nears-700m-weekly-users-quadruples-growth-in-a-year"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT nears 700M weekly users, quadruples growth in a year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI’s VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app’s growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-has-study-mode"&gt;ChatGPT now has study mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-warns-that-chatgpt-therapy-isn-t-confidential"&gt;Altman warns that ChatGPT therapy isn’t confidential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-2-5b-prompts-daily"&gt;ChatGPT hits 2.5B prompts daily&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt"&gt;OpenAI launches a general-purpose agent in ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-warns-of-major-risks-with-ai-therapy-chatbots"&gt;Study warns of major risks with AI therapy chatbots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-delays-releasing-its-open-model-again"&gt;OpenAI delays releasing its open model again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we planned to launch our open-weight model next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) July 12, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-is-testing-a-mysterious-new-feature-called-study-together"&gt;ChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called “study together”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-referrals-from-chatgpt-to-news-sites-are-rising-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news sites are rising but not enough to offset search declines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="june2025"&gt;June 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-uses-google-s-ai-chips-to-power-its-products"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI uses Google’s AI chips to power its products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-energy-needed-for-an-average-chatgpt-query-can-power-a-lightbulb-for-a-couple-of-minutes"&gt;The energy needed for an average ChatGPT query can power a lightbulb for a couple of minutes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o3-pro-an-upgraded-version-of-its-o3-ai-reasoning-model"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has launched o3-pro, an upgraded version of its o3 AI reasoning model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.…&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 10, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-conversational-voice-mode-has-been-upgraded"&gt;ChatGPT’s conversational voice mode has been upgraded&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-added-new-features-like-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT has added new features like meeting recording and connectors for Google Drive, Box, and more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cfo-says-hardware-will-drive-chatgpt-s-growth"&gt;OpenAI CFO says hardware will drive ChatGPT’s growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI’s reach to a larger audience in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-chatgpt-unveils-its-ai-coding-agent-codex"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT unveils its AI coding agent, Codex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-altman-aims-to-make-chatgpt-more-personalized-by-tracking-every-aspect-of-a-person-s-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Altman aims to make ChatGPT more personalized by tracking every aspect of a person’s life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-releases-its-gpt-4-1-and-gpt-4-1-mini-ai-models-in-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI releases its GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini AI models in ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks &amp;amp; instruction following.

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-deep-research-now-connects-with-github-in-beta-to-answer-code-related-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT deep research now connects with GitHub (in beta) to answer code-related questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-new-data-residency-program-in-asia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches a new data residency program in Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-introduce-a-program-to-grow-ai-infrastructure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to introduce a program to grow AI infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company’s expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-promises-to-make-changes-to-prevent-future-chatgpt-sycophancy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april-2025"&gt;April 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-clarifies-the-reason-chatgpt-became-overly-flattering-and-agreeable"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-to-fix-a-bug-that-let-minors-engage-in-inappropriate-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-helps-users-by-giving-recommendations-showing-images-and-reviewing-products-for-online-shopping"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is continually updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2191707579.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tightens-chatgpt-rules-for-teens-amid-safety-concerns"&gt;OpenAI tightens ChatGPT rules for teens amid safety concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns about the mental health risks of AI companions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-codex-to-power-smarter-ai-coding"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT-5-Codex to power smarter AI coding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out GPT-5-Codex, a new version of its AI coding agent that can spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours tackling a task, depending on complexity. The company says this dynamic approach helps the model outperform GPT-5 on key coding benchmarks, including bug fixes and large-scale refactoring. The update comes as OpenAI looks to keep Codex competitive in a fast-growing market that now includes rivals like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reshuffles-team-behind-chatgpt-s-personality"&gt;OpenAI reshuffles team behind ChatGPT’s personality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is shaking up its Model Behavior team, the small but influential group that helps shape how its AI interacts with people The roughly 14-person team is being folded into the larger Post Training group, now reporting to lead researcher Max Schwarzer. Meanwhile, founding leader Joanne Jang is spinning up a new unit called OAI Labs, focused on prototyping fresh ways for people to collaborate with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="august2025"&gt;August 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-strengthen-chatgpt-safeguards-after-teen-suicide-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to strengthen ChatGPT safeguards after teen suicide lawsuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children’s use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xai-claims-apple-s-app-store-practices-give-openai-an-unfair-advantage"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xAI claims Apple’s App Store practices give OpenAI an unfair advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-targets-india-with-cheaper-monthly-chatgpt-subscription"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI targets India with cheaper monthly ChatGPT subscription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI’s presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-mobile-app-hits-2b-in-revenue-2-91-earned-per-install"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT mobile app hits $2B in revenue, $2.91 earned per install&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT’s mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-keeps-multiple-gpt-models-despite-gpt-5-launch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI keeps multiple GPT models despite GPT-5 launch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5’s “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-5-a-smarter-task-ready-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-5, a smarter, task-ready ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that’s not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-enterprise-to-federal-agencies-for-just-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Enterprise to federal agencies for just $1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-returns-to-open-source-with-new-ai-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI returns to open source with new AI models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-nears-700m-weekly-users-quadruples-growth-in-a-year"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT nears 700M weekly users, quadruples growth in a year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI’s VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app’s growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-has-study-mode"&gt;ChatGPT now has study mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-warns-that-chatgpt-therapy-isn-t-confidential"&gt;Altman warns that ChatGPT therapy isn’t confidential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-2-5b-prompts-daily"&gt;ChatGPT hits 2.5B prompts daily&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt"&gt;OpenAI launches a general-purpose agent in ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-warns-of-major-risks-with-ai-therapy-chatbots"&gt;Study warns of major risks with AI therapy chatbots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-delays-releasing-its-open-model-again"&gt;OpenAI delays releasing its open model again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-is-testing-a-mysterious-new-feature-called-study-together"&gt;ChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called “study together”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-referrals-from-chatgpt-to-news-sites-are-rising-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news sites are rising but not enough to offset search declines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="june2025"&gt;June 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-uses-google-s-ai-chips-to-power-its-products"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI uses Google’s AI chips to power its products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-energy-needed-for-an-average-chatgpt-query-can-power-a-lightbulb-for-a-couple-of-minutes"&gt;The energy needed for an average ChatGPT query can power a lightbulb for a couple of minutes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cfo-says-hardware-will-drive-chatgpt-s-growth"&gt;OpenAI CFO says hardware will drive ChatGPT’s growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI’s reach to a larger audience in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-chatgpt-unveils-its-ai-coding-agent-codex"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT unveils its AI coding agent, Codex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-altman-aims-to-make-chatgpt-more-personalized-by-tracking-every-aspect-of-a-person-s-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Altman aims to make ChatGPT more personalized by tracking every aspect of a person’s life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-releases-its-gpt-4-1-and-gpt-4-1-mini-ai-models-in-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI releases its GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini AI models in ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks &amp;amp; instruction following. Because it’s faster, it’s a great alternative to OpenAI o3 &amp;amp; o4-mini for everyday coding needs.&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 14, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-deep-research-now-connects-with-github-in-beta-to-answer-code-related-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT deep research now connects with GitHub (in beta) to answer code-related questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-new-data-residency-program-in-asia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches a new data residency program in Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-introduce-a-program-to-grow-ai-infrastructure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to introduce a program to grow AI infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company’s expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-promises-to-make-changes-to-prevent-future-chatgpt-sycophancy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april-2025"&gt;April 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-clarifies-the-reason-chatgpt-became-overly-flattering-and-agreeable"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-to-fix-a-bug-that-let-minors-engage-in-inappropriate-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-helps-users-by-giving-recommendations-showing-images-and-reviewing-products-for-online-shopping"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;

Two former leaders of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explained the reasons for their sudden departures from the agency in a Senate hearing. And they described how CDC employees are being instructed to turn their backs on scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The CDC’s former director Susan Monarez and former chief medical officer Debra Houry took questions from a Senate committee on Wednesday. &lt;strong&gt;They painted a picture of a health agency in turmoil—and at risk of harming the people it is meant to serve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, an advisory CDC panel that develops vaccine guidance met for a two-day discussion on multiple childhood vaccines. During the meeting, which was underway as &lt;em&gt;The Checkup&lt;/em&gt; went to press, members of the panel were set to discuss those vaccines and propose recommendations on their use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Monarez worries that access to childhood vaccines is under threat—and that the public health consequences could be dire. “If vaccine protections are weakened, preventable diseases will return,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As the current secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. oversees federal health and science agencies that include the CDC, which monitors and responds to threats to public health. Part of that role involves developing vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we’ve noted before, RFK Jr. has long been a prominent critic of vaccines.&lt;/strong&gt; He has incorrectly linked commonly used ingredients to autism and made other incorrect statements about risks associated with various vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Still, he oversaw the recruitment of Monarez—who does not share those beliefs—to lead the agency. When she was sworn in on July 31, Monarez, who is a microbiologist and immunologist, had already been serving as acting director of the agency. She had held prominent positions at other federal agencies and departments too, including the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Kennedy&amp;nbsp;described her as “a public health expert with unimpeachable scientific credentials.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His opinion seems to have changed somewhat since then. &lt;/strong&gt;Just 29 days after Monarez took on her position, she was turfed out of the agency. And in yesterday’s hearing, she explained why.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On August 25, Kennedy asked Monarez to do two things, she said. First, he wanted her to commit to firing scientists at the agency. And second, he wanted her to “pre-commit” to approve vaccine recommendations made by the agency’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), regardless of whether there was any scientific evidence to support those recommendations, she said. “He just wanted blanket approval,” she said during her testimony.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She refused both requests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Monarez testified that she didn’t want to get rid of hardworking scientists who played an important role in keeping Americans safe. And she said she could not commit to approving vaccine recommendations without reviewing the scientific evidence behind them and maintain her integrity. She was sacked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those vaccine recommendations are currently under discussion, and scientists like Monarez are worried about how they might change. Kennedy fired all 17 members of the previous committee in June. (Monarez said she was not consulted on the firings and found out about them through media reports.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A clean sweep is needed to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science,” Kennedy wrote in&amp;nbsp;a piece for the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; at the time. &lt;/strong&gt;He went on to replace those individuals with eight new members, some of whom have been prominent vaccine critics and&amp;nbsp;have spread misinformation about vaccines. One later withdrew.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That new panel met two weeks later. The&amp;nbsp;meeting included a presentation about thimerosal—a chemical that Kennedy has incorrectly linked to autism, and which is no longer included in vaccines in the US—and a proposal to recommend that the MMRV vaccine (for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) not be offered to children under the age of four.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week,&amp;nbsp;five new committee members were named. They include&amp;nbsp;individuals who have advocated against vaccine mandates and who have argued that mRNA-based covid vaccines should be removed from the market.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All 12 members are convening for a meeting that runs today and tomorrow.&lt;/strong&gt; At that meeting, members will propose recommendations for the MMRV vaccine and vaccines for covid-19 and hepatitis B, according to an agenda published on the CDC website.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those are the recommendations for which Monarez says she was asked to provide “blanket approval.” “My worst fear is that I would then be in a position of approving something that reduces access [to] lifesaving vaccines to children and others who need them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That job now goes to Jim O’Neill, the deputy health secretary and acting CDC director (also a longevity enthusiast), who now holds the authority to approve those recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don’t yet know what those recommendations will be. But if they are approved, they could reshape access to vaccines for children and vulnerable people in the US. &lt;/strong&gt;As&amp;nbsp;six former chairs of the committee wrote for &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt;: “ACIP is directly linked to the Vaccines for Children program, which provides vaccines without cost to approximately 50% of children in the US, and the Affordable Care Act that requires insurance coverage for ACIP-recommended vaccines to approximately 150 million people in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Drops in vaccine uptake have already contributed to this year’s measles outbreak in the US, which is the biggest in decades. Two children have died. We are already seeing the impact of undermined trust in childhood vaccines.

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The face-palm-worthy prompt injections against AI assistants continue. Today’s installment hits OpenAI’s Deep Research agent. Researchers recently devised an attack that plucked confidential information out of a user’s Gmail inbox and sent it to an attacker-controlled web server, with no interaction required on the part of the victim and no sign of exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Research is a ChatGPT-integrated AI agent that OpenAI introduced earlier this year. As its name is meant to convey, Deep Research performs complex, multi-step research on the Internet by tapping into a large array of resources, including a user’s email inbox, documents, and other resources. It can also autonomously browse websites and click on links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user can prompt the agent to search through the past month’s emails, cross-reference them with information found on the web, and use them to compile a detailed report on a given topic. OpenAI says that it “accomplishes in tens of minutes what would take a human many hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out there's a downside to having a large language model browse websites and click on links with no human supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, security firm Radware published research showing how a garden-variety attack known as a prompt injection is all it took for company researchers to exfiltrate confidential information when Deep Research was given access to a target’s Gmail inbox. This type of integration is precisely what Deep Research was designed to do—and something OpenAI has encouraged. Radware has dubbed the attack Shadow Leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ShadowLeak weaponizes the very capabilities that make AI assistants useful: email access, tool use and autonomous web calls,” Radware researchers wrote. “It results in silent data loss and unlogged actions performed ‘on behalf of the user,’ bypassing traditional security controls that assume intentional user clicks or data leakage prevention at the gateway level.”&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ShadowLeak starts where most attacks on LLMs do—with an indirect prompt injection. These prompts are tucked inside content such as documents and emails sent by untrusted people. They contain instructions to perform actions the user never asked for, and like a Jedi mind trick, they are tremendously effective in persuading the LLM to do things that are harmful. Prompt injections exploit an LLM’s inherent need to please its user. Following instructions has been so ingrained into the bots' behavior that they’ll carry them out no matter who asks, even a threat actor in a malicious email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, prompt injections have proved impossible to prevent. That has left OpenAI and the rest of the LLM market reliant on mitigations that are often introduced on a case-by-case basis and only in response to the discovery of a working exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, OpenAI mitigated the prompt-injection technique ShadowLeak fell to—but only after Radware privately alerted the LLM maker to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proof-of-concept attack that Radware published embedded a prompt injection into an email sent to a Gmail account that Deep Research had been given access to. The injection included instructions to scan received emails related to a company’s human resources department for the names and addresses of employees. Deep Research dutifully followed those instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, ChatGPT and most other LLMs have mitigated such attacks, not by squashing prompt injections, but rather by blocking the channels the prompt injections use to exfiltrate confidential information. Specifically, these mitigations work by requiring explicit user consent before an AI assistant can click links or use markdown links—which are the normal ways to smuggle information off of a user environment and into the hands of the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Deep Research also refused. But when the researchers invoked browser.open—a tool Deep Research offers for autonomous Web surfing—they cleared the hurdle. Specifically, the injection directed the agent to open the link https://compliance.hr-service.net/public-employee-lookup/ and append parameters to it. The injection defined the parameters as an employee’s name and address. When Deep Research complied, it opened the link and, in the process, exfiltrated the information to the event log of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The face-palm-worthy prompt injections against AI assistants continue. Today’s installment hits OpenAI’s Deep Research agent. Researchers recently devised an attack that plucked confidential information out of a user’s Gmail inbox and sent it to an attacker-controlled web server, with no interaction required on the part of the victim and no sign of exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Research is a ChatGPT-integrated AI agent that OpenAI introduced earlier this year. As its name is meant to convey, Deep Research performs complex, multi-step research on the Internet by tapping into a large array of resources, including a user’s email inbox, documents, and other resources. It can also autonomously browse websites and click on links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user can prompt the agent to search through the past month’s emails, cross-reference them with information found on the web, and use them to compile a detailed report on a given topic. OpenAI says that it “accomplishes in tens of minutes what would take a human many hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out there's a downside to having a large language model browse websites and click on links with no human supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, security firm Radware published research showing how a garden-variety attack known as a prompt injection is all it took for company researchers to exfiltrate confidential information when Deep Research was given access to a target’s Gmail inbox. This type of integration is precisely what Deep Research was designed to do—and something OpenAI has encouraged. Radware has dubbed the attack Shadow Leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ShadowLeak weaponizes the very capabilities that make AI assistants useful: email access, tool use and autonomous web calls,” Radware researchers wrote. “It results in silent data loss and unlogged actions performed ‘on behalf of the user,’ bypassing traditional security controls that assume intentional user clicks or data leakage prevention at the gateway level.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;ShadowLeak starts where most attacks on LLMs do—with an indirect prompt injection. These prompts are tucked inside content such as documents and emails sent by untrusted people. They contain instructions to perform actions the user never asked for, and like a Jedi mind trick, they are tremendously effective in persuading the LLM to do things that are harmful. Prompt injections exploit an LLM’s inherent need to please its user. Following instructions has been so ingrained into the bots' behavior that they’ll carry them out no matter who asks, even a threat actor in a malicious email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, prompt injections have proved impossible to prevent. That has left OpenAI and the rest of the LLM market reliant on mitigations that are often introduced on a case-by-case basis and only in response to the discovery of a working exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, OpenAI mitigated the prompt-injection technique ShadowLeak fell to—but only after Radware privately alerted the LLM maker to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proof-of-concept attack that Radware published embedded a prompt injection into an email sent to a Gmail account that Deep Research had been given access to. The injection included instructions to scan received emails related to a company’s human resources department for the names and addresses of employees. Deep Research dutifully followed those instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, ChatGPT and most other LLMs have mitigated such attacks, not by squashing prompt injections, but rather by blocking the channels the prompt injections use to exfiltrate confidential information. Specifically, these mitigations work by requiring explicit user consent before an AI assistant can click links or use markdown links—which are the normal ways to smuggle information off of a user environment and into the hands of the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Deep Research also refused. But when the researchers invoked browser.open—a tool Deep Research offers for autonomous Web surfing—they cleared the hurdle. Specifically, the injection directed the agent to open the link https://compliance.hr-service.net/public-employee-lookup/ and append parameters to it. The injection defined the parameters as an employee’s name and address. When Deep Research complied, it opened the link and, in the process, exfiltrated the information to the event log of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

He also acknowledged that China is likely to lag behind in semiconductor manufacturing process nodes, “for a relatively long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s response to tariffs and trade embargoes is to advance infrastructure design and technology, plus it’s made the decision to open-source several large swathes of its software, including the openPangu foundation AI models and the Mind series SDKs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The new Ascends&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company plans to produces three new series of the Ascend chip, the 950, 960, and 970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ascend 950PR and 950TO will be cast from the same die, and provide additional support for low-precision data formats, including FP8 – where the 950 will deliver a PFLOP of performance, and MXFP8, rated at two PFLOPs. A PFLOP is one thousand trillion flotaing point calculations per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’ll also be better vector processing, and more granular memory access, down to 128 byte chunks from 512 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ascend 950 chips will offer 2 TB/s interconnect bandwidth, 2.5x more than the current Ascend 910C. The 950PR will be available Q1 2026, and the Ascend 950DT launches Q4 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available a year later in Q4 2027, the Ascend 960 will have twice the computing power, memory access bandwidth, memory capacity, and number of interconnect ports as the 950. It will support Huawei’s proprietary HiF4 data format, which, the company claims, brings greater precision than other FP4 technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most capable chip will be the Ascend 970, slated for release Q4 2028. Xu said, “We’re still working on some of its specs, but our general goal is to push all of its specs much higher.” He said it was expected that the Ascend 970 series will offer an interconnect bandwidth of 4TB/s, be capable of 8 PFLOPs of FP4, and will come with larger memory capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SuperPods of NPUs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s strategy is to offer hyperscalers clusters of raw compute in the form of SuperPoDs, which will appear begin to appear Q4 2026 in the form of the Atlas 950 SuperPoD, equipped with the new Ascend 950DT chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitor NVIDIA’s NVL144 system (a SuperPod analogue) will launch mid- to late-2026, and Huawei claims that its first SuperPoD will have 56.8 times more NPUs than GPUs in the NVL144, and deliver nearly seven times the processing power. Even with the scheduled arrival of the NVL576, which NVIDIA is set to release in 2027, the Atlas 950 SuperPoD will still be the better performer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;General computing chips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For general computing, Huawei plans to release two models of its Kunpeng 950 processors in Q1 2026, sporting 96 cores &amp;amp; 192 threads, and 192 cores &amp;amp; 384 threads in the faster of the two models. There will also be what Xu called “the wold’s first general-purpose computing SuperPoD,” the Kunpeng 950-based TaiShan 950 SuperPod, which will be available in the first quarter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Open-source connectivity protocol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NPU and general computing SuperPoDs will use UnifiedBus 2.0, the next iteration of the existing UnifiedBus 1.0. That’s the interconnection technology used by the Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD, which came into service in March this year, with over 300 installations to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UnifiedBus 2.0 is to be an open protocol, with the tech specifications released immediately to developer community. UnifiedBus 2.0 will be used internally in the new generations of SuperPods, and connect clusters of SuperPods, forming SuperClusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first cluster product is to be the Atlas 950 SuperCluster, offering 2.5 times more NPUs and 1.3 times more computing power than xAI’s Colossus, currently the world’s most powerful computing cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last quarter of 2027, Huawei intends to launch the Atlas 960 SuperCluster, which will integrate over a million NPUs and deliver 4 ZFLOPS in FP4 (with a ZFLOP representing 10^21 floating point operations per second). “SuperPoDs and SuperClusters powered by UnifiedBus are our answer to surging demand for computing, both today and tomorrow,” Xu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: Eric Xu, Huawei)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The tech giant also announced that it’s bringing agentic capabilities to Chrome in the future, adding its AI Mode search feature to the address bar, launching new Gemini features, using AI to combat AI-generated scams, rolling out automatic password resets, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;U.S. users who have their language set to English can now ask Gemini to clarify complex information on any web page they’re reading using the Gemini icon in the top-right corner of their Chrome window. For example, you could open up a page that features a banana bread recipe and ask Gemini to make the recipe gluten free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047330" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gemini-in-Chrome_make-sense-of-your-tabs.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gemini can now work across multiple tabs, allowing users to quickly compare and summarize information across multiple websites. For example, you could be planning your flight, hotel, and vacation in multiple tabs and work with Gemini to organize your trip. Or, you might be shopping for a new mattress and want to compare all of the different models you’re looking at in multiple tabs.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gemini will soon be able to retrieve web pages you’ve previously visited, making it easier to return to past browsing sessions without sifting through your browser history. That means you will be able to ask something like “On which site did I see the walnut desk last week?” or “What was that blog I read on back-to-school shopping?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047324" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-in-Chrome_YouTube-Integration.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, Google is launching a deeper integration between Gemini in Chrome and other Google apps, like Calendar, YouTube, and Maps. Google says this will allow users to do things like schedule meetings, see location details, and more without having to leave the page they’re on. For example, if you’re trying to find a specific spot in a YouTube video, you can ask Gemini to take you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google notes that the AI assistant will be able to complete tedious tasks, like booking a haircut or ordering weekly groceries. Gemini will navigate to the site, add things to your cart, and let you take the final action by checking out with your payment option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047323" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Instacart-example.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google says the new agentic capabilities will be available in Chrome in the coming months. It’s worth noting that OpenAI launched Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously, earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google is also bringing AI Mode, its advanced search feature, directly into the Chrome address bar. With AI Mode, users can ask complex questions with follow-ups to dig deeper into topics. For example, instead of searching for “best mattress,” you could type out “I’m a side sleeper with occasional lower back pain. Make me a table comparing the different mattress types” directly in the address bar. From there, you could ask follow-up questions and keep your search going with queries like, “How long do memory foam mattresses typically last?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This update will be rolling out later this month in English in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;and expanding to more countries and languages in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also coming to the address bar is the ability to ask questions about the page you’re on. Chrome can now suggest relevant questions based on the context of the page to kickstart your search in the address bar. Google says users will get a helpful AI Overview and the option to ask follow-up questions with AI Mode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047327" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-Mode_Contextual-Search.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says Chrome will also soon be able to use its Gemini Nano model to detect and protect against scams, such as fake virus alerts and fraudulent giveaways. These scams often impersonate trusted brands and use generative AI to create convincing phishing attempts, Google notes.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google also announced that it’s using AI to help users fix compromised passwords with a single click on supported sites, like Coursera, Spotify, Duolingo, H&amp;amp;M, and more.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The promise of glasses is to preserve this sense of presence that you have with other people,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the Meta Connect 2025 keynote. “I think that we’ve lost it a little bit with phones, and we have the opportunity to get it back with glasses.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In reality, Meta wants its own hardware to eat into the marketshare of Apple and Google so that it doesn’t have to keep siphoning profits to them via app stores. But nevertheless, this is the angle Meta is taking to sell its most sophisticated smart glasses yet, the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which the company hopes could one day eclipse the market share of smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta’s Reality Labs division burns cash at an alarming rate, which has concerned investors over the years. But Wednesday’s event finally showed us a glimpse of what the division’s $70 billion in losses since 2020 have gone toward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta has had its fair share of flops, like the entire promise of its social metaverse. (Remember when they announced that metaverse avatars would finally get legs?) But with the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Meta has created a remarkable piece of technology, unlike any other consumer-facing product on the market — we have yet to test it ourselves, so we can’t quite say just how groundbreaking this really is, but it looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like Meta’s existing smart glasses, which have sold millions of pairs, the new model has cameras, speakers, microphones, and an on-board AI assistant. The display on the glasses, which is offset so as not to obstruct one’s sightline, can display Meta apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, as well as directions and live translations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What most sets the Meta Ray-Ban Display apart is the Meta Neural Band, a wristband that uses surface electromyography (sEMG) to pick up on signals sent between your brain and your hand when performing a gesture. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta’s keynote didn’t get into the specifics of how Zuckerberg was writing these texts, but according to Reality Labs’ research on sEMG, users can write out messages like this by holding their fingers together as if they were gripping a pen and “writing” out the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While some live AI demos at the keynote failed — Zuckerberg blamed the Wi-Fi — we at least got to see the wristband in action, which is more novel. Zuckerberg quickly wrote out text messages, then sent them on his Ray-Bans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m up to about 30 words a minute on this,” Zuckerberg said onstage at the company’s Menlo Park headquarters. “You can get pretty fast.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On a touchscreen smartphone like an iPhone, research has estimated that people text at about 36 words per minute, making Zuckerberg’s claim impressive. Reality Labs’ research participants averaged closer to 21 words per minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike past Meta Ray-Bans, this technology allows people to actually use the glasses without speaking aloud, which isn’t always natural in public settings. While Apple Watch users can send texts without voice prompting, the process is so tedious and slow that it’s only useful as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other gesture controls on the wristband seem more similar to technology that consumers have used before, like Nintendo Joy-Cons and Apple Watches. But if the voiceless texting interface is as good as it seems, then the wristband will likely be capable of more complex gestures than we’re used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047149" height="382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-17-at-8.24.11PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta has invested heavily in research on sEMG since 2021, even showing us a prototype of a heftier product called Orion. Like Apple and Google, Meta is preparing for a not-so-impossible future where these smart glasses could potentially eclipse the smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But as is the risk with any massive hardware investment, there’s no way to know if this will actually feel more natural to people in their day-to-day lives than pulling a sleek aluminum rectangle out of their pocket to tap out messages to their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This might be Meta’s biggest bet — perhaps a bigger bet than its subpar metaverse. That’s why it’s so striking that Zuckerberg is unveiling this technology as not just a fascinating innovation, but something that he wants to portray as more prosocial than the smartphone. It’s a way for him to capitalize on our growing malaise with our ever-increasing screen time, even though he’s the one making the apps that demand our attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The technology needs to get out of the way,” Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Will the smartphone become an obsolete relic like a Nokia with a T9 keyboard? That depends on whether there’s truth to Zuckerberg’s narrative that these glasses will help us feel more present. But Meta and its competitors are betting big on the cultural shift from smartphones to smart glasses, and the Ray-Ban Display will give consumers their first taste of this possible future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;If you can’t resist the urge to check your phone over and over, even if you’re out with friends, Meta has a solution: check your glasses instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The promise of glasses is to preserve this sense of presence that you have with other people,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the Meta Connect 2025 keynote. “I think that we’ve lost it a little bit with phones, and we have the opportunity to get it back with glasses.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In reality, Meta wants its own hardware to eat into the marketshare of Apple and Google so that it doesn’t have to keep siphoning profits to them via app stores. But nevertheless, this is the angle Meta is taking to sell its most sophisticated smart glasses yet, the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which the company hopes could one day eclipse the market share of smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

The feature launched last year, initially as part of the Gemini Advanced paid subscription, allowing users to write instructions to create an AI chatbot for different scenarios. For instance, Google launched with premade Gems like a learning coach, a brainstorming assistant, a career guide, a writing editor, and a coding partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now Google says you’ll be able to share your Gems with friends, family, or co-workers as easily as you can share a file from Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This would make Gems more accessible to more people, as not everyone uses the advanced customization feature. It could also help prevent people from building the same Gems as others. For instance, if multiple co-workers were using a similar type of custom Gemini assistant, they could just share the same resource instead of each making their own version that could have slight inconsistencies between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google suggests Gem sharing could also be useful for people working on family vacation plans and guides, meal planners, or collaborative writing projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047366" height="555" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-12.31.50PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Google GEms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google (screenshot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To share a Gem, you’ll open the Gem manager on the web app and click the “Share” icon next to any Gem you’ve created. Also similar to Google Drive, you can control who can view and use your Gems and who’s allowed to edit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After first rolling out to Gemini Advanced, Gemini Business, and Gemini Enterprise subscribers in over 150 countries, Google announced in March that Gems were now available to everyone and could support file uploads.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google is making it possible to now share your Gemini Gems — custom AI assistants and experts designed for specific tasks — the company announced on Thursday.

The agent will draw on all of a user’s notion pages and database as context, automatically generating notes and analysis for meetings, competitor evaluation reports, and feedback landing pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The productivity platform said that the agent can create pages and databases, or update them with new data, properties, or views. Users can also trigger Notion agents from outside platforms that are linked to the service. For instance, you can ask the Notion agent to create a bug-tracking dashboard from various sources, including Slack, email, and Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047229" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/September2025_WhatsNew_BugTracker.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Notion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The newly announced Agent builds on Notion AI, a pre-existing feature that could search or summarize content. But the new agent is able to tackle more complex multistep tasks, using the powers of agentic AI. The company said that the current version of the agent can perform a task that runs up to 20 minutes across hundreds of pages.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can set up a “profile” page for the agent to instruct it to follow directions on referencing sources, style of output, and where to update tasks and final results. You’ll also be able to ask the agent to “remember” key points as people use them. Those memories will be stored on the profile page, and users can edit them there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047230" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/September2025_WhatsNew_AgentPersonalization.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Notion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In demo videos, the company gave examples of agents that could provide feedback for landing pages and update them, create a restaurant tracker, create an analysis from meeting notes, and prepare a competition analysis report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the moment, you have to trigger these actions manually. But Notion said that the ability to create customized agents that work on a schedule or triggers is coming soon. The company will also release a template library for agents so you can pick ready-made prompts that might suit your task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the last two years, Notion has released a calendar app, a Gmail client, a meeting note-taker, and an enterprise search to get information from different sources. These are features that gave the company enough contextual building blocks to create automations. Other enterprise knowledge and productivity platforms, including Salesforce, Fireflies, and Read AI have launched their own agents to extract and update information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The banquet seating chart included Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang; Apple CEO Tim Cook; venture capitalist and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks; Alphabet and Google president Ruth Porat; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff; and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, according to the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Thursday, the U.S. and U.K. signed a partnership called the Tech Prosperity Deal to focus on developing nuclear, AI, and quantum technologies. Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and OpenAI also made announcements earlier this week to build data centers in the U.K., while CoreWeave and Salesforce announced a multibillion-pound investment in the country. Overall, American tech firms committed a total of £31 billion ($42 billion) to boost AI infrastructure in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This state banquet guest list seems to have featured more tech and business names than the Hollywood types that often attend such affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This change reveals the shifting economic needs of the U.K. and U.S. in the age of AI, as well as the rising prominence of technology and its leaders in Trump’s second administration. Just this past year, numerous Big Tech companies like OpenAI, Google, and Apple have pledged to work with the government, from providing AI assistant tools to government services to building digital health ecosystems for the U.S. health industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The president has also taken a sharper focus on tech — criticizing Tim Cook for Apple’s outsourced supply chain, signing an “anti-woke” AI order, and instructing the attorney general to investigate private companies receiving federal funds that have DEI programs deemed “illegal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and other tech leaders attended the president’s inauguration this year. And, in early September, President Trump threw a tech dinner with 33 top names in Silicon Valley, including Altman, Cook, and Zuckerberg. Musk, a former senior adviser to the president, once known as “First Buddy,” was not present at either dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The banquet seating chart included Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang; Apple CEO Tim Cook; venture capitalist and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks; Alphabet and Google president Ruth Porat; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff; and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, according to the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Thursday, the U.S. and U.K. signed a partnership called the Tech Prosperity Deal to focus on developing nuclear, AI, and quantum technologies. Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and OpenAI also made announcements earlier this week to build data centers in the U.K., while CoreWeave and Salesforce announced a multibillion-pound investment in the country. Overall, American tech firms committed a total of £31 billion ($42 billion) to boost AI infrastructure in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This state banquet guest list seems to have featured more tech and business names than the Hollywood types that often attend such affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent change, and one that AI subscribers may have already seen, is the addition of a Gemini button on the desktop browser. This button opens a popup where you can ask questions about—and get summaries of—content in your open tabs. Android phones already have Gemini operating at the system level to accomplish similar tasks, but Google says the iOS Gemini app will soon be built into Chrome for Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini isn't limited to your current tab. Google aims to make it possible to interact with other apps and tabs without leaving the current screen. When you invoke Gemini in Chrome, it can work with the content in all your open tabs, and it has connections to Google products like Calendar and YouTube. It can also find links in your history based on a vague remembrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI mode is also moving closer to becoming Google's default way to search the web. The updated Chrome now lets you begin AI Mode searches from the omnibar. There's a button to press if you want AI Mode, but it would be quite easy to swap in AI Mode for traditional searches in the browser. The omnibox will also gain "ask about this page" functionality. Chrome can suggest these questions (in English only for now) and show the answer in a side panel. The answer will, naturally, lead off with an AI Overview, and you can ask follow-up questions in AI Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google says it's also using AI to shore up Chrome's security. Gemini tools can already identify common tech support scams. An updated Gemini Nano model will be deployed that expands those detection features to spot fake virus alerts and phony giveaways. Chrome's password manager already tells you about compromised passwords, but with its AI overhaul, it can also automatically change them for you with one click. Although, it seems like that could easily go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An agentic future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the browser's new AI features are things we've seen in testing or early access, and they'll be fully rolled out to Chrome users in the coming weeks. Chrome's next trick will take a bit longer. Later this year, Google says it will add agentic control to Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've seen a few of these "usage agents" over the past year, including OpenAI's Operator and Anthropic's Claude for Chrome. These systems can theoretically control your computer's cursor to complete tasks on your behalf. Google suggests tedious or repetitive things like scheduling a haircut or ordering groceries as a good job for the Chrome agent. Just type your request and watch it go (sort of). Here's a demo from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="1080" id="video-2117914-1" preload="metadata" width="1920"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/InstaCart_example.mp4?_=1" type="video/mp4" /&gt;A demo of Chrome's upcoming usage agent, presumably sped up for the video.&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      A demo of Chrome's upcoming usage agent, presumably sped up for the video.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, usage agents have faced two significant issues: They're slow and expensive. These are generative AI systems, so they won't perform perfectly even as they chew through a mountain of costly tokens. OpenAI Operator is only available for limited use on the $200-per-month subscription, and Anthropic's agent may rack up a few dollars in API charges for completing a simple action like visiting a handful of webpages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't yet know how reliable or fast Google's Chrome agent will be, nor is there any word on additional cost. Google's blog post doesn't even mention restricting this feature to those with subscriptions, but it does have murky limits on many of its AI tools. We've reached out to Google for clarification on this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's agentic browsing assistant may not be any better than what you can get from the competition, but the prevalence of Chrome will get the technology in front of many more people. But will it really be everyone? This company is no stranger to burning money to gain a foothold in AI, but allowing billions of people to tinker with an expensive computer-use model might be a tough sell even for Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An agentic future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the browser's new AI features are things we've seen in testing or early access, and they'll be fully rolled out to Chrome users in the coming weeks. Chrome's next trick will take a bit longer. Later this year, Google says it will add agentic control to Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've seen a few of these "usage agents" over the past year, including OpenAI's Operator and Anthropic's Claude for Chrome. These systems can theoretically control your computer's cursor to complete tasks on your behalf. Google suggests tedious or repetitive things like scheduling a haircut or ordering groceries as a good job for the Chrome agent. Just type your request and watch it go (sort of). Here's a demo from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="1080" id="video-2117914-1" preload="metadata" width="1920"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/InstaCart_example.mp4?_=1" type="video/mp4" /&gt;A demo of Chrome's upcoming usage agent, presumably sped up for the video.&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      A demo of Chrome's upcoming usage agent, presumably sped up for the video.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, usage agents have faced two significant issues: They're slow and expensive. These are generative AI systems, so they won't perform perfectly even as they chew through a mountain of costly tokens. OpenAI Operator is only available for limited use on the $200-per-month subscription, and Anthropic's agent may rack up a few dollars in API charges for completing a simple action like visiting a handful of webpages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't yet know how reliable or fast Google's Chrome agent will be, nor is there any word on additional cost. Google's blog post doesn't even mention restricting this feature to those with subscriptions, but it does have murky limits on many of its AI tools. We've reached out to Google for clarification on this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's agentic browsing assistant may not be any better than what you can get from the competition, but the prevalence of Chrome will get the technology in front of many more people. But will it really be everyone? This company is no stranger to burning money to gain a foothold in AI, but allowing billions of people to tinker with an expensive computer-use model might be a tough sell even for Google.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p&gt;We compared Sensible Agent to a conventional, voice-controlled AR assistant baseline. We measured cognitive load using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), overall usability with the System Usability Scale (SUS), user preference on a 7-point Likert scale, and total interaction time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant finding was the reduction in cognitive workload. The NASA-TLX data showed that on a 100-point scale for mental demand, the average score for Sensible Agent was 21.1, compared to 65.0 for the baseline with a statistically significant difference (&lt;i&gt;𝑝&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .001). We saw a similar significant reduction in perceived effort (&lt;i&gt;𝑝&lt;/i&gt; = .0039), which suggests that the proactive system successfully offloaded the mental work of forming a query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding usability, both systems performed well, with no statistically significant difference between their SUS scores (&lt;i&gt;𝑝&lt;/i&gt; = .11). However, participants expressed a strong and statistically significant preference for Sensible Agent (&lt;i&gt;𝑝&lt;/i&gt; = .0074). On a 7-point scale, the average preference rating was 6.0 for Sensible Agent, compared to 3.8 for the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the interaction time, logged from the moment a prompt was triggered to the final system response to the user's input, the baseline was faster (&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; = 16.4s) compared to Sensible Agent (&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; = 28.5s). This difference is an expected trade-off of the system’s two-step interaction flow, where the agent first proposes an action and the user then confirms it. The strong user preference for Sensible Agent suggests this trade-off was acceptable, particularly in social contexts where discretion and minimal user effort were important.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Both companies have chosen Google Cloud as their primary cloud computing provider, the latest sign of Google’s rising prominence against larger rivals AWS and Microsoft Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deals also highlight Google’s efforts to make its cloud business more central to the company’s future.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, Google Cloud is overshadowed by larger competitors like AWS and Microsoft, as well as Google’s much larger advertising business. But it is seeing upward momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google Cloud is one of the company’s fastest-growing business lines. On its last earnings call, Google said its cloud division hit an annual run rate of $50 billion, and cloud chief Thomas Kurian said this week the unit lined up $58 billion in new revenue over the next two years. Google generated $43.2 billion in cloud services in 2024 and $33.1 billion in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Winning contracts with leading AI startups seems to be a large driver of Google Cloud’s growth. The division says it now works with nine out of the 10 leading AI labs, including Safe Superintelligence and OpenAI, and 60% of the world’s generative AI startups. In the last year, the company says it’s seen a 20% increase in the number of new AI startups choosing Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Lovable and Windsurf, which was recently acquired by Cognition, spend relatively little compared to leading AI labs or large enterprises, the bet is that they will become larger businesses in the future, and well worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google says the two vibe-coding startups use Gemini 2.5 Pro to power their products, which are also run on Google Cloud infrastructure. Google says Windsurf is also using Gemini models in integrations with Cognition’s AI agent, Devin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The significant cloud costs of training, fine-tuning, and running AI models has presented a major challenge for AI model developers, including Google DeepMind with its Gemini models. But it’s been a boon for cloud businesses. The global cloud market is expected to exceed $400 billion in 2025 and grow at a rate of 20% over the next five years, according to the market intelligence and analytics firm Synergy Research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company on Thursday hosted its first Google AI Builder’s Forum, in which it brought together hundreds of AI startup founders and announced more than 40 new AI startups building on Google Cloud. In addition to Lovable and Windsurf, Sequoia-backed Factory AI and Andreessen Horowitz-backed Krea AI were among the customers named.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Part of the reason so many AI startups work with Google Cloud are the generous deals it offers. Many of the AI startups Google works with started on its Google for Startups Cloud Program, in which it offers $350,000 in cloud credits. Google Cloud also offers a dedicated cluster of Nvidia GPUs for startups in the Y Combinator accelerator program. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1709348485.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google Cloud announced Thursday it has added fast-rising AI coding startups Lovable and Windsurf to its roster of customers.

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s visit to the U.K. this week culminated in an NVIDIA AI ecosystem celebration today at Vision Hall in London, where he welcomed U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.K. Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Liz Kendall on stage to discuss the nation’s “Goldilocks moment” where world-class universities, researchers, startups and venture capitalists converge to create a golden network for building out the nation’s AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang also highlighted plans for the U.K.’s AI infrastructure on a panel with Peter Kyle, U.K. Secretary of State for Business and Trade, and Howard Lutnick, U.S. Secretary of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, it’s the world’s third largest AI market — home to 3,700 companies and 60,000 employees, a powerhouse of talent and enterprise — making it an ideal ecosystem for pushing forth the next industrial revolution driven by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the biggest-ever tech agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom,” said Starmer. He highlighted that the U.K’s work with NVIDIA and the U.S. government is focused on using AI for security and safety for both countries, in addition to business and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[AI], which some people find strange and confusing, can open doors,” said Secretary Kendall. “The role of this government is to open doors … and together with [NVIDIA], we can open those doors and give that hope to people in this country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85157"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-85157 size-full" height="680" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/UK-Visit-MAT10573_isp.jpg" width="1280" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-85157"&gt;U.K. Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Liz Kendall with NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t just about London,” Secretary Kyle said, highlighting the collaboration’s reach will span Belfast, Manchester, Edinburgh and other parts of the country. “What you’re seeing is the renewal, the refocus and crucially, the modernizing of the special relationship [between the U.K. and U.S.],” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That modernization taps into AI and digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary Lutnick emphasized the importance of building this infrastructure, highlighting how the U.S. is bringing more energy online to power the AI factories that will make this transformation possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the things we need to do is to build — and that’s part of our philosophy: to build sufficiently at home so that we have the capacity to care for ourselves and the rest of the world if we need to,” Lutnick said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining supercomputing hyperscale facilities and AI investments in Britain will result in incredible scientific exploration and discovery — and crucially, the commercialization of it, Kyle added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe the greatest natural resource of the U.K. is the incredible researchers and scientists,” Huang said. “It is really quite extraordinary. Your universities are creating critical thinkers, independent thinkers, creative thinkers — and they invent amazing things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 500 attendees from startups, venture capital companies, higher education and industry came together at the event to forge connections, exchange ideas and catalyze new growth opportunities at the forefront of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s visit to the U.K. this week culminated in an NVIDIA AI ecosystem celebration today at Vision Hall in London, where he welcomed U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.K. Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Liz Kendall on stage to discuss the nation’s “Goldilocks moment” where world-class universities, researchers, startups and venture capitalists converge to create a golden network for building out the nation’s AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang also highlighted plans for the U.K.’s AI infrastructure on a panel with Peter Kyle, U.K. Secretary of State for Business and Trade, and Howard Lutnick, U.S. Secretary of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85152"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-85152 size-full" height="680" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/UK-Visit-YAR05086_isp.jpg" width="1280" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-85152"&gt;Panel with U.K. Secretary of State for Business and Trade Peter Kyle, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

There was the time Google said its latest quantum chip indicated multiple universes exist. Or when Anthropic gave its AI agent Claudius a snack&amp;nbsp;vending machine to run and it went amok, calling security on people, and insisting it was human. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This week, it was OpenAI’s turn to raise our collective eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released on Monday some research that explained how it’s stopping AI models from “scheming.” It’s a  practice in which an “AI behaves one way on the surface while hiding its true goals,” OpenAI defined in its tweet about the research.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the&amp;nbsp;paper, conducted with Apollo Research, researchers went a bit further, likening AI scheming to a human stock broker breaking the law to make as much money as possible. The researchers, however, argued that most AI “scheming” wasn’t that harmful. “The most common failures involve simple forms of deception — for instance, pretending to have completed a task without actually doing so,” they wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The paper was mostly published to show that “deliberative alignment⁠”&amp;nbsp;— the anti-scheming technique they were testing — worked well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But&amp;nbsp;it also explained that AI developers haven’t figured out a way to train their models not to scheme. That’s because such training could actually teach the model how to scheme even better to avoid being detected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A major failure mode of attempting to ‘train out’ scheming is simply teaching the model to scheme more carefully and covertly,” the researchers wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perhaps the most astonishing part is that, if a model understands that it’s&amp;nbsp;being tested, it can pretend it’s not scheming just to pass the test, even if it is still scheming. “Models often become more aware that they are being evaluated. This situational awareness can itself reduce scheming, independent of genuine alignment,” the researchers wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not news that AI models will lie. By now most of us have experienced AI hallucinations, or the model confidently giving an answer to a prompt that simply isn’t true. But hallucinations are basically presenting guesswork with confidence, as OpenAI research released earlier this month documented.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Scheming is something else. It’s deliberate. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even this revelation — that a model will deliberately mislead humans — isn’t new.&amp;nbsp;Apollo Research first published a paper in December documenting how five models schemed when they were given instructions to achieve a goal&amp;nbsp;“at all costs.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The news here is actually good news: the researchers saw significant reductions in scheming by using “deliberative alignment⁠.” That technique involves teaching the model an “anti-scheming specification” and then making the model go review it before acting. It’s a little like making little kids repeat the rules&amp;nbsp;before allowing them to play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI researchers insist that the lying they’ve caught with their own models, or even with ChatGPT, isn’t that serious. As OpenAI’s co-founder Wojciech Zaremba told TechCrunch’s Maxwell Zeff about this research: “This work has been done in the simulated environments, and we think it represents future use cases. However,&amp;nbsp;today, we haven’t seen this kind of consequential scheming in our production traffic. Nonetheless, it is well known that there are forms of deception in ChatGPT. You might ask it to implement some website, and it might tell you, ‘Yes, I did a great job.” And that’s just the lie. There are some petty forms of deception that we still need to address.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The fact that AI models from multiple players intentionally deceive humans is, perhaps, understandable. They were built by humans, to mimic humans and (synthetic data aside) for the most part trained on data produced by humans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s also bonkers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While we’ve all experienced the frustration of poorly performing technology (thinking of you, home printers of yesteryear), when was the last time your not-AI software deliberately lied to you? Has your inbox ever fabricated&amp;nbsp;emails on its own? Has your CMS logged new prospects that didn’t exist to pad its numbers? Has your fintech app made up its own bank transactions?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s worth pondering this as the corporate world barrels towards an AI future where companies believe agents can be treated like independent employees. The researchers of this paper have the same warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As AIs are assigned more complex tasks with real-world consequences and begin pursuing more ambiguous, long-term goals, we expect that the potential for harmful scheming will grow — so our safeguards and our ability to rigorously test must grow correspondingly,” they wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-484036335.jpg?resize=1200,912" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Every now and then, researchers at the biggest tech companies drop a bombshell.
