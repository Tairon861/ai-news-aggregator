&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;U.K.-based Cavalry works on 2D motion animation for different verticals such as advertising, marketing, gaming, and generative art. Canva said that Cavalry’s tooling will add to the existing capabilities of Affinity, Canva’s professional creative editing suite for photos, vectors, and layouts, which it acquired in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Canva revamped Affinity’s design last year and made it free for all users. The company said that since then, people have downloaded the software over 5 million times. Affinity has the capabilities of photos, vector, and layout editing. With this acquisition, Canva wants to add motion editing to its suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“By bringing Cavalry alongside&amp;nbsp;Affinity, we’re closing that [motion editing] gap and unlocking a complete professional suite spanning photo, vector, layout, and now motion editing,” the company said in a blog post. “Together, these tools form the foundation of a full-stack Creative OS for professional work, while preserving the depth and control professional creatives rely on,” it added. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Besides Cavalry, Canva has also acquired stealth startup MangoAI, which was working on building reinforcement learning systems to improve video ad performance, according to its website. Canva said that the startup’s first product helped clients create and launch ads and observe outcomes to improve future campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MangoAI was built by Nirmal Govind, former Vice President of Data Science &amp;amp; Engineering at Netflix, and Vinith Misra, a former data scientist at Netflix and Roblox. Canva said that Govind will become Canva’s first “chief algorithms officer” and Misra will work on improving Canva’s marketing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In January 2025, Canva acquired marketing intelligence startup MagicBrief and later last year, it launched a growth tool called Canva Grow for asset creation and performance measurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During a sit-down at Web Summit Qatar earlier this month, Canva co-founder and COO Cliff Obrecht told TechCrunch that Canva Grow is doing “incredibly well,” especially when it comes to creating static content and publishing it to Meta platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It is quite an early product, but we’ll soon be launching a lot more things around video creation, deploying across multi-platform,” Obrecht said. “So it’s very early, but it’s very much got a very loyal small user base, but a lot of big brands are spending money, and then we’re scaling up massively.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the new acquisitions, the company wants to bolster its position as a marketing solution by potentially adding video creation and more granular measurement. Canva closed 2025 at $4 billion in annualized revenue with more than 265 million users and 31 million paid users.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Monday, creative suite maker Canva announced the dual acquisition of startups Cavalry, which works on animation, and MangoAI, which works on improving ad performance.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, AI is finally making that problem solvable – and the market has responded with a reality check for one of technology’s oldest names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares recorded their worst single-day drop in more than 25 years earlier this week, plunging 13% after AI startup Anthropic said its Claude Code tool can accelerate COBOL modernisation – the kind of painstaking, expensive legacy work that has underpinned a portion of IBM’s consulting revenue for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Anthropic blog stated that “modernising a COBOL system once required armies of consultants spending years mapping workflows,” and argued that tools like Claude Code can now automate the exploration and analysis phases that consume most of the effort in COBOL modernisation. That single claim was enough to send investors reaching for the sell button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;COBOL is bigger than most realise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why the reaction was so sharp, it helps to understand just how entrenched COBOL remains. Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL code run in production daily, powering critical systems in finance and government sectors. The language handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deeper problem isn’t the code itself – it’s the people who understand it. The number of developers who understand COBOL continues to shrink as the workforce that built these systems has largely retired. That talent scarcity is precisely what made COBOL modernisation so expensive for so long, and what made large consulting engagements – the kind IBM and rivals like Accenture and Cognizant built profitable practices around – essentially unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic argues that AI flips this equation entirely. Claude Code works by mapping dependencies in thousands of lines of code, documenting workflows, identifying risks faster than human analysts, and providing teams with deep insights for informed decision-making. The company says teams can now modernise COBOL codebases in quarters not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;IBM was already here&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the market’s reaction may be overlooking is that IBM itself has been making this argument for some time. Anthropic’s post comes about three years after IBM itself suggested using AI to rewrite COBOL as Java and created a product called “watsonx Code Assistant for Z” to do it. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said as recently as July 2025 that the company’s AI coding assistant for mainframes “has got very adoption,” with the majority of customers using it to understand their COBOL codebase and decide what to modernise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM defended its position on Monday, saying its mainframe platform delivers the same quality of performance and security regardless of programming language – COBOL or otherwise. And analysts were quick to add nuance to the panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani noted that “clients already had the option to migrate from the mainframe, yet they are sticking with the platform,” suggesting the fear of displacement may be outrunning the reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The broader pattern&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM wasn’t alone in taking a hit. Accenture and Cognizant also declined following the news – a sign that investors are looking at the entire consulting model around legacy modernisation, not IBM’s mainframe hardware business. Just last week, cybersecurity stocks sold off sharply after Anthropic announced Claude Code Security, a tool that scans codebases for vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern is becoming familiar: each new AI ability announcement triggers a reassessment of which existing revenue streams might be compressed, and the market prices in fear immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM didn’t stay quiet. Rob Thomas, the company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, pushed back directly in the aforementioned blog post, drawing a line the market appeared to have missed: “Translating code is one thing. Modernising a platform is something else entirely. The two are not the same, and the gap between them is where most enterprises run into trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His argument is worth sitting with. The value IBM’s mainframe delivers, Thomas contends, has nothing to do with COBOL as a language – it lives in the vertically integrated stack underneath it: z/OS, transaction processing architecture, quantum-safe encryption, and decades of hardware-software optimisation that no code translation tool touches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s Claude Code, in his reading, is solving a real problem – just not the one that matters most for enterprises running IBM Z. He also raised a point that complicates the headline narrative further: roughly 40% of COBOL actually runs on Windows, Linux, and other distributed platforms – not mainframes at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of what’s being framed as an IBM mainframe story is partly a distributed systems problem that has been folded into a mainframe headline. IBM’s own clients are already making the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Canada has used IBM’s watsonx Code Assistant for Z to map dependencies and build modernisation blueprints for core applications. The National Organisation for Social Insurance reported a 94% reduction in time to analyse legacy COBOL code using the same tool – cutting an eight-hour task to roughly 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Monday’s selloff was a fair verdict or a reflexive one, the underlying change is real: AI is making COBOL modernisation economically viable for the first time in decades. The question IBM is asking – and the market hasn’t fully answered – is whether that’s a threat to its business or an acceleration of the transformation it’s already leading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hitachi bets on industrial expertise to win the physical AI race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This illegal activity is incredibly hard to disrupt, since it’s backed by sophisticated criminal networks and the perpetrators know that their chances of being caught are slim. With an annual value of $20 billion, according to Interpol, it’s the world’s fourth-most-lucrative criminal enterprise after trafficking in drugs, weapons, and people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The United Nations seeks to end trafficking in protected species by 2030. But the environmental guardians facing up to these nefarious networks—dispersed alliances of rangers, community groups, and law enforcement officers—have long been ill equipped and underfunded. A recent report by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime found “no reason for confidence” that the 2030 target would be reached.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, there is genuine hope that tech could help turn the tide. Tools initially developed for cities and research facilities are increasingly moving into the planet’s wild places, allowing environmental agencies and self-motivated communities in both richer and poorer countries to step up their efforts to detect illegal goods, trace smuggling networks, and prevent poaching at the source.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In December, Interpol announced it had seized record numbers of live animals, thanks in part to a set of sophisticated tools that had helped to expose hidden networks behind trafficking. Its Operation Thunder 2025 coordinated law enforcement agencies from 134 countries and seized 30,000 live animals, from apes to butterflies, using a suite of technologies including digital forensics and AI-driven detection. “The success of Thunder 2025 shows that modern threats demand modern tools,” says José Adrián Sanchez Romero, an operations coordinator at Interpol’s environmental security subdirectorate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are five examples of technologies that are arming conservationists and others in the battle to end wildlife crime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Researcher marks the horn of a subdued rhino on the ground" class="wp-image-1133246" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Rhisotope-Project-2025-4-edited.jpg" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE RHISOTOPE PROJECT&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tagging rhinos&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In July, a group of South African researchers announced they had won government approval for one of the most eyebrow-raising attempts to prevent wildlife crime: drilling radioactive substances into the horns of rhinoceroses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In an effort dubbed the Rhisotope Project, the group worked in 2024 and 2025 to fit 33 rhinos from Limpopo Rhino Orphanage in South Africa with pellets containing low-level radioactive isotopes. The project is supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Blood samples and veterinary exams have shown that the pellets don’t affect the health of the rhinos, the rangers, or the surrounding environment. But the isotope emits enough radiation for the horns to be detected by radiation portal monitors, devices that can scan cargo containers and vehicles to detect illicit sources of radiation. Eleven thousand such monitors are already in operation at airports and shipping terminals worldwide, in addition to thousands of personal monitors worn by border security. In November 2024,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Rhisotope tested the system at New York airports and harbors in collaboration with the US Customs and Border Patrol. The group found that border guards could detect an individual horn the team had planted inside a full 40-foot shipping container.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The project was pioneered by James Larkin, director of the radiation and health physics unit at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. Though the country is currently home to 15,000 rhinos, the majority of Africa’s total population, poachers have killed 10,000 rhinos there since 2007. In the past, the common approach to deterring poachers was to eliminate the part they’re seeking, preemptively cutting off the animal’s entire horn. But dehorning requires rhinos to be sedated for long periods, and it’s a stressful and costly process that must be repeated every 18 to 24 months, as rhino horns grow back. The act also renders rhinos less able to protect themselves, and they tend to withdraw from social interactions and competition for mates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new approach is far less painful and time-consuming. Each dose costs 21,500 South African rand (about $1,300) per animal and remains active for five years. Warning signs along perimeter fences make it clear the animals have been tagged, helping to deter poachers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Larkin, who spent his career as a nuclear safety expert, says he was initially wary when conservationists suggested to him that radioactive substances could help prevent rhino poaching, joking that he didn’t want to end up in jail if anyone got hurt. But he changed his mind when he realized there was a dose that would be harmless to bystanders while making the horns both worthless to smugglers and readily detectable. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Poachers will kill a rhino for even a small amount of horn, which can fetch $60,000 per kilogram as an ingredient for traditional medicines. Adding isotopes, though, renders the horns potentially unsafe to consume, and it’s hard for smugglers to reverse: “It’s almost impossible to remove isotopes unless you are a skilled radiation protection officer who knows what they are looking for,” Larkin says. Even so, he’s tight-lipped about the compound the pellets are made from and what they look like: “I don’t want to help criminals,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The South African health agency has now approved Rhisotope to roll out the program across the country. “We have a goal ultimately to treat up to 500 rhinos a year,” says Jessica Babich, chief executive of the project. At the same time, the group is working to adapt its approach to other popular poaching targets—elephant tusks and pangolin scales—as well as trafficked plants like cycads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A handheld portable scanner on the flank of a lizard" class="wp-image-1133239" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/XRF_device.jpg?w=1392" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF TARONGA CONSERVATION SOCIETY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="scan of a lizard" class="wp-image-1133234" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Rapiscan_8.jpg?w=1029" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF TARONGA CONSERVATION SOCIETY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scanning signatures&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many exotic pets, from birds to pythons, there are two parallel trades: a legal one in farmed or captive-bred animals and an illicit one in creatures taken from the wild. But faced with a lizard or a parrot, how can law enforcement know its origin story?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Australia, some conservationists have been trying to follow the numbers. It’s very hard to breed the egg-­laying mammals known as short-beaked echidnas. US zoos have yielded only 19 echidna babies, or “puggles,” in a century of efforts. So Indonesia’s yearly export of dozens of “captive-bred” echidnas has long raised suspicions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address the issue, a team at Australia’s Taronga Conservation Society, led by Kate Brandis, has developed an x-ray fluorescence (XRF) gun that can analyze elemental signatures in keratin—the stuff of quills, feathers, and hair. Wild echidnas, for instance, forage for a diverse diet of beetle larvae, ants, and grubs, while captive animals tend to be raised on a low-diversity diet of commercial feed. Each of these dietary histories leaves a record in the mammals’ porcupine-like spines, which can be read with high accuracy using a handheld XRF gun. Similar evidence can be found in other species, like cockatoos, pangolins, and turtles, which the team has used to test the device.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is certainly plenty more to be done: Australia, home to many unique species that live nowhere else on the planet, is a target for collectors from Asia, Europe, and the US. Brandis is targeting some of the species most often trafficked out of the country, including shingleback and blue-tongue lizards. Not long ago, Australian environmental authorities led a trial study at post offices across the country, using the XRF gun alongside AI-equipped parcel scanners, which Brandis’s team had trained to recognize concealed species in real time. The trial uncovered more than 100 legally protected lizards that were being shipped out of Australia; a distributor was sentenced to more than three years in jail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="serviceman at a control center looks at the Skylight AI app on a large wall display" class="wp-image-1133230" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/E08C5A59-E3D0-4552-BED9-C68B7CAAB8A4_1_105_c.jpg?w=718" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF SKYLIGHT AI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="person holds a phone with the app while looking at a nearby vessel at sea" class="wp-image-1133233" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Marine-Training-Program-11.jpg?w=1378" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF SKYLIGHT AI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AI in the sky&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Commercial fishing, scuba diving, and oil exploration are all prohibited in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument near Hawaii, an expanse of the Pacific larger than all US national parks combined. It is just one of a number of vast marine protected areas that have emerged in recent years, along with global pacts to conserve 30% of Earth’s land and sea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But establishing these reserves is just one step. Enforcing their protection is another matter. And for many marine reserves—especially those in the Global South—there is no real way to do that, says Ted Schmitt, senior director of conservation at the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI (AI2). Thousands of square kilometers of open ocean is a lot to monitor. Even with satellites scanning the marine areas, the reality until recently was that you had to know what you were looking for: “When you have the vastness of the ocean, you can have analysts who are very well trained, looking for vessels,” he says. Even then, there is little chance of finding wrongdoing without intelligence from the ground.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2017, Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen began developing a tool called Skylight to provide analysts with more of that intelligence, using AI to help analyze satellite and ship-tracking data to detect suspicious behavior. The project moved to AI2 after Allen’s death in 2018, and the technology has since been adopted by more than 200 organizations in more than 70 countries. “We’re basically monitoring the entire ocean 24-7-365, and surfacing all these vessels,” says Schmitt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To see how coast guards use the system, Schmitt points to a series of arrests in Panama in early 2025. That January, satellites found 16 boats about 200 kilometers off the coast inside the Coiba Ridge marine reserve, which serves as a migratory highway for sharks, rays, and large fish like yellowfin tuna. Skylight’s AI algorithms, trained to recognize the signature movements of various types of fishing, detected long-line fishing and requested higher-resolution images of the site from a commercial satellite flying overhead. The images and Skylight’s analysis were used by Panama’s environmental agency and military, which deployed ships and aircraft to the area, ultimately seizing six vessels and thousands of kilograms of illegally taken fish.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skylight AI detects around 300,000 vessels per week, according to the company’s platform analytics. Stories like Coiba Ridge make clear that AI can benefit partners who are working tirelessly on the ground, says Schmitt: “The Panama case really was one of those ‘wow’ moments, not because the technology finally proved itself, but because the agencies that needed to operationalize it, and actually take it to a legal finish, did it.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="closeup on the gloved hands of a man outside with a DNA test kit" class="wp-image-1133232" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8831.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF WILDTECHDNA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rapid DNA tests&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the conservation scientist Natalie Schmitt was researching snow leopards in remote areas of Nepal, she worked with people who could point out signs of these elusive big cats—often a pile of droppings. But the results weren’t reliable: Leopard scat can easily be confused with the poop of wolves and foxes, which share the same habitat and prey, she explains. What Schmitt wanted was a tool that could identify the animal involved, right on the spot—ideally by finding a way to sequence the DNA in the scat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While some laboratories can take DNA samples of such material and identify species of interest, they are few and far between in rich countries and usually nonexistent in poorer countries, meaning that this process can be weeks long and involve shipping samples cross-country or across borders. This is a problem not just for field research but for wildlife trafficking enforcement. Imagine a border agent who has just opened a box of shark-like fins or a shipment of live parrots and needs to know whether the particular species is one that can legally be captured and transported. People in this situation don’t have weeks to spare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Schmitt founded WildTechDNA, which has developed a DNA test that aims to do that work on the fly. The test, which is about as easy and fast as a home pregnancy test, employs a simple two-step process. First, a new extraction method—“Literally, put the sample in the extraction tube and squeeze 10 times,” she says—can cut the time it takes to pull DNA out of a sample from a day to about three minutes. Then, to actually test that DNA, the company took inspiration from the covid pandemic. The researchers found they could use technology similar to rapid at-home tests to identify whether the DNA in question belongs to a specific species: “Our tests use very simple lateral-flow strips to tell you whether a sample belongs to your target species of interest, yes or no.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The strips can be tailored to test for a wide range of targets, from big cats to microbes, opening up diverse applications in the wild. They can tell if samples of hair belong to a snow leopard, or if a frog has been infected with the fungi that cause chytridiomycosis, a disease that has devastated amphibians worldwide and wiped out at least 90 species.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;WildTechDNA’s earliest adopter was the Canadian government, which wanted to detect European eels—a critically endangered species that is effectively impossible to identify by appearance. This confusion has allowed €3 billion of European eels to be smuggled each year, disguised as other eel species. Some of that passes into Canada on its way to suppliers in Japan and China, and in some cases on to Canadian restaurants and consumers. “When a shipment is suspected to contain European eel, they’ll randomly sample it and they’ll send those samples off to a lab across the country, which will take three weeks,” says Schmitt of traditional tracking methods. WildTechDNA developed tests specific to European eels and taught Canadian enforcement officers how to use them, so that they could launch a “nationwide European eel blitz,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a 2025 campaign, European eels turned up in fewer than 1% of shipments. Schmitt says Canadian authorities have not disclosed details about investigations but are encouraged by the results—significantly below the rates detected using older technologies in 2016, an improvement they attribute to better surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to affordable camera traps and animal-mounted GPS tags, low-cost solar-powered microphones have proved to be strikingly effective at revealing what’s living in some of the planet’s most densely inhabited and biodiverse environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rainforest Connection, a nonprofit founded by the physicist turned conservation-­tech entrepreneur Topher White in 2014, was a pioneer in bioacoustic monitoring for conservation. The group initially repurposed old phones into low-cost monitoring devices but has since developed a standardized device called the Guardian that has now been deployed in more than 600 locations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Guardians are designed to capture a broad soundscape of the rainforest: “They sit out in the rainforest for long periods of time, up in treetops. They’re solar-powered, they can last for years, and we listen to all the sounds continuously and transmit that up to the cloud, where we are then able to analyze it for all sorts of things,” says White. From the outset, the aim was to use these devices to pick up immediate threats—“chainsaws, logging trucks, gunshots, things like that,” White says—and relay real-time alerts to local partners, including police, Indigenous groups, and local communities that protect the land.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133238" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Setting-up-a-Guardian_5.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAINFOREST CONNECTION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Guardian device in a tree canopy" class="wp-image-1133229" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DJI_0018.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAINFOREST CONNECTION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bioacoustic monitoring devices have rapidly advanced in recent years. Many can now analyze data before transmitting it, and they’ve become cheaper to make as batteries have gotten smaller. By today’s standards, Rainforest Connection’s sensors are “over-engineered,” says White. But having a large number of detectors already deployed means there is ample data that can be mined for signals beyond well-known red flags, like gunshots. “An area for a lot more innovation going forward is to use the soundscape itself as a detector,” White says. Rainforest Connection and the German software firm SAP tested this approach on the island of Sumatra and found they could identify human intruders by using machine learning to hunt for “uncharacteristic sudden changes to the soundscape.” For example, tracking animal calls—and noting when those animals go silent—could reveal the arrival of poachers. In 2026, Rainforest Connection will roll out this approach to reserves in Thailand, Jamaica, and Romania by building a unique model for each environment, trained on thousands of hours of audio and verified using camera traps. “We have a lot of eyes and ears in the forest already, all of which are aware and reacting to each other and to new stimuli,” White says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, Rainforest Connection’s unfiltered stream has another use: an app where you can listen to the livestream from the Ecuadorian rainforest, taking in the complete soundscape of birdsong, frog chatter, and cicada chirps.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew Ponsford is a freelance reporter based in London.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every year, poachers shoot hundreds of rhinos, fishing crews haul millions of sharks out of protected seas, and smugglers carry countless animals and plants across borders. This illegal activity is incredibly hard to disrupt, since it’s backed by sophisticated criminal networks and the perpetrators know that their chances of being caught are slim. With an annual value of $20 billion, according to Interpol, it’s the world’s fourth-most-lucrative criminal enterprise after trafficking in drugs, weapons, and people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The United Nations seeks to end trafficking in protected species by 2030. But the environmental guardians facing up to these nefarious networks—dispersed alliances of rangers, community groups, and law enforcement officers—have long been ill equipped and underfunded. A recent report by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime found “no reason for confidence” that the 2030 target would be reached.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, there is genuine hope that tech could help turn the tide. Tools initially developed for cities and research facilities are increasingly moving into the planet’s wild places, allowing environmental agencies and self-motivated communities in both richer and poorer countries to step up their efforts to detect illegal goods, trace smuggling networks, and prevent poaching at the source.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In December, Interpol announced it had seized record numbers of live animals, thanks in part to a set of sophisticated tools that had helped to expose hidden networks behind trafficking. Its Operation Thunder 2025 coordinated law enforcement agencies from 134 countries and seized 30,000 live animals, from apes to butterflies, using a suite of technologies including digital forensics and AI-driven detection. “The success of Thunder 2025 shows that modern threats demand modern tools,” says José Adrián Sanchez Romero, an operations coordinator at Interpol’s environmental security subdirectorate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are five examples of technologies that are arming conservationists and others in the battle to end wildlife crime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Researcher marks the horn of a subdued rhino on the ground" class="wp-image-1133246" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Rhisotope-Project-2025-4-edited.jpg" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE RHISOTOPE PROJECT&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tagging rhinos&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In July, a group of South African researchers announced they had won government approval for one of the most eyebrow-raising attempts to prevent wildlife crime: drilling radioactive substances into the horns of rhinoceroses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In an effort dubbed the Rhisotope Project, the group worked in 2024 and 2025 to fit 33 rhinos from Limpopo Rhino Orphanage in South Africa with pellets containing low-level radioactive isotopes. The project is supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Blood samples and veterinary exams have shown that the pellets don’t affect the health of the rhinos, the rangers, or the surrounding environment. But the isotope emits enough radiation for the horns to be detected by radiation portal monitors, devices that can scan cargo containers and vehicles to detect illicit sources of radiation. Eleven thousand such monitors are already in operation at airports and shipping terminals worldwide, in addition to thousands of personal monitors worn by border security. In November 2024,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Rhisotope tested the system at New York airports and harbors in collaboration with the US Customs and Border Patrol. The group found that border guards could detect an individual horn the team had planted inside a full 40-foot shipping container.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The project was pioneered by James Larkin, director of the radiation and health physics unit at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. Though the country is currently home to 15,000 rhinos, the majority of Africa’s total population, poachers have killed 10,000 rhinos there since 2007. In the past, the common approach to deterring poachers was to eliminate the part they’re seeking, preemptively cutting off the animal’s entire horn. But dehorning requires rhinos to be sedated for long periods, and it’s a stressful and costly process that must be repeated every 18 to 24 months, as rhino horns grow back. The act also renders rhinos less able to protect themselves, and they tend to withdraw from social interactions and competition for mates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new approach is far less painful and time-consuming. Each dose costs 21,500 South African rand (about $1,300) per animal and remains active for five years. Warning signs along perimeter fences make it clear the animals have been tagged, helping to deter poachers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Larkin, who spent his career as a nuclear safety expert, says he was initially wary when conservationists suggested to him that radioactive substances could help prevent rhino poaching, joking that he didn’t want to end up in jail if anyone got hurt. But he changed his mind when he realized there was a dose that would be harmless to bystanders while making the horns both worthless to smugglers and readily detectable. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Poachers will kill a rhino for even a small amount of horn, which can fetch $60,000 per kilogram as an ingredient for traditional medicines. Adding isotopes, though, renders the horns potentially unsafe to consume, and it’s hard for smugglers to reverse: “It’s almost impossible to remove isotopes unless you are a skilled radiation protection officer who knows what they are looking for,” Larkin says. Even so, he’s tight-lipped about the compound the pellets are made from and what they look like: “I don’t want to help criminals,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The South African health agency has now approved Rhisotope to roll out the program across the country. “We have a goal ultimately to treat up to 500 rhinos a year,” says Jessica Babich, chief executive of the project. At the same time, the group is working to adapt its approach to other popular poaching targets—elephant tusks and pangolin scales—as well as trafficked plants like cycads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A handheld portable scanner on the flank of a lizard" class="wp-image-1133239" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/XRF_device.jpg?w=1392" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF TARONGA CONSERVATION SOCIETY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="scan of a lizard" class="wp-image-1133234" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Rapiscan_8.jpg?w=1029" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF TARONGA CONSERVATION SOCIETY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scanning signatures&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many exotic pets, from birds to pythons, there are two parallel trades: a legal one in farmed or captive-bred animals and an illicit one in creatures taken from the wild. But faced with a lizard or a parrot, how can law enforcement know its origin story?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Australia, some conservationists have been trying to follow the numbers. It’s very hard to breed the egg-­laying mammals known as short-beaked echidnas. US zoos have yielded only 19 echidna babies, or “puggles,” in a century of efforts. So Indonesia’s yearly export of dozens of “captive-bred” echidnas has long raised suspicions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address the issue, a team at Australia’s Taronga Conservation Society, led by Kate Brandis, has developed an x-ray fluorescence (XRF) gun that can analyze elemental signatures in keratin—the stuff of quills, feathers, and hair. Wild echidnas, for instance, forage for a diverse diet of beetle larvae, ants, and grubs, while captive animals tend to be raised on a low-diversity diet of commercial feed. Each of these dietary histories leaves a record in the mammals’ porcupine-like spines, which can be read with high accuracy using a handheld XRF gun. Similar evidence can be found in other species, like cockatoos, pangolins, and turtles, which the team has used to test the device.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is certainly plenty more to be done: Australia, home to many unique species that live nowhere else on the planet, is a target for collectors from Asia, Europe, and the US. Brandis is targeting some of the species most often trafficked out of the country, including shingleback and blue-tongue lizards. Not long ago, Australian environmental authorities led a trial study at post offices across the country, using the XRF gun alongside AI-equipped parcel scanners, which Brandis’s team had trained to recognize concealed species in real time. The trial uncovered more than 100 legally protected lizards that were being shipped out of Australia; a distributor was sentenced to more than three years in jail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="serviceman at a control center looks at the Skylight AI app on a large wall display" class="wp-image-1133230" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/E08C5A59-E3D0-4552-BED9-C68B7CAAB8A4_1_105_c.jpg?w=718" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF SKYLIGHT AI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="person holds a phone with the app while looking at a nearby vessel at sea" class="wp-image-1133233" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Marine-Training-Program-11.jpg?w=1378" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF SKYLIGHT AI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AI in the sky&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Commercial fishing, scuba diving, and oil exploration are all prohibited in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument near Hawaii, an expanse of the Pacific larger than all US national parks combined. It is just one of a number of vast marine protected areas that have emerged in recent years, along with global pacts to conserve 30% of Earth’s land and sea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But establishing these reserves is just one step. Enforcing their protection is another matter. And for many marine reserves—especially those in the Global South—there is no real way to do that, says Ted Schmitt, senior director of conservation at the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI (AI2). Thousands of square kilometers of open ocean is a lot to monitor. Even with satellites scanning the marine areas, the reality until recently was that you had to know what you were looking for: “When you have the vastness of the ocean, you can have analysts who are very well trained, looking for vessels,” he says. Even then, there is little chance of finding wrongdoing without intelligence from the ground.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2017, Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen began developing a tool called Skylight to provide analysts with more of that intelligence, using AI to help analyze satellite and ship-tracking data to detect suspicious behavior. The project moved to AI2 after Allen’s death in 2018, and the technology has since been adopted by more than 200 organizations in more than 70 countries. “We’re basically monitoring the entire ocean 24-7-365, and surfacing all these vessels,” says Schmitt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To see how coast guards use the system, Schmitt points to a series of arrests in Panama in early 2025. That January, satellites found 16 boats about 200 kilometers off the coast inside the Coiba Ridge marine reserve, which serves as a migratory highway for sharks, rays, and large fish like yellowfin tuna. Skylight’s AI algorithms, trained to recognize the signature movements of various types of fishing, detected long-line fishing and requested higher-resolution images of the site from a commercial satellite flying overhead. The images and Skylight’s analysis were used by Panama’s environmental agency and military, which deployed ships and aircraft to the area, ultimately seizing six vessels and thousands of kilograms of illegally taken fish.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skylight AI detects around 300,000 vessels per week, according to the company’s platform analytics. Stories like Coiba Ridge make clear that AI can benefit partners who are working tirelessly on the ground, says Schmitt: “The Panama case really was one of those ‘wow’ moments, not because the technology finally proved itself, but because the agencies that needed to operationalize it, and actually take it to a legal finish, did it.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="closeup on the gloved hands of a man outside with a DNA test kit" class="wp-image-1133232" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8831.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF WILDTECHDNA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rapid DNA tests&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the conservation scientist Natalie Schmitt was researching snow leopards in remote areas of Nepal, she worked with people who could point out signs of these elusive big cats—often a pile of droppings. But the results weren’t reliable: Leopard scat can easily be confused with the poop of wolves and foxes, which share the same habitat and prey, she explains. What Schmitt wanted was a tool that could identify the animal involved, right on the spot—ideally by finding a way to sequence the DNA in the scat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While some laboratories can take DNA samples of such material and identify species of interest, they are few and far between in rich countries and usually nonexistent in poorer countries, meaning that this process can be weeks long and involve shipping samples cross-country or across borders. This is a problem not just for field research but for wildlife trafficking enforcement. Imagine a border agent who has just opened a box of shark-like fins or a shipment of live parrots and needs to know whether the particular species is one that can legally be captured and transported. People in this situation don’t have weeks to spare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Schmitt founded WildTechDNA, which has developed a DNA test that aims to do that work on the fly. The test, which is about as easy and fast as a home pregnancy test, employs a simple two-step process. First, a new extraction method—“Literally, put the sample in the extraction tube and squeeze 10 times,” she says—can cut the time it takes to pull DNA out of a sample from a day to about three minutes. Then, to actually test that DNA, the company took inspiration from the covid pandemic. The researchers found they could use technology similar to rapid at-home tests to identify whether the DNA in question belongs to a specific species: “Our tests use very simple lateral-flow strips to tell you whether a sample belongs to your target species of interest, yes or no.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The strips can be tailored to test for a wide range of targets, from big cats to microbes, opening up diverse applications in the wild. They can tell if samples of hair belong to a snow leopard, or if a frog has been infected with the fungi that cause chytridiomycosis, a disease that has devastated amphibians worldwide and wiped out at least 90 species.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;WildTechDNA’s earliest adopter was the Canadian government, which wanted to detect European eels—a critically endangered species that is effectively impossible to identify by appearance. This confusion has allowed €3 billion of European eels to be smuggled each year, disguised as other eel species. Some of that passes into Canada on its way to suppliers in Japan and China, and in some cases on to Canadian restaurants and consumers. “When a shipment is suspected to contain European eel, they’ll randomly sample it and they’ll send those samples off to a lab across the country, which will take three weeks,” says Schmitt of traditional tracking methods. WildTechDNA developed tests specific to European eels and taught Canadian enforcement officers how to use them, so that they could launch a “nationwide European eel blitz,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a 2025 campaign, European eels turned up in fewer than 1% of shipments. Schmitt says Canadian authorities have not disclosed details about investigations but are encouraged by the results—significantly below the rates detected using older technologies in 2016, an improvement they attribute to better surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to affordable camera traps and animal-mounted GPS tags, low-cost solar-powered microphones have proved to be strikingly effective at revealing what’s living in some of the planet’s most densely inhabited and biodiverse environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rainforest Connection, a nonprofit founded by the physicist turned conservation-­tech entrepreneur Topher White in 2014, was a pioneer in bioacoustic monitoring for conservation. The group initially repurposed old phones into low-cost monitoring devices but has since developed a standardized device called the Guardian that has now been deployed in more than 600 locations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Guardians are designed to capture a broad soundscape of the rainforest: “They sit out in the rainforest for long periods of time, up in treetops. They’re solar-powered, they can last for years, and we listen to all the sounds continuously and transmit that up to the cloud, where we are then able to analyze it for all sorts of things,” says White. From the outset, the aim was to use these devices to pick up immediate threats—“chainsaws, logging trucks, gunshots, things like that,” White says—and relay real-time alerts to local partners, including police, Indigenous groups, and local communities that protect the land.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133238" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Setting-up-a-Guardian_5.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAINFOREST CONNECTION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Guardian device in a tree canopy" class="wp-image-1133229" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DJI_0018.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAINFOREST CONNECTION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bioacoustic monitoring devices have rapidly advanced in recent years. Many can now analyze data before transmitting it, and they’ve become cheaper to make as batteries have gotten smaller. By today’s standards, Rainforest Connection’s sensors are “over-engineered,” says White. But having a large number of detectors already deployed means there is ample data that can be mined for signals beyond well-known red flags, like gunshots. “An area for a lot more innovation going forward is to use the soundscape itself as a detector,” White says. Rainforest Connection and the German software firm SAP tested this approach on the island of Sumatra and found they could identify human intruders by using machine learning to hunt for “uncharacteristic sudden changes to the soundscape.” For example, tracking animal calls—and noting when those animals go silent—could reveal the arrival of poachers. In 2026, Rainforest Connection will roll out this approach to reserves in Thailand, Jamaica, and Romania by building a unique model for each environment, trained on thousands of hours of audio and verified using camera traps. “We have a lot of eyes and ears in the forest already, all of which are aware and reacting to each other and to new stimuli,” White says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, Rainforest Connection’s unfiltered stream has another use: an app where you can listen to the livestream from the Ecuadorian rainforest, taking in the complete soundscape of birdsong, frog chatter, and cicada chirps.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew Ponsford is a freelance reporter based in London.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/24/1132760/conservationists-making-rhinos-radioactive/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>We’re putting more stuff into space than ever.

Jesper Persson from the company said there had been benefits. “Since day one, we’ve perceived the desired values from the project. The quality of invoices has improved considerably, and the AI continues to evolve and improve with each passing day. The efficiency gains we achieved translated directly into tangible cost savings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company’s objective is to have finance teams delegate decisions and actions to agents in the future, and it plans to release more AI tools in 2026. The company states that AI is in its platform not an add-on feature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/invoicing-agentic-ai-baswares-ai-agents-from-invoicing-to-100-automated/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 12:14:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Nimble raises $47M to give AI agents access to real-time web data (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/nimble-way-raises-47m-to-give-ai-agents-better-cleaner-data/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nimble-Cofounders-with-Norwest-Investor.png?resize=1200,857" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Believe it or not, web search is still thriving as an industry. As businesses invest in using AI agents to make the most of their data, there’s demand for tools that not only scrape the web to inform what those AI bots do, but also return those results in a way that’s easier to use with modern data tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s the promise behind web search startup Nimble, which recently raised a $47 million Series B round, led by Norwest. The New York company’s platform employs AI agents to search the web in real time, verify and validate the results, and structure the information into neat tables that can then be queried like a database.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That last part is crucial here. LLMs and AI agents are great for searching the web, connecting results from a variety of sources, and analyzing them, but they often return the results in plain text, which can be difficult to work with at an enterprise level. And that’s before you factor in hallucinations, the risk of the agent misunderstanding your instructions, or the use of unreliable sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By validating and structuring results into tables, Nimble lets companies use web data as if it were already part of their existing databases. The startup also integrates with enterprise data warehouses and data lakes — large centralized repositories where businesses store and analyze data — offered by the likes of Databricks and Snowflake. That means its AI agents can plug into a business’s trove of data, using it to build context and shape how search results are structured and returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In effect, this lets enterprises have live, structured web data as part of their existing data environments, Nimble CEO and co-founder Uri Knorovich (pictured above, middle) told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Such integrations also allow Nimble’s software to remember constraints — such as how you want the search to be performed, or which data sources to tap. This is particularly useful for applications such as competitor analysis, pricing research, know-your-customer (KYC) processes, brand monitoring, deep research, and financial analysis. (Knorovich noted that Nimble works to ensure all customer data remains within customers’ data infrastructure to comply with data retention and security policies.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To that end, the startup has partnered with Databricks, Snowflake, AWS, and Microsoft to help streamline enterprise deployments that require access to internal data sources. (Databricks also participated in this Series B.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Models can do a lot of things, but most production AI fails aren’t because the models are not good enough — it’s because of a data failure,” Knorovich said. “What we’re seeing today is that enterprises don’t need more AI; they need AI with good, reliable web search&amp;nbsp;… If you nail it down, if you can choose what your agent can search and cannot search, this is the tipping point for enterprises to say, ‘Hey we can actually trust AI. We can actually put AI to work in more use cases.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Knorovich says the ability to search the web in real time at scale, and validate and structure search results, is what sets Nimble apart from other data brokers already in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup currently has more than 100 customers, with the majority of its revenue coming from large enterprises, Fortune 500 companies, and even some Fortune 10 companies, including major retailers, hedge funds, banks, and consumer packaged goods companies, as well as some AI-native startups.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Nimble is tackling a problem that has existed for years without a proper solution and is now becoming of critical urgency,” Assaf Harel, partner at Norwest, said in a statement. “Trusted live web data is increasingly becoming a prerequisite for AI agents performing critical business decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Series B also saw participation from returning investors Target Global, Square Peg, Hetz Ventures, Slow Ventures, R-Squared Ventures, J-Ventures, and InvestInData. Proceeds from the round will be used to expand R&amp;amp;D in multi-agent web search and a governed data layer that processes and validates search results. &lt;/p&gt;

This illegal activity is incredibly hard to disrupt, since it’s backed by sophisticated criminal networks and the perpetrators know that their chances of being caught are slim. With an annual value of $20 billion, according to Interpol, it’s the world’s fourth-most-lucrative criminal enterprise after trafficking in drugs, weapons, and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environmental guardians facing up to these nefarious networks—dispersed alliances of rangers, community groups, and law enforcement officers—have long been ill equipped and underfunded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there is genuine hope that tech could help turn the tide—and prevent poaching at the source.

 &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peptides are everywhere. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Want to lose weight? Get shredded? Stay mentally sharp? A wellness influencer might tell you to take peptides, the latest cure-all in the alternative medicine arsenal. They’re everywhere on social media, and that popularity seems poised to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits and risks of many of these compounds, however, are largely unknown. Some of the most popular peptides have never been tested in human trials. They are sold for research purposes, not human consumption, and some are illegal knockoffs of wildly successful weight-loss medicines. That raises big questions about their safety and effectiveness, which are still unresolved.

(He also said the same thing the year before, by the way.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The implication—fueled by new demonstrations of humanoid robots putting away dishes or assembling cars—is that mimicking human limbs with single-purpose robot arms is the old way of automation. The new way is to replicate the way humans think, learn, and adapt while they work. The problem is that the lack of transparency about the human labor involved in training and operating such robots leaves the public both misunderstanding what robots can actually do and failing to see the strange new forms of work forming around them.&lt;/p&gt;

New Relic is no different. As the data observability company launches an AI agent platform of its own, it knows it isn’t the only game in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;New Relic on Tuesday unveiled a no-code agentic platform that lets enterprises put together data observability AI agents that monitor a company’s data to catch bugs and issues before they disrupt products. Called New Relic Agentic Platform, it lets companies deploy prebuilt agents and manage existing bots as well.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It also supports the model context protocol (MCP), which connects AI applications to external data sources and integrates with other New Relic tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;New Relic isn’t looking to be the only platform that companies use to manage and deploy all of their AI agents, Brian Emerson, the startup’s new chief product officer, told TechCrunch. Instead, the aim is to offer clients the same agent-building capabilities they are getting elsewhere for observability as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re not building this as general purpose,” Emerson said. “We’re building it for outcomes that we care about inside observability. It’s also a world that allows us to work with the rest of the ecosystem or tools that exist out there, but bring it back into the context of problems we’re trying to solve around our personas and the observability domain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Software that lets users manage AI agents has proliferated in recent months as companies look to figure out how to quell enterprises’ fears about giving AI agents access to their data and software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Salesforce was arguably the first to release an agent platform in late 2024, calling it Agentforce. OpenAI launched its own version of the technology, OpenAI Frontier, earlier this year. Research organization Gartner has called such agent platforms “necessary infrastructure” and a critical component of getting enterprises to adopt AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sticking with the theme of increasing enterprise tech adoption, New Relic also revealed new tools focused on OpenTelemetry (OTel), an open source observability framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said its application performance monitoring (APM) agents are now equipped with OTel capabilities, letting enterprises manage OTel data streams alongside their other data sources in one place. This is aimed at solving a previous fragmentation problem that was holding up mass enterprise adoption of the OTel framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Just send your OTel data to us,” Nic Benders, chief technology strategist at New Relic, said. “What we’ve discovered in this process is that it’s kind of a burden for a lot of teams out there in the world to run all of the OTel [data] collectors. So having an OTel like fleet management is something that’s very important.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1440096733.jpg?resize=1200,663" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Companies are increasingly launching software to build and monitor AI agents in an effort to get enterprises to adopt AI.

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s second annual “State of AI in Healthcare and Life Sciences” survey report reveals how the industry is moving from AI experimentation to execution, reaping return on investment (ROI) on core applications like medical imaging and drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry is also embracing open source software and AI models to tackle specific use cases, as well as exploring using agentic AI to speed knowledge retrieval and research paper analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights from this year’s report include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70% of respondents said their organizations are actively using AI, up from 63% in 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;69% said they’re using generative AI and large language models, up from 54%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;82% said open source software and models are moderately to extremely important to their organizations’ AI strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47% said they’re using or assessing agentic AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;85% of executives said AI is helping increase revenue, and 80% said it’s helping reduce costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the next 12-18 months, the most visible and scalable impact of AI will come from logistics and administrative streamlining,” said John Nosta, president of NostaLab, a healthcare think tank. “That’s where adoption curves are already steep — scheduling, documentation, coding, utilization management and care coordination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more below on some of the report’s key findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Adoption Ramps Up Across Healthcare and Life Sciences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI adoption is up across every industry segment in this year’s survey — spanning digital healthcare, pharmaceutical and biotechnology, payers and providers, and medical technology and tools — with digital healthcare leading at 78%, followed by medical technology at 74%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top industry workload was generative AI and large language models, according to 69% of respondents. AI for data analytics and data science was the second most-used workload, followed by predictive analytics. New to the survey, agentic AI ranked fourth, with 47% of respondents saying they’re using or assessing AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scaling generative AI in healthcare starts with focusing on real clinical and operational problems, rather than the technology itself,” said Dr. Annabelle Painter, clinical AI strategy lead at Visiba U.K. “The organizations seeing impact are those that embed AI into existing workflows instead of layering AI on top as a separate tool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="alignnone wp-image-90179 size-full" height="336" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/hc-2026-top-5-ai-areas-by-industry-segment.png" width="1013" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare and life sciences organizations are deploying these AI workloads across a variety of use cases, each specific to their primary functions. For example, 61% of respondents from medical technology said they’re using AI for medical imaging, such as radiologists using it to work more quickly and efficiently, while 57% from pharmaceutical and biotechnology said drug discovery is being driven by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the entire industry, the top AI use cases were clinical decision support (such as radiologists highlighting areas of concern on a scan), medical imaging and workflow optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Budgets to Increase With Strong ROI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI is helping healthcare and life sciences organizations become even better at their core competencies — underscoring strong ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to increasing annual revenue and reducing annual costs, AI is boosting back-office productivity through workflow optimization and is scaling across other key business operations such as patient interaction and administrative tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="alignnone wp-image-90185 size-full" height="386" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/hc-2026-ai-impact-on-revenue-costs.png" width="996" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, 57% of respondents from the medical technology segment reported seeing ROI from deploying AI for medical imaging. Nearly half (46%) of pharmaceutical and biotechnology respondents said AI for drug discovery and development was among their top ROI use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top ROI use case for digital healthcare providers was virtual health assistants and chatbots, according to 37%, while 39% of respondents from payers and providers (which include hospitals, primary care providers and insurance companies) cited administrative tasks and workflow optimization as their top area of ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of AI’s positive impact, 85% of respondents said their AI budgets would increase this year, with another 12% saying budgets would stay the same. For almost half of respondents (46%), AI spending will increase significantly, by more than 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Healthcare organizations that successfully integrate AI are those that explicitly fund and prioritize evaluation as a core operational function, ensuring AI delivers measurable improvements in safety, quality and patient care over time,” said Painter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Open Source for Domain-Specific AI Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaning into open source models and software allows enterprises to build domain-specific applications, lending them greater flexibility and efficiency while boosting business returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healthcare industry has embraced open source, with 82% of survey respondents stating it’s moderately to extremely important to their AI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="alignnone wp-image-90182 size-full" height="222" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/hc-2026-open-source-software.png" width="996" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Open models will shape the intellectual field,” said Nosta. “They are essential for exploration and for keeping the field honest. But in clinical environments where safety, liability and accountability are nonnegotiable, proprietary systems will remain necessary for validation, integration and trust. The key insight here is that discovery will be open, and deployment will demand stewardship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s second annual “State of AI in Healthcare and Life Sciences” survey report reveals how the industry is moving from AI experimentation to execution, reaping return on investment (ROI) on core applications like medical imaging and drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry is also embracing open source software and AI models to tackle specific use cases, as well as exploring using agentic AI to speed knowledge retrieval and research paper analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights from this year’s report include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70% of respondents said their organizations are actively using AI, up from 63% in 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;69% said they’re using generative AI and large language models, up from 54%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;82% said open source software and models are moderately to extremely important to their organizations’ AI strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47% said they’re using or assessing agentic AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;85% of executives said AI is helping increase revenue, and 80% said it’s helping reduce costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the next 12-18 months, the most visible and scalable impact of AI will come from logistics and administrative streamlining,” said John Nosta, president of NostaLab, a healthcare think tank. “That’s where adoption curves are already steep — scheduling, documentation, coding, utilization management and care coordination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more below on some of the report’s key findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Adoption Ramps Up Across Healthcare and Life Sciences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI adoption is up across every industry segment in this year’s survey — spanning digital healthcare, pharmaceutical and biotechnology, payers and providers, and medical technology and tools — with digital healthcare leading at 78%, followed by medical technology at 74%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top industry workload was generative AI and large language models, according to 69% of respondents. AI for data analytics and data science was the second most-used workload, followed by predictive analytics. New to the survey, agentic AI ranked fourth, with 47% of respondents saying they’re using or assessing AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scaling generative AI in healthcare starts with focusing on real clinical and operational problems, rather than the technology itself,” said Dr. Annabelle Painter, clinical AI strategy lead at Visiba U.K. “The organizations seeing impact are those that embed AI into existing workflows instead of layering AI on top as a separate tool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="alignnone wp-image-90179 size-full" height="336" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/hc-2026-top-5-ai-areas-by-industry-segment.png" width="1013" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare and life sciences organizations are deploying these AI workloads across a variety of use cases, each specific to their primary functions. For example, 61% of respondents from medical technology said they’re using AI for medical imaging, such as radiologists using it to work more quickly and efficiently, while 57% from pharmaceutical and biotechnology said drug discovery is being driven by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the entire industry, the top AI use cases were clinical decision support (such as radiologists highlighting areas of concern on a scan), medical imaging and workflow optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Budgets to Increase With Strong ROI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Meta has struck a multi-billion dollar chip deal with AMD that could lead to the Facebook owner taking a 10 percent stake in the group, sending shares in the US chipmaker surging on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social media giant said it would acquire customized chips with a total capacity of 6 gigawatts from AMD as it races to develop and deploy its AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD’s chief executive Lisa Su said that “each gigawatt of compute is worth double-digit billions” under the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD also issued Meta with a performance-based warrant, giving it the option to acquire up to 160 million AMD shares in tranches at an exercise price of $0.01, as the Facebook owner buys successive orders of processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares-for-chips arrangement represents the latest “circular” transaction in the industry and mirrors a deal AMD struck with OpenAI in October, in which the ChatGPT maker was offered a 10 percent stake in the chip group over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in AMD, which has a market capitalization of $320 billion, surged 14 percent in pre-market trading on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is also the latest sign that Big Tech customers are looking to diversify supply away from market leader Nvidia, which last week announced its own multiyear deal with Meta to supply it with “millions” of its chips over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta will receive its first tranche of AMD shares in the second half of this year when the first gigawatt of chips is shipped, Su said. The terms of the warrant are also tied to certain share price thresholds, escalating to $600 for the final tranche. The warrant expires in February 2031.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In some sense, Meta is taking a big bet on AMD, and we are also giving Meta a chance to participate if AMD shareholders do well,” Su said. “From a financial standpoint, each gigawatt of compute is worth double-digit billions.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Su said the warrant structure would help “make sure that we are always a clear seat at the table when [Meta] are thinking about what they need next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said he expected AMD to be “an important partner for many years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta has said that it will almost double its AI infrastructure spending this year to as much as $135 billion, as US tech giants rush to build the data centers to train and run AI software. It is already one of AMD’s biggest AI chip customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t believe that a single silicon solution will work for all of our workloads,” said Santosh Janardhan, Meta’s head of infrastructure. “There’s a place for Nvidia, there’s a place for AMD and… there’s a place for our own custom silicon as well. We need all three.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, AMD will build a custom version of its MI450 AI chips for Meta. They will be used primarily for “inference” workloads, the process of running models after they have been trained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chips need 6 gigawatts of power—equivalent to the amount required by 5 million US households for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly creative funding arrangements to support massive AI infrastructure build-outs have emerged in recent years, leading to warnings about circular financing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD has, for example, helped data center builder Crusoe secure a $300 million loan from Goldman Sachs by offering a backstop guaranteeing the use of its chips if Crusoe is unable to find customers after installing them in an Ohio facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech giants such as Meta, historically flush with cash, are meanwhile facing the prospect of tapping bond and equity markets or stemming capital returns to shareholders to help fund their unprecedented infrastructure plans. The Facebook and Instagram parent raised $30 billion in October, marking its biggest bond sale to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transaction is also the latest sign that Big Tech customers are looking to diversify supply away from market leader Nvidia, which last week announced its own multiyear deal with Meta to supply it with “millions” of its chips over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta will receive its first tranche of AMD shares in the second half of this year when the first gigawatt of chips is shipped, Su said. The terms of the warrant are also tied to certain share price thresholds, escalating to $600 for the final tranche. The warrant expires in February 2031.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In some sense, Meta is taking a big bet on AMD, and we are also giving Meta a chance to participate if AMD shareholders do well,” Su said. “From a financial standpoint, each gigawatt of compute is worth double-digit billions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Su said the warrant structure would help “make sure that we are always a clear seat at the table when [Meta] are thinking about what they need next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said he expected AMD to be “an important partner for many years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta has said that it will almost double its AI infrastructure spending this year to as much as $135 billion, as US tech giants rush to build the data centers to train and run AI software. It is already one of AMD’s biggest AI chip customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t believe that a single silicon solution will work for all of our workloads,” said Santosh Janardhan, Meta’s head of infrastructure. “There’s a place for Nvidia, there’s a place for AMD and… there’s a place for our own custom silicon as well. We need all three.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, AMD will build a custom version of its MI450 AI chips for Meta. They will be used primarily for “inference” workloads, the process of running models after they have been trained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chips need 6 gigawatts of power—equivalent to the amount required by 5 million US households for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly creative funding arrangements to support massive AI infrastructure build-outs have emerged in recent years, leading to warnings about circular financing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD has, for example, helped data center builder Crusoe secure a $300 million loan from Goldman Sachs by offering a backstop guaranteeing the use of its chips if Crusoe is unable to find customers after installing them in an Ohio facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech giants such as Meta, historically flush with cash, are meanwhile facing the prospect of tapping bond and equity markets or stemming capital returns to shareholders to help fund their unprecedented infrastructure plans. The Facebook and Instagram parent raised $30 billion in October, marking its biggest bond sale to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an official briefing, Anthropic’s head of Americas, Kate Jensen, told reporters that the new system would finally deliver on the promise of agentic AI. “2025 was meant to be the year agents transformed the enterprise, but the hype turned out to be mostly premature,” Jensen said. “It wasn’t a failure of effort. It was a failure of approach.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under the new program, companies can use the plug-in system to deploy pre-built agents to help with common enterprise tasks, including financial research and engineering specifications. The result is a major opportunity to grow Anthropic’s enterprise client base — and a significant threat to SaaS products currently performing those functions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We believe that the future of work means everybody having their own custom agent,” Anthropic product officer Matt Piccolella told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Much of the enterprise agents program draws on previously announced technology, particularly Claude Cowork and the plugin system, which was announced in research preview on January 30th. The systems launched today are largely focused on making those tools easier to deploy within a company, including private software marketplaces, controlled data flows, and customized plugins. The result is a system for deploying Claude-powered agents with the same controls a corporate IT department would expect when deploying software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Admins want to be able to have really, really, really tailored workflows and skills for their specific organization,” Piccolella said. “And this allows the admin of a Claude Cowork organization to be able to do this in a very centralized way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The stock plugins included at launch take aim at particular departments present within most companies, including agents designed for finance, legal, and HR departments. Each plugin includes basic skills common across different companies, although Anthropic expects that companies will modify each plugin to bring it in line with unique needs and customs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the case of finance, the stock plugin gives Claude the basic information and data flows necessary to perform market and competitive research, financial modeling, and other common tasks for finance teams. The HR plugin includes skills for generating job descriptions, onboarding materials, and offer letters, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch also includes a number of new enterprise connectors, including integrations for Gmail, DocuSign, and Clay, among others. Previously unavailable, these connectors will allow agents to pull in data and context directly from the linked system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-24-at-9.38.18-AM.jpg?resize=1200,662" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Tuesday, Anthropic unveiled its new enterprise agents program, its most aggressive push yet to integrate agentic AI into everyday workplaces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The company says the&amp;nbsp;model&amp;nbsp;supports questions spanning the full reproductive health spectrum, from early menstrual cycles through menopause.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new model is rolling out in Oura Labs, the company’s opt-in experimental feature hub within the Oura app.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Oura says the new model draws on established medical standards, research, and knowledge sources reviewed by its in-house team of board-certified clinicians and women’s health experts. It also integrates biometric signals and long-term trends to deliver personalized guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As people are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for health guidance, from cycle changes to perimenopause symptoms, Oura says there is a need for models designed specifically for women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3096099" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/oura_WomensHealthModeltransparent.png?w=335" width="335" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Oura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This custom model is a fundamental shift in how we responsibly deploy AI in health to meet the needs of our members,” said Ricky Bloomfield, MD, chief medical officer at Oura, in a press release. “Women’s health is too complex—and too often overlooked—to rely on one-size-fits-all systems. By designing a model specifically for women and grounding it in trusted clinical science and real-world biometric data, we’re setting the standard for how responsible intelligence should be built and expanded across more areas of health, pairing rigorous science with the lived, longitudinal data that makes Oura uniquely powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch of the new women’s health AI model comes as Oura Chief Commercial Officer Dorothy Kilroy told TechCrunch last October that the company’s fastest-growing user segment isn’t gym rats, it’s women in their early twenties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When a user asks Oura Advisor a women’s health question, the chatbot prompts the new model to reference its research and knowledge sources while also analyzing the user’s relevant biometric signals across sleep, activity, cycle, and pregnancy data, as well as stress and more.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new model is intentionally designed to be non-dismissive, reassuring, and emotionally supportive, the company notes. However, it’s not designed to be a doctor, as users shouldn’t use the chatbot for a diagnosis or treatment plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Oura says the model is hosted entirely on Oura-controlled infrastructure, and that conversations are never shared or sold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users who want to access the new model can opt into Oura Labs by navigating to the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Oura app.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Oura announced on Tuesday that it’s launching its first proprietary AI model to enable its AI chatbot, Oura Advisor, to deliver personalized insights around women’s health.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the multiyear agreement, AMD has issued Meta a performance-based warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock — or about 10% of the company — for $0.01 each, structured to vest alongside certain milestones. The full stock award is conditional on AMD’s share price, which would need to hit $600 for Meta to receive its final tranche, per The Wall Street Journal. AMD’s stock closed at $196.60 on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under the agreement, Meta will purchase AMD’s MI540 series of GPUs and its latest generation of CPUs. CPUs are increasingly becoming a core pillar of the AI inference compute stack because they’re efficient, easier to scale, and don’t tie companies solely to Nvidia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The CPU market is absolutely on fire,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said Tuesday morning during an investor briefing. “There is significant demand. It has continued to grow, and it really is a result of the AI infrastructure deployments as inferencing scales, as agentic AI scales, and our portfolio is in an extremely good position.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AMD has been slowly gaining ground as AI firms look to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, which has been the longstanding leader in AI chips and has charged a premium for the title. Last October, AMD and OpenAI struck a similar deal trading equity for an agreement to buy chips. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the firm’s partnership with AMD is “an important step” as it diversifies its compute and works toward “personal superintelligence.” Zuckerberg has defined personal superintelligence as AI systems designed to deeply understand and empower individuals in their everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta has pledged to invest at least $600 billion in U.S. data centers and AI infrastructure over the next several years, including a projected capital expenditure spend of $135 billion in 2026. Meta recently unveiled plans for a $10 billion gas-powered data center campus in Indiana designed for 1 gigawatt of compute capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AMD partnership comes a couple of weeks after Meta struck a multiyear deal to expand its data centers with millions of Nvidia’s latest CPUs and GPUs. The Facebook-maker is also working on its own in-house chips but has reportedly hit delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated with more information from AMD CEO Lisa Su. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/amd-ces-ceo.png?resize=1200,661" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta plans to purchase potentially up to $100 billion worth of AMD chips, enough to drive roughly six gigawatts of data center power demand, the companies announced Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AMD partnership comes a couple of weeks after Meta struck a multiyear deal to expand its data centers with millions of Nvidia’s latest CPUs and GPUs. The Facebook-maker is also working on its own in-house chips but has reportedly hit delays.&lt;/p&gt;

Their goal was to acquire proprietary logic to improve their competing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extraction technique, known as distillation, involves training a weaker system on the high-quality outputs of a stronger one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When applied legitimately, distillation helps companies build smaller and cheaper versions of their applications for customers. Yet, malicious actors weaponise this method to acquire powerful capabilities in a fraction of the time and cost required for independent development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protecting-intellectual-property-like-anthropic-s-claude"&gt;Protecting intellectual property like Anthropic’s Claude&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unmitigated distillation presents a severe intellectual property challenge. Because Anthropic blocks commercial access in China for national security reasons, attackers bypass regional access restrictions by deploying commercial proxy networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These services run what Anthropic calls “hydra cluster” architectures, which distribute traffic across APIs and third-party cloud platforms. The massive breadth of these networks means there are no single points of failure. As Anthropic noted, “when one account is banned, a new one takes its place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one identified case, a single proxy network managed more than 20,000 fraudulent accounts simultaneously. These networks mix AI model distillation traffic with standard customer requests to evade detection. This directly impacts corporate resilience and forces security teams to reconsider how they monitor cloud API traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illicitly-trained models also bypass established safety guardrails, creating severe national security risks. US developers, for example, build protections to prevent state and non-state actors from using these systems to develop bioweapons or carry out malicious cyber activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloned systems lack the safeguards implemented by systems like Anthropic’s Claude, allowing dangerous capabilities to proliferate with protections stripped out entirely. Foreign competitors can feed these unprotected capabilities into military, intelligence, and surveillance systems, enabling authoritarian governments to deploy them for offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these distilled versions are open-sourced, the danger further multiplies as the capabilities spread freely beyond any single government’s control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlawful extraction allows foreign entities, including those under the control of the Chinese Communist Party, to close the competitive advantage protected by export controls. Without visibility into these attacks, rapid advancements by foreign developers incorrectly appear as innovation circumventing export controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, these advancements depend heavily on extracting American intellectual property at scale, an effort that still requires access to advanced chips. Restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-playbook-for-ai-model-distillation"&gt;The playbook for AI model distillation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perpetrators followed a similar operational playbook, utilising fraudulent accounts and proxy services to access systems at scale while evading detection. The volume, structure, and focus of their prompts were distinct from normal usage patterns, reflecting deliberate capability extraction rather than legitimate use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic attributed these campaigns targeting Claude through IP address correlation, request metadata, and infrastructure indicators. Each operation targeted highly differentiated functions: agentic reasoning, tool use, and coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One campaign generated over 13 million exchanges targeting agentic coding and tool orchestration. Anthropic detected this operation while it was still active, mapping timings against the competitor’s public product roadmap. When Anthropic released a new model, the competitor pivoted within 24 hours, redirecting nearly half their traffic to extract capabilities from the latest system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another operation generated over 3.4 million requests focused on computer vision, data analysis, and agentic reasoning. This group utilised hundreds of varied accounts to obscure their coordinated efforts. Anthropic attributed this campaign by matching request metadata to the public profiles of senior staff at the foreign laboratory. In a later phase, this competitor attempted to extract and reconstruct the host system’s reasoning traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic says a third AI model distillation campaign targeting Claude extracted reasoning capabilities and rubric-based grading data through over 150,000 interactions. This group forced the targeted system to map out its internal logic step-by-step, effectively generating massive volumes of chain-of-thought training data. They also extracted censorship-safe alternatives to politically sensitive queries to train their own systems to steer conversations away from restricted topics. The perpetrators generated synchronised traffic using identical patterns and shared payment methods to enable load balancing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Request metadata for this third campaign traced these accounts back to specific researchers at the laboratory. These requests often appear benign on their own, such as a prompt simply asking the system to act as an expert data analyst delivering insights grounded in complete reasoning. But when variations of that exact prompt arrive tens of thousands of times across hundreds of coordinated accounts targeting the same narrow capability, the extraction pattern becomes clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massive volume concentrated in specific areas, highly repetitive structures, and content mapping directly to training needs are the hallmarks of a distillation attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implementing-actionable-defences"&gt;Implementing actionable defences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting enterprise environments requires adopting multi-layered defences to make such extraction efforts harder to execute and easier to identify. Anthropic advises implementing behavioural fingerprinting and traffic classifiers designed to identify AI model distillation patterns in API traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT leaders must also strengthen verification processes for common vulnerability pathways, such as educational accounts, security research programmes, and startup organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies should integrate product-level and API-level safeguards designed to reduce the efficacy of model outputs for illicit distillation. This must be done without degrading the experience for legitimate, paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detecting coordinated activity across large numbers of accounts is an absolute necessity. This includes specifically monitoring for the continuous elicitation of chain-of-thought outputs used to construct reasoning training data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-industry collaboration also remains essential, as these attacks are growing in intensity and sophistication. This requires rapid and coordinated intelligence sharing across AI laboratories, cloud providers, and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has published its findings about Claude being targeted by AI model distillation campaigns to provide a more holistic picture of the landscape and make the evidence available to all stakeholders.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Backed by The Chainsmokers, the ProducerAI platform allows users to write natural language requests — something like “make a lofi beat”– to generate music. It uses Google DeepMind’s Lyria 3 music-generation model, which can turn text and even image inputs into audio outputs.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google announced last week that its Lyria 3 capabilities would be introduced into the flagship Gemini app, but ProducerAI makes it possible for users to communicate with the AI model more like it’s a “collaboration partner,” to use the words of Elias Roman, Google Labs’ Senior Director of Product Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“ProducerAI has allowed me to create in new ways,” Roman wrote in a blog post. “I’ve experimented with new genre blends, expressed how I feel with personalized birthday songs for my loved ones, and made custom workout soundtracks for myself and friends.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google also shared that three-time Grammy-winning rapper Wyclef Jean used the Lyria 3 model and Google’s Music AI Sandbox on his recent song “Back From Abu Dhabi.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is not just a machine where you’re clicking a button a hundred times, and then you’re done. It’s a careful kind of curation where you’re going through and saying, ‘Oh, I think that’s something we can use,’” said Jeff Chang, Director of Product Management at Google DeepMind, in a video the company put out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jean recalls wanting to know what a flute would sound like in a track he already recorded, and being able to use Google’s tools to quickly add a flute sound to the mix. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What I want everybody to understand […] is you’re in the era where the human has to be the most creative,” Jean said in the video. “There’s one thing that you have over the AI: a soul. And there’s one thing that AI has over you: the infinite information.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-in-the-music-industry"&gt;AI in the music industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some musicians have ardently opposed the use of AI tools in the music-making process, since it’s almost a given that a generative AI tool was trained on copyrighted data from artists without their consent. Hundreds of musicians, including stars like Billie Eilish, Katy Perry, and Jon Bon Jovi, signed an open letter in 2024 calling on tech companies not to undermine human creativity with AI music generation tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A cohort of music publishers also recently sued the AI company Anthropic for $3 billion, claiming that the company illegally downloaded more than 20,000 copyrighted songs, including sheet music, song lyrics, and musical compositions. (Anthropic was already ordered by the court to offer a $1.5 billion settlement to authors whose books were pirated for AI training.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other artists, however, have embraced the potential of this technology as a way to improve audio quality, rather than as a creative aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Paul McCartney used AI-powered noise reduction systems — the kind of technology that allows Zoom or FaceTime to block out unwanted background noises on your video calls — to clean up a decades-old, low-quality John Lennon demo. The resulting “new” Beatles track, “Now and Then,” won a Grammy in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, AI music generation tools like Suno have created synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her (supposedly organic) poetry into the viral R&amp;amp;B song “How Was I Supposed To Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth&amp;nbsp;$3 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The law remains unclear on the legality of using copyrighted works as training data — one federal judge, William Alsup, ruled last year that training on copyrighted data is legal, but pirating it is not. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1393049411.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The generative AI music tool ProducerAI will become part of Google Labs, the company announced on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“One of the interesting things and some of the inspiration for the work we’ve been doing lately around OpenAI Frontier is we have not yet really seen enterprise AI penetrate enterprise business process,” the AI exec said on the sidelines of the India AI summit held last week in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You’ve got really powerful AI systems that any person can use in their individual capacity.&amp;nbsp;And enterprises are these highly complex organizations with a lot of people, teams, all having to work together, a lot of context.&amp;nbsp;There are very complex goals that have to be achieved using a lot of different systems and tools.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a lot of talk around AI agents taking over business processes and claiming that “SaaS is dead”. While these predictions have moved SaaS stocks at times, they haven’t really come true. In fact, Lightcap said OpenAI was a massive Slack user last year, indicating how much AI firms are still reliant on traditional enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In January, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar posted that the company’s revenue is on the rise, with the startup ending 2025 with over $20 billion in annualized revenue. Lightcap said that demand is strong, without sharing any numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We almost always find ourselves having to manage too much demand. We are still an organization that is growing, and so there is this global demand factor that we would love to be able to meet, and we are working as best as we can to be able to meet,” Lightcap said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, OpenAI is thinking about how to quantify success in the enterprise. Lightcap said that OpenAI will try to measure Frontier’s impact based on “business outcomes, not on seat licenses.” (The comapny hasn’t yet shared pricing for Frontier.) &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Frontier is a way for us to experiment iteratively with how to actually bring AI into the really messy and complex areas of businesses that I think if we get that right, we’re going to learn a lot about both businesses and also AI systems,” Lightcap noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Days after TechCrunch’s conversation, OpenAI partnered with consultancies like Boston Consulting Group (BCG), McKinsey, Accenture, and Capgemini to deploy its technology in an enterprise push. Even rival Anthropic launched plugins for finance, engineering, and design for enterprises to build agents based on Claude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, the company doesn’t have a clear path of integrating recently acquired open-source tool OpenClaw, but Lightcap said that it gives OpenAI “a glimpse into the future” where agents can do “almost anything you want them to be able to do on a computer.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In keeping with the India AI summit, OpenAI has made a number of recent announcements around its business in the world’s largest market. The company said India was the second biggest user base of ChatGPT outside the U.S., with more than 100 million weekly users. Lightcap said that voice as a modality is picking up in India and enabling OpenAI to reach more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Voice is so important here. And voice models now feel good enough and also good enough to run in low-latency and low-bandwidth environments, where you really can start to enable access to technology for a group of people who maybe were more disenfranchised than not,” Lightcap said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also signed an enterprise contract for the usage of its tools and to deploy compute. Lightcap noted India is fourth in India in terms of enterprise seats in Asia, which is low for a populous country, and OpenAI has a lot of scope to expand here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI company is also set to open two new offices in India in Mumbai and Bengaluru. However, these are likely to be sales and go-to-market offices. When I asked Lightcap if these offices would include technical talent, he said, “Never say never.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is also a fear of job impact, especially in countries like India, where the IT services and BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) industry is prominent, as AI tools automate some of the tasks. In the past few weeks, Indian IT company stocks have dipped as the market is taking into account the fact that areas like coding might require fewer humans. Lightcap said that the company is being “grounded” in what it has observed in terms of jobs market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our view is that over time, jobs will change. I think we don’t yet know where, how, or what, but it seems inevitable that work will look different in the future than it looks today.&amp;nbsp;And that’s natural, that’s part of the business cycle.&amp;nbsp;It’s part of the global and dynamic economy that we live in.&amp;nbsp;And so I think what we have to do is be able to obviously have empathy for where jobs are changing at a high rate,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/brad-lightcap-GettyImages-2147824375-1.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Earlier this month, OpenAI launched a new platform called OpenAI Frontier for enterprises to build and manage agents, but OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap said that businesses haven’t yet seen AI adoption at scale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“One of the interesting things and some of the inspiration for the work we’ve been doing lately around OpenAI Frontier is we have not yet really seen enterprise AI penetrate enterprise business process,” the AI exec said on the sidelines of the India AI summit held last week in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You’ve got really powerful AI systems that any person can use in their individual capacity.&amp;nbsp;And enterprises are these highly complex organizations with a lot of people, teams, all having to work together, a lot of context.&amp;nbsp;There are very complex goals that have to be achieved using a lot of different systems and tools.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a lot of talk around AI agents taking over business processes and claiming that “SaaS is dead”. While these predictions have moved SaaS stocks at times, they haven’t really come true. In fact, Lightcap said OpenAI was a massive Slack user last year, indicating how much AI firms are still reliant on traditional enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;

The company said that a new agent being introduced in Opal will allow users to create mini apps that can let them plan and execute tasks using text prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature uses the Gemini 3 Flash model and automatically chooses tools to execute tasks. For instance, it can use Google Sheets to maintain memory across sessions, such as a shopping list for an e-commerce-related app. The new agent creates and plans the next step for the tasks on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3096225" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/interior_design_opal.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google said these agents are natively interactive, which means that if they need more information, they would ask users to enter it or offer them choices to determine next steps, if needed. With this addition, users without technical knowledge could build complex workflows within their apps, the company claims.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The vibe-cooling tool Opal was first introduced for U.S. users in July 2025. The tool lets anyone create mini web apps or remix existing apps. In October 2025, the company rolled out Opal to users in 15 more countries, including Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, and Singapore. And in December, Google added the tool to the Gemini web app, allowing users to create custom apps through a visual editor without writing any code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond Google, many other startups are also building tools that let users build apps via natural language prompts. Lovable and Replit are among the more popular ones, but other startups like former Replika founder’s Wabi, Softbank and Lightspeed-backed Emergent, and Accel-backed Rocket.new are also gaining prominence.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google on Tuesday announced it’s adding a new way to create automated workflows to its vibe-coding app Opal.
