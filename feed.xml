The facilities, built with Fluidstack, are designed for Anthropic’s systems and will focus on power and efficiency needs that come with training and running large models across these data centre sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluidstack provides large GPU clusters to companies such as Meta, Midjourney, and Mistral. The partnership reflects a wider push across the tech industry this year, as many firms increase spending on US infrastructure while the Trump administration urges companies to build and invest inside the country. These moves show how much demand there is for US data centre capacity as AI workloads grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, President Donald Trump instructed his administration to craft an AI Action Plan aimed at making “America the world capital in artificial intelligence.” Several firms later outlined major AI and energy spending plans during Trump’s tech and AI summit in July, many of which involved expanding US data centre operations or securing more compute across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new sites are expected to bring about 800 full-time jobs and 2,400 construction jobs. They are scheduled to come online in phases through 2026 and are meant to support the goals in the AI Action Plan by strengthening domestic compute resources. Company leaders say they want these projects to create stable jobs and improve America’s position in AI research by adding more US data centre capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment also comes at a time when lawmakers are paying closer attention to where high-end compute capacity sits and how much of it stays in the US. Anthropic’s growing US data centre footprint places the company among the largest builders of physical AI infrastructure in the country, reinforcing the push to keep more AI development rooted in the US rather than overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren’t possible before. Realising that potential requires infrastructure that can support continued development at the frontier,” said Dario Amodei, CEO and co-founder of Anthropic. “These sites will help us build more capable AI systems that can drive those breakthroughs, while creating American jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s move comes as OpenAI builds out its own network. The ChatGPT maker has secured more than $1.4 trillion in long-term commitments through partners such as Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle, and major cloud platforms like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. The scale of these plans has raised questions about whether the US power grid and related industries can support such rapid expansion, especially as more firms compete for space, energy, and equipment tied to US data centre growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic says its growth has been driven by its technical staff, its focus on safety work, and its research on alignment and interpretability. Claude is now used by more than 300,000 business customers, and the number of large accounts—those producing more than $100,000 in yearly revenue—has grown almost seven times over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal projections reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; suggest the company expects to break even by 2028. OpenAI, by comparison, is said to be projecting $74 billion in operating losses that same year. To keep up with rising demand, Anthropic chose Fluidstack to build facilities tailored to its hardware needs, pointing to the company’s speed and its ability to deliver large-scale power capacity on tight timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We selected Fluidstack as our partner for its ability to move with exceptional agility, enabling rapid delivery of gigawatts of power,” an Anthropic leader said. Gary Wu, co-founder and CEO of Fluidstack, added: “Fluidstack was built for this moment. We’re proud to partner with frontier AI leaders like Anthropic to accelerate and deploy the infrastructure necessary to realise their vision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic says this level of spending is needed to support fast-rising usage while keeping its research momentum. The company also plans to focus on cost-efficient ways to scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this fall, the firm was valued at $183 billion. It is backed by Alphabet and Amazon, and a separate 1,200-acre data centre campus built for Anthropic by Amazon in Indiana is already in operation. That $11 billion site is running today, while many others in the sector are still in planning stages. Anthropic has also expanded its compute arrangement with Google by tens of billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These developments come as the federal government’s role in AI infrastructure funding becomes more contested. Last week, OpenAI asked the Trump administration to broaden a CHIPS Act tax credit so it would cover AI data centres and grid equipment such as transformers, according to a letter reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. The request followed criticism over earlier comments from CFO Sarah Friar, who mentioned the possibility of a government “backstop” for the company’s compute deals. OpenAI has since stepped away from the idea, but the episode highlighted ongoing uncertainty over how America’s AI infrastructure will be financed — and who will pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Scott Blake)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Google reveals its own version of Apple’s AI cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110530" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-4.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Over the course of three days of main-stage sessions, I learned about innovations in AI, biotech, and robotics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But as you might imagine, some of this climate reporter’s favorite moments came in the climate sessions. I was listening especially closely to my colleague James Temple’s discussion with Lucia Tian, head of advanced energy technologies at Google.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;They spoke about the tech giant’s growing energy demand and what sort of technologies the company is looking to to help meet it. In case you weren’t able to join us, let’s dig into that session and consider how the company is thinking about energy in the face of AI’s rapid rise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’ve been closely following Google’s work in energy this year. Like the rest of the tech industry, the company is seeing ballooning electricity demand in its data centers. That could get in the way of a major goal that Google has been talking about for years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;See, back in 2020, the company announced an ambitious target: by 2030, it aimed to run on carbon-free energy 24-7. Basically, that means Google would purchase enough renewable energy on the grids where it operates to meet its entire electricity demand, and the purchases would match up so the electricity would have to be generated when the company was actually using energy. (For more on the nuances of Big Tech’s renewable-energy pledges, check out James’s piece from last year.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Google’s is an ambitious goal, and on stage, Tian said that the company is still aiming for it but acknowledged that it’s looking tough with the rise of AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It was always a moonshot,” she said. “It’s something very, very hard to achieve, and it’s only harder in the face of this growth. But our perspective is, if we don’t move in that direction, we’ll never get there.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Google’s total electricity demand more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, according to its latest Environmental Report. As for that goal of 24-7 carbon-free energy? The company is basically treading water. While it was at 67% for its data centers in 2020, last year it came in at 66%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not going backwards is something of an accomplishment, given the rapid growth in electricity demand. But it still leaves the company some distance away from its finish line.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To close the gap, Google has been signing what feels like constant deals in the energy space. Two recent announcements that Tian talked about on stage were a project involving carbon capture and storage at a natural-gas plant in Illinois and plans to reopen a shuttered nuclear power plant in Iowa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with carbon capture. Google signed an agreement to purchase most of the electricity from a new natural-gas plant, which will capture and store about 90% of its carbon dioxide emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That announcement was controversial, with critics arguing that carbon capture keeps fossil-fuel infrastructure online longer and still releases greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One question that James raised on stage: Why build a new natural-gas plant rather than add equipment to an already existing facility? Tacking on equipment to an operational plant would mean cutting emissions from the status quo, rather than adding entirely new fossil-fuel infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company did consider many existing plants, Tian said. But, as she put it, “Retrofits aren’t going to make sense everywhere.” Space can be limited at existing plants, for example, and many may not have the right geology to store carbon dioxide underground.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“We wanted to lead with a project that could prove this technology at scale,” Tian said. This site has an operational Class VI well, the type used for permanent sequestration, she added, and it also doesn’t require a big pipeline buildout.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tian also touched on the company’s recent announcement that it’s collaborating with NextEra Energy to reopen Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear power plant in Iowa. The company will purchase electricity from that plant, which is scheduled to reopen in 2029.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As I covered in a story earlier this year, Duane Arnold was basically the final option in the US for companies looking to reopen shuttered nuclear power plants. “Just a few years back, we were still closing down nuclear plants in this country,” Tian said on stage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While each reopening will look a little different, Tian highlighted the groups working to restart the Palisades plant in Michigan, which was the first reopening to be announced, last spring. “They’re the real heroes of the story,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m always interested to get a peek behind the curtain at how Big Tech is thinking about energy. I’m skeptical but certainly interested to see how Google’s, and the rest of the industry’s, goals shape up over the next few years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

Israeli startup Milestone hopes to help with a platform designed to correlate AI tool usage with engineering metrics, including code quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The catch is that these companies have to give Milestone access to their codebases, a bet that investors initially questioned, CEO and co-founder Liad Elidan told TechCrunch. But with customers including Kayak, Monday, and Sapiens, the startup has now raised a $10 million seed funding round led by San Francisco-based venture firm Heavybit and Israeli fund Hanaco Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an unusual arrangement, Elidan and Milestone’s CTO had gone years without meeting in person by the time they started fundraising. Unlike most of Milestone’s Israel-based team members, Professor Stephen Barrett lives in Ireland and teaches computer science at Trinity College Dublin, where Elidan was once his student and the two bonded through software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the distance, the duo kept in touch over the years and eventually decided to found a startup focused on engineering efficiency, just as coding assistants and other code-generation tools were taking off. GitHub Copilot has since crossed the bar of 20 million users, but companies still lack visibility into how these tools are used and are impacting productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Elidan, Milestone answers these questions by relying on four pillars — codebases, project management platforms, team structure, and the codegen tools themselves — to create what he describes as “a genAI data lake.” In practice, this gives organizations actionable data on which teams use AI and to what effect — thanks to their own information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armed with this data, managers under constant pressure to leverage AI to push productivity are, for instance, able to measure feature delivery speed, Elidan said, but also to find out whether recent bugs were caused by AI-generated code, and to take informed decisions on where to implement these tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This also gives Milestone a front-row seat on ROI — the “holy grail question” that it aims to answer granularly for its customers. But on a high level, he said, “We don’t have a customer that used Milestone and said, ‘Okay, GenAI doesn’t help me, I’m going to revoke all my licenses.’ It’s actually the opposite. They want to try more Gen AI tools.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This fast-paced adoption also means that Milestone has to keep up with a rapidly evolving landscape. “It used to be auto-completes, then it was chat, then it was agentic-based chat, and it keeps going,” Elidan said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s also where Barrett’s academic background helps the team understand the wave of transformation its customers are going through. “A lot of the ways we used to think about engineering are going to have to change,” the professor told TechCrunch. “I think in some sense, AI is filling out the team, and engineers are now becoming managers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To keep up with the tools that power this wave, Milestone says it has partnered with many vendors, such as GitHub, Augment Code, Qodo, Continue and Atlassian — the company that powers Jira and whose venture arm Atlassian Ventures also participated in this seed round.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The round was also supported by angel investors, including GitHub cofounder Tom Preston-Werner, former AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Donovan, Accenture’s senior tech advisor Paul Daugherty, and Datadog’s ex-president Amit Agrawal — who all understand that what Milestone is building is relevant for the enterprise market, Elidan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That enterprise focus was deliberate from day one, with Milestone even saying no to prospective clients that were too small—”a very hard thing to do,” Elidan said, but one that gave the startup clarity around a roadmap requiring enterprise credentials and features. Focus would be his main advice to other founders, and Milestone is taking it: the startup won’t expand into measuring GenAI’s impact on marketing or other functions, even as it grows.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Milestone-Group.png?resize=1200,801" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;GenAI has become a key part of coding workflows, but most companies struggle to track its use, let alone its return on investment.

Bloomberg first reported that the tech giant plans to leverage its partner’s custom chip development to bolster its own struggling semiconductor efforts, a move that looks increasingly pragmatic given Microsoft’s lackluster performance compared to rivals like Google and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The arrangement is straightforward: OpenAI is designing AI chips with Broadcom, and Microsoft gets full access to the innovations. “As they innovate even at the system level, we get access to all of it,” CEO Satya Nadella explained on a newly released interview with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, describing plans to adopt OpenAI’s designs and then extend them for Microsoft’s own purposes.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under a revised partnership agreement, Microsoft secured intellectual property rights to OpenAI’s chip designs while maintaining access to the company’s AI models through 2032. The only carve-out? OpenAI’s consumer hardware, which the ChatGPT maker presumably wants to develop and sell independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The collaboration underscores a broader reality in tech: building cutting-edge AI chips is brutally difficult and expensive. Rather than continuing to struggle alone, Microsoft is betting that OpenAI’s expertise — plus a smartly structured contract — can accelerate its own ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-675949754.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Microsoft is taking a page from OpenAI’s playbook, literally.
