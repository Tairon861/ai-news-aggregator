&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neil Vogel, CEO of People, Inc. (formerly Dotdash Meredith), a publisher that operates over 40 brands, including People, Food &amp;amp; Wine, Travel + Leisure, Better Homes &amp;amp; Gardens, Real Simple, Southern Living, Allrecipes, and others, said that Google is not playing fair because it uses the same bot to crawl websites to index them for the Google search engine as it does to support its AI features.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Google has one crawler, which means they use the same crawler for their search, where they still send us traffic, as they do for their AI products, where they steal our content,” said Vogel, speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He noted that three years ago, Google Search accounted for about 65% of the company’s traffic and that has since dropped to the “high 20s.” (Vogel shared an even more startling statistic with AdExchanger last month, saying that as of several years ago, Google’s traffic accounted for as much as 90% of People Inc.’s traffic from the open web.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m not complaining. We’ve grown our audience. We’ve grown our revenue,” Vogel told conference attendees. “We’re doing great. What is not right about this is: You cannot take our content to compete with us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vogel believes publishers need more leverage in the AI era, which is why he feels it’s necessary to block AI crawlers — automated programs that scan websites to train AI systems — as that can force them into content deals. His company, for example, has a deal with OpenAI, which Vogel described as a “good actor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;People Inc. has been leveraging web infrastructure company Cloudflare’s latest solution to block AI crawlers that don’t pay, prompting AI players to approach the publisher with potential content deals. While Vogel wouldn’t directly name the companies involved, he said they were “large LLM providers.” No deals have been signed yet, but Vogel said the company is “much further along” than before it adopted the crawler-blocking solution.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Vogel pointed out, Google’s crawler can’t be blocked because doing so would also prevent the publisher’s websites from being indexed in Google Search, cutting off that “20%-ish” of traffic that Google still delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“They know this, and they’re not splitting their crawler. So they are an intentional bad actor here,” Vogel declared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Janice Min, the editor-in-chief and CEO at newsletter provider Ankler Media, agreed, calling Big Tech companies like Google and Meta longtime “content kleptomaniacs.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I don’t see the benefit to us in partnering with any AI company right now,” she said, adding that her company blocks AI crawlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, whose company makes the AI-blocking solution (and who was also on the panel), said he believed that things would still change in the future when it comes to how the AI companies behave. He suspected those changes could be prompted by new regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Cloudflare exec also questioned whether fighting the AI companies using legal solutions around things like copyright law, created for the pre-AI era, was the right answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think that it’s a fool’s errand to go down that path, because, in copyright law, typically, the more derivative something is, the more it’s protected under fair use&amp;nbsp;… What these AI companies are doing is they’re actually creating derivatives,” Prince said. “And so if you look at the best case law that’s come out so far, it’s actually said that the use by Anthropic and others — the reason Anthropic settled recently with all the book publishers for $1.5 billion — was for them to be able to preserve the positive copyright ruling that they got.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Prince also proclaimed that “everything that’s wrong with the world today is, at some level, Google’s fault,” because the search giant had taught publishers to value traffic over original content creation, triggering publishers like BuzzFeed to write for clicks. Still, he admitted that Google was in a tough spot right now from a competitive standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Internally, they’re having massive fights about what they do, and my prediction is that, by this time next year, Google will be paying content creators for crawling their content and taking it and putting it in AI models,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Neil-Vogel.jpg?resize=1200,593" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The CEO of the largest digital and print publisher in the U.S. has accused Google of being a bad actor for crawling its websites to support the search giant’s AI products.&lt;/p&gt;

But maybe the markets shouldn’t have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle’s legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup’s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup’s appetite — even if it’s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it’s clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company’s infrastructure — spreading out risk among several cloud providers — and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“OpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,” Dekate said. “This is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company’s diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn’t be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before and provides the infrastructure for TikTok’s sizable U.S. business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Over the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,” Dekate said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-payment-and-power"&gt;Payment and power&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But even as the stock market celebrates the deal, key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has made a string of infrastructure investment announcements over the past year, each one with an eye-popping price tag.&amp;nbsp;OpenAI has committed to spend around $60 billion a year for compute from Oracle and $10 billion to develop custom AI chips with Broadcom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, OpenAI said in June it hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year. That figure includes revenue from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and its API. And while its CEO Sam Altman has painted a rosy picture of its future prospects in terms of subscribers, products, and revenue, the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Power is another question, or more specifically where the companies plan to source the energy needed to run this level of compute.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Industry observers have been predicting a near-term boost for natural gas, though solar and batteries are arguably better positioned to deliver power sooner and at lower cost in many markets. Tech companies are also betting big on nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite market moving headlines, the energy impact of OpenAI’s anticipated growth isn’t entirely unexpected. Data centers are anticipated to consume 14% of all electricity in the U.S. by 2040, according to a report the Rhodium Group published yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Compute has always been a constraint for AI companies, so much so that investors have bought thousands of Nvidia chips to ensure their startups have access to the power they need. Andreessen Horowitz has reportedly purchased over 20,000 GPUs, while Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross rented access to a 4,000 GPU cluster (though maybe Meta owns that now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But compute is worthless without power. To ensure their data centers remain juiced, large tech companies have been snapping up solar farms, buying nuclear power plants, and inking deals with geothermal startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So far, OpenAI has been relatively quiet on that front. CEO Sam Altman has placed several prominent bets in the energy sector, including Oklo, Helion, and Exowatt, but the company itself hasn’t thrown money into the space like Google, Meta, or Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With a 4.5 gigawatt compute deal, that may soon change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company may play an indirect role, paying Oracle to handle the physical infrastructure — something it has extensive experience with — just as Altman invested in startups aligned with OpenAI’s future power needs. That will leave the company “asset light,” something that will undoubtedly please its investors and help keep its valuation in line with other software-centric AI startups and not with legacy tech firms, which are burdened with pricey infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2234339951.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;This week, OpenAI and Oracle shocked the markets with a surprise $300 billion, five-year agreement, part of a surge of new business that sent the cloud provider’s stock skyrocketing.

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;, Tom Nook runs the town shop and provides home loans (paid out in bells, the in-game currency) that keep players perpetually in debt, which is a core mechanic of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As amusing as this type of mod is, it's worth remembering that large language models are always playing roles prompted by humans, pulling statistically plausible outputs from training data that researchers fed into their neural networks when they created or later fine-tuned them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hacking a pre-Internet console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making this amusing amalgam of past and present technology possible required some clever engineering. The technical feat Fonseca pulled off involves a Python script that monitors the game memory through the Dolphin emulator, sends dialogue context to AI models like GPT-5 or Gemini, and writes the responses back into the GameCube's RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GameCube presented unique obstacles for this project. With its 485 MHz PowerPC processor, 24MB of RAM, and no Internet connectivity (unless you add the Modem or Broadband Adapter), the console was "fundamentally, physically, and philosophically designed to be an offline island," Fonseca notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His timing proved fortunate. The &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; decompilation community had just finished reverse-engineering the game's source code, providing readable C instead of PowerPC assembly. This gave him access to the dialogue system's inner workings through a file called m_message.c. (He considered using the Broadband Adapter, but it would have added many layers of additional complexity to the project.)&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than write an entire network stack for the GameCube from scratch, Fonseca implemented what he calls a "memory mailbox." This classic game modding technique uses specific RAM addresses as communication channels. His Python script writes directly to GameCube memory through Dolphin while the game reads from those same locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding these addresses required what Fonseca describes as becoming a "memory archaeologist." He wrote a custom scanner and spent hours in a loop: talk to a villager, freeze the emulator when dialogue appeared, scan all 24 million bytes of RAM for the text string, then cross-reference with different villagers. He eventually located the speaker's name and dialogue buffer at specific addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But discovering the addresses was only half the problem. When you talk to a villager in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;, the game normally displays dialogue instantly. Calling an AI model over the Internet takes several seconds. Willison examined the code and found Fonseca's solution: a watch_dialogue() function that polls memory 10 times per second. When it detects a conversation starting, it immediately writes placeholder text: three dots with hidden pause commands between them, followed by a "Press A to continue" prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So the user gets a 'press A to continue' button and hopefully the LLM has finished by the time they press that button," Willison noted in a Hacker News comment. While players watch dots appear and reach for the A button, the mod races to get a response from the AI model and translate it into the game's dialog format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning the game’s secret language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply writing text to memory froze the game. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; uses an encoded format with control codes that manage everything from text color to character emotions. A special prefix byte (0x7F) signals commands rather than characters. Without the proper end-of-conversation control code, the game waits forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Think of it like HTML," Fonseca explains. "Your browser doesn't just display words; it interprets tags ... to make text bold." The decompilation community had documented these codes, allowing Fonseca to build encoder and decoder tools that translate between a human-readable format and the GameCube's expected byte sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2116853 align-center"&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, he tried using a single AI model to handle both creative writing and technical formatting. "The results were a mess," he notes. "The AI was trying to be a creative writer and a technical programmer simultaneously and was bad at both."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution: split the work between two models. A Writer AI creates dialogue using character sheets scraped from the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; fan wiki. A Director AI then adds technical elements, including pauses, color changes, character expressions, and sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is available on GitHub, though Fonseca warns it contains known bugs and has only been tested on macOS. The mod requires Python 3.8+, API keys for either Google Gemini or OpenAI, and Dolphin emulator. Have fun sticking it to the man—or the raccoon, as the case may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As amusing as this type of mod is, it's worth remembering that large language models are always playing roles prompted by humans, pulling statistically plausible outputs from training data that researchers fed into their neural networks when they created or later fine-tuned them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hacking a pre-Internet console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making this amusing amalgam of past and present technology possible required some clever engineering. The technical feat Fonseca pulled off involves a Python script that monitors the game memory through the Dolphin emulator, sends dialogue context to AI models like GPT-5 or Gemini, and writes the responses back into the GameCube's RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GameCube presented unique obstacles for this project. With its 485 MHz PowerPC processor, 24MB of RAM, and no Internet connectivity (unless you add the Modem or Broadband Adapter), the console was "fundamentally, physically, and philosophically designed to be an offline island," Fonseca notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His timing proved fortunate. The &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; decompilation community had just finished reverse-engineering the game's source code, providing readable C instead of PowerPC assembly. This gave him access to the dialogue system's inner workings through a file called m_message.c. (He considered using the Broadband Adapter, but it would have added many layers of additional complexity to the project.)&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than write an entire network stack for the GameCube from scratch, Fonseca implemented what he calls a "memory mailbox." This classic game modding technique uses specific RAM addresses as communication channels. His Python script writes directly to GameCube memory through Dolphin while the game reads from those same locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding these addresses required what Fonseca describes as becoming a "memory archaeologist." He wrote a custom scanner and spent hours in a loop: talk to a villager, freeze the emulator when dialogue appeared, scan all 24 million bytes of RAM for the text string, then cross-reference with different villagers. He eventually located the speaker's name and dialogue buffer at specific addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But discovering the addresses was only half the problem. When you talk to a villager in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;, the game normally displays dialogue instantly. Calling an AI model over the Internet takes several seconds. Willison examined the code and found Fonseca's solution: a watch_dialogue() function that polls memory 10 times per second. When it detects a conversation starting, it immediately writes placeholder text: three dots with hidden pause commands between them, followed by a "Press A to continue" prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So the user gets a 'press A to continue' button and hopefully the LLM has finished by the time they press that button," Willison noted in a Hacker News comment. While players watch dots appear and reach for the A button, the mod races to get a response from the AI model and translate it into the game's dialog format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning the game’s secret language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply writing text to memory froze the game. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; uses an encoded format with control codes that manage everything from text color to character emotions. A special prefix byte (0x7F) signals commands rather than characters. Without the proper end-of-conversation control code, the game waits forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Think of it like HTML," Fonseca explains. "Your browser doesn't just display words; it interprets tags ... to make text bold." The decompilation community had documented these codes, allowing Fonseca to build encoder and decoder tools that translate between a human-readable format and the GameCube's expected byte sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, he tried using a single AI model to handle both creative writing and technical formatting. "The results were a mess," he notes. "The AI was trying to be a creative writer and a technical programmer simultaneously and was bad at both."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution: split the work between two models. A Writer AI creates dialogue using character sheets scraped from the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; fan wiki. A Director AI then adds technical elements, including pauses, color changes, character expressions, and sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is available on GitHub, though Fonseca warns it contains known bugs and has only been tested on macOS. The mod requires Python 3.8+, API keys for either Google Gemini or OpenAI, and Dolphin emulator. Have fun sticking it to the man—or the raccoon, as the case may be.&lt;/p&gt;
