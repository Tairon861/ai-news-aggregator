It comes with ChatGPT built in, along with an agent, so that you can browse, get direct answers, and have automated tasks performed on your behalf all at the same time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve spent the past several days tinkering with Atlas. I‚Äôve used it to do all my normal web browsing, and also tried to take advantage of the ChatGPT functions‚Äîplus I threw some weird agentic tasks its way to see how it did with those. And my impression is that Atlas is‚Ä¶&amp;nbsp; fine? But my big takeaway is that it‚Äôs pretty pointless for anyone not employed by OpenAI, and that Atlas is little more than cynicism masquerading as software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to know why, let‚Äôs start by looking at its agentic capabilities‚Äîwhich is really where it differentiates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I was browsing Amazon, I asked the Atlas agent to do some shopping for me, using a pre-set prompt of its own suggestion. (‚ÄúStart a cart with items I'm likely to want based on my browsing here and highlight any active promo codes. Let me review before checkout.‚Äù) It picked out a notebook that I‚Äôd recently purchased and no longer needed, some deodorant I‚Äôd recently purchased and no longer needed, and a vacuum cleaner that I‚Äôd considered but decided was too expensive and no longer needed because I bought a cheaper one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would guess that it took 10 minutes or so for it to do all that. I cleaned out my cart and considered myself lucky that it didn‚Äôt buy anything.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I logged onto Facebook, which is already lousy with all sorts of AI slop, I asked it to create a status update for me. So it dug through my browser history and came back with an incredibly long status I won‚Äôt bore you with all of it (and there was a lot) but here are the highlights from what it suggested:&amp;nbsp; ‚ÄúI dipped into Smartsheet and TeamSnap (because editors juggle rosters too!), flirted with Shopify and Amazon (holiday gift‚Äëshopping? side hustle? you decide), and kept tabs on the news ‚Ä¶ . Somewhere in there I even remembered to log into Slack, schedule Zoom meetings, and read a few NYTimes and Technology Review pieces. Who says an editor‚Äôs life isn‚Äôt glamorous? üòä‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Uh. Okay. I decided against posting that. There were some other equally unillustrious examples as well, but you get the picture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Aside from the agent, the other unique feature is having ChatGPT built right into the browser. Notice I said ‚Äúunique,‚Äù not ‚Äúuseful.‚Äù I struggled with finding any obvious utility by having this right there, versus just going to chatgpt dot com. In some cases, the built-in chatbot was worse and dumber.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, I asked the built-in ChatGPT to summarize a &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;article I was reading for me. Yet instead of answering the question about the page I was on, it referred back to the page I had previously been on when I started the session. Which is to say it spit back some useless nonsense. Thanks, AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is marketing Atlas pretty aggressively when you come to ChatGPT now, suggesting people download it. And it may in fact score a lot of downloads because of that. But without giving people more of a reason to actually switch from more entrenched browsers, like Chrome or Safari, this feels like a real empty salvo in the new browser wars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been hard for me to understand why Atlas exists. Who is this browser for, exactly? Who is its customer? And the answer I have come to there is that Atlas is for OpenAI. The real customer, the true end user of Atlas, is not the person browsing websites, it is the company collecting data about what and how that person is browsing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This review first appeared in The Debrief, Mat Honan's weekly subscriber-only newsletter.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25296309743335.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;OpenAI rolled out a new web browser last week called Atlas.
