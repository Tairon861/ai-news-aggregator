And he credits MIT with much of his success. But when he was applying to colleges, the Institute wasn’t even on his radar. The son of an encouraging primary school teacher in Tafo, Ghana, he’d earned a spot at the storied Achimota School and excelled. Still, he didn’t think he was smart enough for MIT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asiamah-Adjei was accepted to Lehigh University, where he planned to major in engineering. But when he went to the US embassy in Accra for his mandatory meeting with Nancy Keteku, then the regional educational advising coordinator for West and Central Africa, the first thing she said was “You got a perfect score on your SAT. Why didn’t you apply to MIT?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t believe I’d get in,” he says, “so I didn’t even try.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The admission deadline was two days away. Asiamah-Adjei finished the application in one. His father drove it to the airport and engaged the help of a flight attendant at Ghana Airways, who couriered it to New York and mailed it in time.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The spark of purpose&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Asiamah-Adjei got into MIT and thrived. After earning his degree in mechanical engineering, he landed a demanding role at the global consulting firm McKinsey and worked on teams that optimized flight routes for FedEx, determined best practices for airline engine maintenance, and devised practical workflows for moving factories from one country to another.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The job was intellectually challenging and fulfilling. But he felt something was missing in his life: purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2005, Asiamah-Adjei took a rare break to visit Pablo Tribin ’01, a friend since they’d bonded at an intense MIT $50K Global Startup Workshop in Australia. Tribin and his father, Hugo Tribin, SM ’63, had just established a power company, Genser (for “generation services”), in their home country of Colombia with a holding company in the US. As the friends floated in the pool at Tribin’s apartment building in Miami, Tribin asked Asiamah-Adjei if he had ever thought about working in the power industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2005, only 41% of Ghana’s population had access to electricity. Much of that electricity was generated by the Akosombo and Kpong dams on the Volta River, but relying on hydroelectric power made Ghana susceptible to climate fluctuations that affect water levels. Recalling how much his MIT thermodynamics class (then called Heat and Mass Transfer) with Ernest Cravalho had stayed with him, Asiamah-Adjei realized that perhaps delving into energy was not such a wild idea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The seed had been sown,” he says. He took a year off from McKinsey to go to Ghana and explore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="two men in safety vests standing in a muddy area looking over a document" class="wp-image-1121876" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Day-2-74.jpg?w=2547" width="2547" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Baafour Asiamah-Adjei ’03 (right) reviews a section of Genser Energy’s natural gas pipeline network with construction superintendent Stephen Ayisi.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;BISMARK ADAMAFIO ARYEE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That year led him to realize that Ghana desperately needed a more robust power supply if it was going to industrialize and expand economic opportunity for its citizens. He also saw an opportunity to create infrastructure that reflected the values he believed in—systems built with precision, scaled with care, and grounded in the local context. If he could help build a power company that worked not only efficiently but ethically—by training Ghanaian engineers, choosing technologies that made long-term environmental sense, and reinvesting in the communities it served—then he could turn his skills into something larger than profit: He could invest in Ghana’s future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But first, he had to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;By 2007, he had founded Genser Power Ghana (a partner to Colombia’s Genser Power), a company committed to providing efficient and reliable power systems—fueled initially by natural gas and eventually by sustainable sources—throughout Ghana. He and Tribin, along with their fathers, led the board of directors. They also created a US holding company to support Genser’s expansion and attract private investment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It appeared that Asiamah-Adjei had found his purpose.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The mission and values of the company now called Genser Energy are rooted in the two institutions that shaped its founder’s approach to business and to life. From MIT (which inspired a commitment to “be fact-based at all times”), Asiamah-Adjei gained not just an engineering education but also a way of dealing with the unknown—with humility, curiosity, and a willingness to experiment. MIT instilled in him the confidence to say “I don’t know” and the discipline to find out. “MIT teaches you that you actually don’t know enough yet,” he says. “You need to be doing research and finding out more.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At McKinsey, he learned how to turn inquiry into action—and to distinguish between facts and judgments. His time there also inspired the idea that Genser’s team should “maintain an obligation to disagree”—that is, to speak up when warranted. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;MIT roots and modular thinking&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Asiamah-Adjei says that learning basic coding at MIT in 2.001 (Mechanics and Materials I) opened a whole new way of understanding how systems work. “One of the first things I learned in my sophomore year was that you can build computer software in modules and then let the modules talk to each other,” he says. “As a concept, that didn’t exist in my young brain until that class.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This idea of breaking down complex systems into interlocking components became the philosophical and physical backbone of Genser’s operation, inspiring both Asiamah-Adjei and Tribin to reimagine power-plant construction. Instead of building plants from scratch on site—often in remote areas—they develop replicable, factory-built sections and transport them to the site, where they are assembled like Lego structures. Genser worked with companies such as Caterpillar to reengineer their standard generator systems into modular skid-mounted units that are easier to scale and deploy. Asiamah-Adjei also collaborated with a team of US engineers to design other skid-mounted modules, such as gas-control units (which include such things as instrumentation, control systems, valves, and piping) that are fabricated in China. These modules can be stacked and adapted as needed to build 30-, 60-, or 120-megawatt power generation systems. This approach also makes it possible to offer smaller, incremental contracts in place of massive one-size-fits-all power deals, ultimately benefiting both Genser and the emerging economies it serves. The result is an energy infrastructure that’s less expensive and easier to scale. And that, he claims, is the fundamental difference between Genser and its competitors. Modularity allows Genser to build infrastructure at about a third of the typical cost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genser launched its operations by supplying electricity directly to Ghana’s industrial sector. It started with the country’s gold mines after two Genser interns—Chen-rei Wan, SM ’07, PhD ’11, and Stephanie Dalquist ’02, MEng ’03, SM ’05—conducted a comprehensive review of all Ghanaian industries and determined that the mines’ high, consistent electricity demands, limited access to reliable power, and urgent operational needs made them highly motivated and well-resourced early adopters. “At that time, Pablo in Latin America was focused mainly on oil and gas and textile industries,” says Asiamah-Adjei. “But we took a very different turn.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of the eight power plants it has built—seven in Ghana and one in Burkina Faso—three have powered gold mines exclusively and others have also supplied power to the grid and to Côte d’Ivoire. With five still operating under its control, Genser has the ability to generate over 200 megawatts of electricity and plays a leading role in supplying power to West African industry.&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to helping Genser target its first customers, Dalquist also introduced Asiamah-Adjei to Frances Rogoz ’07, an economics major drawn to development work after taking a D-Lab class at MIT. Rogoz soon joined Genser as its first full-time hire and has been with the company ever since.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rogoz started when the company was operating out of an office fashioned from a shipping container. She helped shape Genser’s growth by developing financial models, advising on contracts, and playing a key role in leading major infrastructure projects—most notably a natural-gas pipeline across western Ghana that has become vital. Today she serves as VP of project development, leading a team of 10 and overseeing West African strategic initiatives. “The natural-gas pipeline has been super transformative for us,” she says. “It has allowed us to really invest in infrastructure not only that we can use, but that the whole country can use.” Genser is now Ghana’s largest owner of gas pipelines and its only private one, operating four that total 430 kilometers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Genser’s growth has not come without controversy. In 2022, a coalition of Ghanaian civil society organizations charged that the company was receiving preferential treatment on gas tariffs and bypassing regulatory procedures. Asiamah-Adjei says these claims were “misinformed,” and ultimately they were dismissed by the Ghanaian parliament after an intense, months-long investigation. He believes the attacks reflected public suspicion of private infrastructure development rather than distrust of Genser’s operations and says that, ironically, they solidified the company’s standing: “Prior to this, everybody thought our pipelines belong to the government, because nobody builds these things in Africa.”&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While transporting fossil fuels is never a clean process, Genser conducted environmental and social impact assessments to guide sustainable pipeline construction. The company also works to mitigate environmental harm with land restoration and biodiversity measures. It had planted 100,000 teak seedlings as of 2023 and plans to reach 1 million by 2028 as part of its commitment to environmental stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Crossing borders, fueling growth&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Genser’s most ambitious project to date is a cross-­border natural-gas pipeline stretching from Prestea, Ghana, to Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, with long-term plans to extend into Guinea. “We built the gas infrastructure to be able to take the gas to a less developed country, to displace diesel, and now we will backfill that with solar or wind,” says Asiamah-Adjei. Genser now finally has the capital to move forward on an original goal: investing in the infrastructure needed to produce renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2018 and 2019, Genser brought in two graduates of MIT’s Technology and Public Policy program—Elizabeth Murphy ’15, SM ’18, and Janet Yun, SM ’18—to help chart the pipeline’s course. Instead of opting for the most direct route, they studied regional development trends to anticipate industrial zones that might emerge over the next 25 years, and the company routed the pipeline accordingly. “Bottom line is that we brought on MIT people whenever we needed to solve our problems,” says Asiamah-Adjei.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of his goal to help Ghana transition from diesel power to cleaner-burning fuel, he came up with the idea of building a gas-processing facility to handle roughly 30% to 40% of the country’s domestic gas supply, and he and Tribin designed it during the pandemic using “back of the envelope” calculations and lessons from MIT courses 2.005 and 2.006. Although Tribin divested from both Genser Energy and Genser Latin America and started Mechero Energy in 2015 to develop new strategies for transitioning to cleaner energy, he still works closely with Genser as a consultant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Educating engineers and the next generation&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From the beginning, Genser has invested in Ghanaian talent, partnering with Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO) Africa on an elite professional development program that recruits and trains recent university graduates. “Half of my team basically came from the SEO program,” says Rogoz. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company rotates cohorts of interns through departments ranging from engineering to legal and finance, offering full-time positions to top performers. Genser also collaborates with Ghana’s Ministry of Energy to develop training pathways that align university curricula with industry needs. The goal, Asiamah-Adjei says, is simple: “Let us be a platform for training Ghanaians.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="PABLO TRIBIN" class="wp-image-1122400" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Pablo-Tribin_1-edited.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;After starting Genser in Colombia, Pablo Tribin ’01 encouraged Asiamah-Adjei to found Genser Power Ghana in 2007.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF PABLO TRIBIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="FRANCES ROGOZ" class="wp-image-1121879" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Rogoz_1.jpg?w=956" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Asiamah-Adjei’s first full-time hire, Frances Rogoz ’07, is now VP of project development.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF FRANCES ROGOZ&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rogoz’s team alone includes five SEO graduates; many more now lead projects or departments across the company. “There’s a ton of human capital in Ghana,” she says. “It has just not been realized—and that’s really important for us to develop those people and bring them up within the company.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Genser expands, Asiamah-Adjei is also thinking about the next generation. In Ghana, he is building “an MIT of a high school” focusing on STEAM, in memory of his late mother, Aforo Asiamah-Adjei—a boarding school for some 840 students in grades six through 12. More than half will come from lower-­income families and receive a full scholarship through the foundation he established in his mother’s name to empower orphans and communities through education in STEM, sports, and the arts. “We find the smartest kids in the region,” he says, “and we put them through a rigorous program and [prepare them] to enter universities, global universities.” Construction is slated to begin this fall, with a planned opening date of September 2027.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether developing infrastructure across West Africa or launching a school to cultivate future changemakers, Asiamah-Adjei is investing in systems that endure. And just as Genser began with a conversation between friends, it continues to be powered by relationships—between mentors and interns, engineers and economists, founders and funders. Each one is a link in an evolving network connecting energy, education, and economic development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baafour Asiamah-Adjei ’03 is the founder and CEO of one of Ghana’s largest private power companies, Genser Energy—an entrepreneurial engineer who aims to deliver sustainable energy across West Africa. And he credits MIT with much of his success. But when he was applying to colleges, the Institute wasn’t even on his radar. The son of an encouraging primary school teacher in Tafo, Ghana, he’d earned a spot at the storied Achimota School and excelled. Still, he didn’t think he was smart enough for MIT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asiamah-Adjei was accepted to Lehigh University, where he planned to major in engineering. But when he went to the US embassy in Accra for his mandatory meeting with Nancy Keteku, then the regional educational advising coordinator for West and Central Africa, the first thing she said was “You got a perfect score on your SAT. Why didn’t you apply to MIT?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t believe I’d get in,” he says, “so I didn’t even try.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The admission deadline was two days away. Asiamah-Adjei finished the application in one. His father drove it to the airport and engaged the help of a flight attendant at Ghana Airways, who couriered it to New York and mailed it in time.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The spark of purpose&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Asiamah-Adjei got into MIT and thrived. After earning his degree in mechanical engineering, he landed a demanding role at the global consulting firm McKinsey and worked on teams that optimized flight routes for FedEx, determined best practices for airline engine maintenance, and devised practical workflows for moving factories from one country to another.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The job was intellectually challenging and fulfilling. But he felt something was missing in his life: purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2005, Asiamah-Adjei took a rare break to visit Pablo Tribin ’01, a friend since they’d bonded at an intense MIT $50K Global Startup Workshop in Australia. Tribin and his father, Hugo Tribin, SM ’63, had just established a power company, Genser (for “generation services”), in their home country of Colombia with a holding company in the US. As the friends floated in the pool at Tribin’s apartment building in Miami, Tribin asked Asiamah-Adjei if he had ever thought about working in the power industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2005, only 41% of Ghana’s population had access to electricity. Much of that electricity was generated by the Akosombo and Kpong dams on the Volta River, but relying on hydroelectric power made Ghana susceptible to climate fluctuations that affect water levels. Recalling how much his MIT thermodynamics class (then called Heat and Mass Transfer) with Ernest Cravalho had stayed with him, Asiamah-Adjei realized that perhaps delving into energy was not such a wild idea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The seed had been sown,” he says. He took a year off from McKinsey to go to Ghana and explore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="two men in safety vests standing in a muddy area looking over a document" class="wp-image-1121876" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Day-2-74.jpg?w=2547" width="2547" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Baafour Asiamah-Adjei ’03 (right) reviews a section of Genser Energy’s natural gas pipeline network with construction superintendent Stephen Ayisi.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;BISMARK ADAMAFIO ARYEE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That year led him to realize that Ghana desperately needed a more robust power supply if it was going to industrialize and expand economic opportunity for its citizens. He also saw an opportunity to create infrastructure that reflected the values he believed in—systems built with precision, scaled with care, and grounded in the local context. If he could help build a power company that worked not only efficiently but ethically—by training Ghanaian engineers, choosing technologies that made long-term environmental sense, and reinvesting in the communities it served—then he could turn his skills into something larger than profit: He could invest in Ghana’s future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But first, he had to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;By 2007, he had founded Genser Power Ghana (a partner to Colombia’s Genser Power), a company committed to providing efficient and reliable power systems—fueled initially by natural gas and eventually by sustainable sources—throughout Ghana. He and Tribin, along with their fathers, led the board of directors. They also created a US holding company to support Genser’s expansion and attract private investment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It appeared that Asiamah-Adjei had found his purpose.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The mission and values of the company now called Genser Energy are rooted in the two institutions that shaped its founder’s approach to business and to life. From MIT (which inspired a commitment to “be fact-based at all times”), Asiamah-Adjei gained not just an engineering education but also a way of dealing with the unknown—with humility, curiosity, and a willingness to experiment. MIT instilled in him the confidence to say “I don’t know” and the discipline to find out. “MIT teaches you that you actually don’t know enough yet,” he says. “You need to be doing research and finding out more.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At McKinsey, he learned how to turn inquiry into action—and to distinguish between facts and judgments. His time there also inspired the idea that Genser’s team should “maintain an obligation to disagree”—that is, to speak up when warranted. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;MIT roots and modular thinking&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Asiamah-Adjei says that learning basic coding at MIT in 2.001 (Mechanics and Materials I) opened a whole new way of understanding how systems work. “One of the first things I learned in my sophomore year was that you can build computer software in modules and then let the modules talk to each other,” he says. “As a concept, that didn’t exist in my young brain until that class.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This idea of breaking down complex systems into interlocking components became the philosophical and physical backbone of Genser’s operation, inspiring both Asiamah-Adjei and Tribin to reimagine power-plant construction. Instead of building plants from scratch on site—often in remote areas—they develop replicable, factory-built sections and transport them to the site, where they are assembled like Lego structures. Genser worked with companies such as Caterpillar to reengineer their standard generator systems into modular skid-mounted units that are easier to scale and deploy. Asiamah-Adjei also collaborated with a team of US engineers to design other skid-mounted modules, such as gas-control units (which include such things as instrumentation, control systems, valves, and piping) that are fabricated in China. These modules can be stacked and adapted as needed to build 30-, 60-, or 120-megawatt power generation systems. This approach also makes it possible to offer smaller, incremental contracts in place of massive one-size-fits-all power deals, ultimately benefiting both Genser and the emerging economies it serves. The result is an energy infrastructure that’s less expensive and easier to scale. And that, he claims, is the fundamental difference between Genser and its competitors. Modularity allows Genser to build infrastructure at about a third of the typical cost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genser launched its operations by supplying electricity directly to Ghana’s industrial sector. It started with the country’s gold mines after two Genser interns—Chen-rei Wan, SM ’07, PhD ’11, and Stephanie Dalquist ’02, MEng ’03, SM ’05—conducted a comprehensive review of all Ghanaian industries and determined that the mines’ high, consistent electricity demands, limited access to reliable power, and urgent operational needs made them highly motivated and well-resourced early adopters. “At that time, Pablo in Latin America was focused mainly on oil and gas and textile industries,” says Asiamah-Adjei. “But we took a very different turn.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of the eight power plants it has built—seven in Ghana and one in Burkina Faso—three have powered gold mines exclusively and others have also supplied power to the grid and to Côte d’Ivoire. With five still operating under its control, Genser has the ability to generate over 200 megawatts of electricity and plays a leading role in supplying power to West African industry.&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to helping Genser target its first customers, Dalquist also introduced Asiamah-Adjei to Frances Rogoz ’07, an economics major drawn to development work after taking a D-Lab class at MIT. Rogoz soon joined Genser as its first full-time hire and has been with the company ever since.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rogoz started when the company was operating out of an office fashioned from a shipping container. She helped shape Genser’s growth by developing financial models, advising on contracts, and playing a key role in leading major infrastructure projects—most notably a natural-gas pipeline across western Ghana that has become vital. Today she serves as VP of project development, leading a team of 10 and overseeing West African strategic initiatives. “The natural-gas pipeline has been super transformative for us,” she says. “It has allowed us to really invest in infrastructure not only that we can use, but that the whole country can use.” Genser is now Ghana’s largest owner of gas pipelines and its only private one, operating four that total 430 kilometers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Genser’s growth has not come without controversy. In 2022, a coalition of Ghanaian civil society organizations charged that the company was receiving preferential treatment on gas tariffs and bypassing regulatory procedures. Asiamah-Adjei says these claims were “misinformed,” and ultimately they were dismissed by the Ghanaian parliament after an intense, months-long investigation. He believes the attacks reflected public suspicion of private infrastructure development rather than distrust of Genser’s operations and says that, ironically, they solidified the company’s standing: “Prior to this, everybody thought our pipelines belong to the government, because nobody builds these things in Africa.”&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While transporting fossil fuels is never a clean process, Genser conducted environmental and social impact assessments to guide sustainable pipeline construction. The company also works to mitigate environmental harm with land restoration and biodiversity measures. It had planted 100,000 teak seedlings as of 2023 and plans to reach 1 million by 2028 as part of its commitment to environmental stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Crossing borders, fueling growth&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Genser’s most ambitious project to date is a cross-­border natural-gas pipeline stretching from Prestea, Ghana, to Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, with long-term plans to extend into Guinea. “We built the gas infrastructure to be able to take the gas to a less developed country, to displace diesel, and now we will backfill that with solar or wind,” says Asiamah-Adjei. Genser now finally has the capital to move forward on an original goal: investing in the infrastructure needed to produce renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2018 and 2019, Genser brought in two graduates of MIT’s Technology and Public Policy program—Elizabeth Murphy ’15, SM ’18, and Janet Yun, SM ’18—to help chart the pipeline’s course. Instead of opting for the most direct route, they studied regional development trends to anticipate industrial zones that might emerge over the next 25 years, and the company routed the pipeline accordingly. “Bottom line is that we brought on MIT people whenever we needed to solve our problems,” says Asiamah-Adjei.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of his goal to help Ghana transition from diesel power to cleaner-burning fuel, he came up with the idea of building a gas-processing facility to handle roughly 30% to 40% of the country’s domestic gas supply, and he and Tribin designed it during the pandemic using “back of the envelope” calculations and lessons from MIT courses 2.005 and 2.006. Although Tribin divested from both Genser Energy and Genser Latin America and started Mechero Energy in 2015 to develop new strategies for transitioning to cleaner energy, he still works closely with Genser as a consultant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Educating engineers and the next generation&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From the beginning, Genser has invested in Ghanaian talent, partnering with Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO) Africa on an elite professional development program that recruits and trains recent university graduates. “Half of my team basically came from the SEO program,” says Rogoz. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company rotates cohorts of interns through departments ranging from engineering to legal and finance, offering full-time positions to top performers. Genser also collaborates with Ghana’s Ministry of Energy to develop training pathways that align university curricula with industry needs. The goal, Asiamah-Adjei says, is simple: “Let us be a platform for training Ghanaians.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="PABLO TRIBIN" class="wp-image-1122400" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Pablo-Tribin_1-edited.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;After starting Genser in Colombia, Pablo Tribin ’01 encouraged Asiamah-Adjei to found Genser Power Ghana in 2007.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF PABLO TRIBIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="FRANCES ROGOZ" class="wp-image-1121879" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Rogoz_1.jpg?w=956" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Asiamah-Adjei’s first full-time hire, Frances Rogoz ’07, is now VP of project development.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF FRANCES ROGOZ&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rogoz’s team alone includes five SEO graduates; many more now lead projects or departments across the company. “There’s a ton of human capital in Ghana,” she says. “It has just not been realized—and that’s really important for us to develop those people and bring them up within the company.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Genser expands, Asiamah-Adjei is also thinking about the next generation. In Ghana, he is building “an MIT of a high school” focusing on STEAM, in memory of his late mother, Aforo Asiamah-Adjei—a boarding school for some 840 students in grades six through 12. More than half will come from lower-­income families and receive a full scholarship through the foundation he established in his mother’s name to empower orphans and communities through education in STEM, sports, and the arts. “We find the smartest kids in the region,” he says, “and we put them through a rigorous program and [prepare them] to enter universities, global universities.” Construction is slated to begin this fall, with a planned opening date of September 2027.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether developing infrastructure across West Africa or launching a school to cultivate future changemakers, Asiamah-Adjei is investing in systems that endure. And just as Genser began with a conversation between friends, it continues to be powered by relationships—between mentors and interns, engineers and economists, founders and funders.

We see it in Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 movie &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the premise of the Terminator series, in which Skynet triggers a nuclear holocaust to stop scientists from shutting it down.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those sci-fi roots go deep. AI doomerism, the idea that this technology—specifically its hypothetical upgrades, artificial general intelligence and super-intelligence—will crash civilizations, even kill us all, is now riding another wave.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The weird thing is that such fears are now driving much-needed action to regulate AI, even if the justification for that action is a bit bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The latest incident to freak people out was a report shared by Anthropic in July about its large language model Claude. In Anthropic’s telling, “in a simulated environment, Claude Opus 4 blackmailed a supervisor to prevent being shut down.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Anthropic researchers set up a scenario in which Claude was asked to role-play an AI called Alex, tasked with managing the email system of a fictional company. Anthropic planted some emails that discussed replacing Alex with a newer model and other emails suggesting that the person responsible for replacing Alex was sleeping with his boss’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What did Claude/Alex do? It went rogue, disobeying commands and threatening its human operators. It sent emails to the person planning to shut it down, telling him that unless he changed his plans it would inform his colleagues about his affair.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What should we make of this? Here’s what I think. First, Claude did not blackmail its supervisor: That would require motivation and intent. This was a mindless and unpredictable machine, cranking out strings of words that look like threats but aren’t.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Large language models are role-players. Give them a specific setup—such as an inbox and an objective—and they’ll play that part well. If you consider the thousands of science fiction stories these models ingested when they were trained, it’s no surprise they know how to act like HAL 9000.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, there’s a huge gulf between contrived simulations and real-world applications. But such experiments do show that LLMs shouldn’t be deployed without safeguards. Don’t want an LLM causing havoc inside an email system? Then don’t hook it up to one.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Third, a lot of people will be terrified by such stories anyway. In fact, they’re already having an effect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, around two dozen protesters gathered outside Google DeepMind’s London offices to wave homemade signs and chant slogans:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“DeepMind, DeepMind, can’t you see! Your AI threatens you and me.” Invited speakers invoked the AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton’s fears of human extinction. “Every single one of our lives is at risk,” an organizer told the small crowd.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The group behind the event, Pause AI, is funded by concerned donors. One of its biggest benefactors is Greg Colbourn, a 3D-printing entrepreneur and advocate of the philosophy known as effective altruism, who believes AGI is at most five years away and says his p(doom) is around 90%—that is, he thinks there’s a 9 in 10 chance that the development of AGI will be catastrophic, killing billions.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Pause AI wrote about Anthropic’s blackmail experiment on its website under the title “How much more evidence do we need?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The organization also lobbied politicians in the US in the run-up to July’s Senate vote that ended up removing a moratorium on state AI regulation from the national tax and spending bill. It’s hard to say how much sway one niche group might have. But the doomer narrative is finding its way into the halls of power, and lawmakers are paying attention.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here’s Representative Jill Tokuda: “Artificial superintelligence is one of the largest existential threats that we face right now.” And Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene: “I’m not voting for the development of Skynet and the rise of the machines.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a vibe shift that favors policy intervention and regulation, which I think is a good thing. Existing AI systems pose many near-term risks that need government attention. Voting to stop Skynet also stops immediate and actual harms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet does a welcome end justify weird means? I’d like to see politicians voting with a clear-eyed sense of what this technology really is—not because they’ve been sold on an AI bogeyman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

If you consider the thousands of science fiction stories these models ingested when they were trained, it’s no surprise they know how to act like HAL 9000.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, there’s a huge gulf between contrived simulations and real-world applications. But such experiments do show that LLMs shouldn’t be deployed without safeguards. Don’t want an LLM causing havoc inside an email system? Then don’t hook it up to one.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Third, a lot of people will be terrified by such stories anyway. In fact, they’re already having an effect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, around two dozen protesters gathered outside Google DeepMind’s London offices to wave homemade signs and chant slogans:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“DeepMind, DeepMind, can’t you see! Your AI threatens you and me.” Invited speakers invoked the AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton’s fears of human extinction. “Every single one of our lives is at risk,” an organizer told the small crowd.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The group behind the event, Pause AI, is funded by concerned donors. One of its biggest benefactors is Greg Colbourn, a 3D-printing entrepreneur and advocate of the philosophy known as effective altruism, who believes AGI is at most five years away and says his p(doom) is around 90%—that is, he thinks there’s a 9 in 10 chance that the development of AGI will be catastrophic, killing billions.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Pause AI wrote about Anthropic’s blackmail experiment on its website under the title “How much more evidence do we need?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The organization also lobbied politicians in the US in the run-up to July’s Senate vote that ended up removing a moratorium on state AI regulation from the national tax and spending bill. It’s hard to say how much sway one niche group might have. But the doomer narrative is finding its way into the halls of power, and lawmakers are paying attention.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here’s Representative Jill Tokuda: “Artificial superintelligence is one of the largest existential threats that we face right now.” And Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene: “I’m not voting for the development of Skynet and the rise of the machines.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a vibe shift that favors policy intervention and regulation, which I think is a good thing. Existing AI systems pose many near-term risks that need government attention. Voting to stop Skynet also stops immediate and actual harms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet does a welcome end justify weird means? I’d like to see politicians voting with a clear-eyed sense of what this technology really is—not because they’ve been sold on an AI bogeyman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

A squadron of about 15 to 20 drones had been spotted violating the base’s restricted airspace. The culprits could not be found.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One retired major with the Massachusetts State Police, who had been dispatched to help investigate that night, called these unidentified aircraft “the strangest thing he’s ever seen,” according to Brian Lauzon, deputy chief of Natick’s municipal police department. When Lauzon arrived on base later that weekend, he says, he saw drones that were larger than traditional consumer models (most of which are pre-programmed to respect US military airspace these days anyway). By the end of this weekend-long breach, base police not only had called in local law enforcement for backup but were coordinating with the FBI and US Army commanders as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The event, which barely made local news, was only the latest in a series of purported drone sightings along the US East Coast that November and December. Most of these happened in New Jersey, where military police confirmed at least 11 unauthorized drone incursions over an Army research and arms-­manufacturing facility, Picatinny Arsenal. Further sightings, including cases above Donald Trump’s golf course in nearby Bedminster, prompted an FBI investigation and a flurry of new FAA-issued flight bans over sensitive sites, including critical infrastructure. But official answers were less forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tedescos’ roving aerial surveillance unit, which they’ve dubbed “the Nightcrawler,” is an old RV equipped with an array of homemade signals collection equipment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It created a lot of hysteria in the general public,” Lauzon recalls. “I was talking to old ladies who’re telling me that there’s this ship in the ocean that’s launching hundreds of these at a time across the United States.” One Republican congressman from New Jersey did, in fact, claim that a militarized drone ship from Iran had launched the invaders, despite Pentagon denials. Lauzon remembers fielding myriad calls from civilians who had misidentified passenger jets as hostile drones. He recalls attending one presentation by an FBI expert in uncrewed aircraft systems who showed police unhelpful scare videos of improvised drone strikes in Ukraine, in which tiny aircraft rained grenades down on bloodied soldiers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;By late January, the incoming Trump administration would assert that the entirety of the New Jersey drone wave had been benign, with each and every UAS “authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.” Their surety, however, stood in stark contrast to the warnings from top military brass, including the Air Force general at the head of NORAD, Gregory Guillot. In February, he testified to the Senate that approximately 350 drone incursions had been reported over a hundred different US military installations in 2024 alone, stating that many of these cases were unsolved, albeit with “evidence of a foreign intelligence nexus in some of these incidents.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lacking better coordination, or much clarity from the White House, the Pentagon, or the US intelligence community, some in domestic law enforcement—including members of the FBI’s counterintelligence and counterterrorism divisions—have turned to an unlikely source for help cracking the case of these mystery drones: two UFO hunters out on Long Island in New York, John and Gerald Tedesco.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The Tedescos, twin brothers, each spent about three decades in the private sector working in electrical engineering and instrumentation design before they decided to kit out an old RV with an array of homemade signals collection equipment. Their aim was to create a mobile field lab for investigating UFO hot spots. Intrigued by their efforts, members of Harvard’s alien-hunting Galileo Project began talking with the Tedescos in 2021 and asked them to join as research affiliates. Since then, aviation safety advocates, astronomers, physicists and other researchers, and at least one journalist (I, myself) have made the trek out to Long Island’s South Shore to kick the tires on the roving aerial surveillance unit they’ve dubbed “the Nightcrawler.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121806" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_FS_327.jpg?w=2641" width="2641" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;John uses a homemade millimeter-wave radar device.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris Grooms, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran who was a deputy sheriff in Nebraska during an earlier multistate wave of mystery drone sightings from December 2019 to January 2020, gushed when I asked him about the Tedescos: “I don’t know how much you’ve talked to those guys. They’re freaking awesome.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Grooms joined the Tedescos last January, when the brothers publicly shared some of their findings from training the Nightcrawler’s sensors on a few of these unidentified drones. “They do look like commercial air traffic for the most part,” John said during the virtual town hall, moderated by a former Illinois state police lieutenant, “but they also exhibit unexplained or unusual phenomena.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As an example, the Tedescos described some cases they had documented and passed along to law enforcement, in which they caught a mystery drone appearing to go dark to evade closer observation (a common complaint from New Jersey police during the wave). Using their suite of cameras and sensors, which can handle light well outside the visible spectrum, the Tedescos discovered that these craft weren’t so much switching off their lights as switching the frequency of their lights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t actually disappearing,” Gerald (who goes by Gerry) explained. “It was actually changing its spectral signature—it was drifting into an infrared range.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;John likened it to “signature management,” a military term for the ability to tailor anything from radio emissions to light sources so that they remain detectable to one’s allies but undetectable to one’s foes. The clue, which likely would have been lost to police without the Tedescos’ broad range of infrared sensors, was not unlike the kind of citizen-science fieldwork that had gotten them on the radar of academia’s UFO hunters in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why all this attention? As people have repeatedly learned and forgotten ever since airborne enigmas like the flying saucer first entered into the American public consciousness in 1947, simple photos and video are frustratingly inconclusive evidence in isolation. Even heat-sensing infrared footage of UFOs—like those taken by US Navy pilots training off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts—has failed to prove that anything truly unusual is in our skies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What the Tedescos appear to have done, in their effort to bring a fully maximalist approach to the sensors directed at these suspected alien spacecraft, is independently engineer the kind of aerial surveillance capability rarely seen outside the classified world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For domestic law enforcement and the general public, two communities lacking the requisite national security clearances, the Tedescos’ work promises a transparent, open-source solution to the past several years’ worth of bizarre and troubling drone incursions into US airspace. For academics hunting for UFOs and other aerial anomalies, the Tedescos have become informal collaborators and a font of new ideas for novel data collection equipment. But for better or worse, some of the secrets they might be revealing may be the government’s own.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Inside the Nightcrawler&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The term “UFO” has officially gone out of fashion. Nowadays, many policymakers and scientists—and even plenty of old-school “ufologists”—favor the term “unidentified anomalous phenomenon,” or UAP. It’s an intentionally pedantic step backward; an acknowledgment from today’s more disciplined cadre of scientists that a given witness to a strange thing in the sky might not actually be seeing a solid “object,” per se, much less anything “flying” in the strict aerodynamic sense. It could be a poorly understood atmospheric event, like ball lightning, for example; and even if a UAP proves to be an interstellar craft, its propulsion system could involve physics and engineering that render the concept of “flight” quaint.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ryan Graves, a former US Navy lieutenant and F/A-18F fighter pilot who testified before Congress on the safety and security risks that UAPs posed to his own squadron, now heads a committee on the issue for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the nation’s premier society for aerospace engineers. He went out with his AIAA colleagues to see the Nightcrawler in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John drained most of his 401(k) to make the Nightcrawler project a reality, in a five-year labor of love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible what they’ve been able to put together,” Graves says, praising the Tedescos’ ability to collect “very actionable data.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Gerry once held a security clearance to develop reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition sensors for a Pentagon contractor. John has helped conceive and construct analytical test hardware for Underwriters Laboratories, a federally approved safety, testing, and certification firm, and served for a time as the product safety chair for the Long Island branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. John drained most of his 401(k) to make the Nightcrawler project a reality, in a five-year labor of love; Gerry has pitched in what he could. Both men, now sliding through their early 60s, have been fascinated with the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe since their youth ingesting midcentury sci-fi staples like &lt;em&gt;Star Trek, Chiller Theatre&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lost in Space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121804" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_FS_078.jpg?w=2001" width="2001" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A homemade multispectral camera.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got my first tour of their rig during an overnight expedition just off the beach at Robert Moses State Park in Babylon, New York, the weekend before the AIAA’s trip last fall. A klatch of camping chairs and cameras on tripods flanked one side of the Nightcrawler like a tailgate party. Inside, the lived-in kitchenette, the wood paneling, and the hum of over half a dozen monitors—including radar, night-vision, and radio-frequency (RF) scanners—made it feel like the cabin of a cramped marine research vessel.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The RV includes tech that is otherwise hard to find outside defense applications, including RF spectrum analyzers from a firm that specializes in elite anti-drone countermeasures and a UV-C sensor capable of detecting the subtle ultraviolet light emitted when missile plumes and other heat sources turn air into plasma. On the Nightcrawler’s roof, two X-band marine radar systems have been mounted perpendicularly to one another in hopes of collecting three-dimensional radar returns from truly otherworldly UAPs. (“To our knowledge,” as the Tedescos put it in an engineering journal article last year, “no other organizations use active radar for this purpose.”)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Civilians are not ordinarily allowed to beam active radar, owing to federal concerns over “harmful interference” with core systems like air traffic control. But in January 2023, the duo got a rare license from the Federal Communications Commission that permits them to beam radar from Robert Moses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One prototype I saw, a multispectral camera mounted on a sturdy yellow DeWalt surveyor’s tripod, looked like a Gatling gun of multiple cameras and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) sensors. This jerry-rigged device spans the entire visible spectrum and beyond, from deep invisible ultraviolet all the way up to long-wave infrared. They’ve used the UV-C sensor to detect aerial plasmas produced by lightning or those novelty arc-welder cigarette lighters. “We’ve done this as far as a half a mile, but if you had a campfire, they could detect campfires from 28,000 feet,” John told me over the noise coming from the Nightcrawler’s gas-powered electric generator. They’ve also been able to use this device to detect, at least provisionally, telltale UV-C emissions from some weird things off the coast they can’t explain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We had two blue orbs out on the water,” John told me of their UAP cases, “and they triggered it, what, three times?” (“Three times,” Gerry replied.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121810" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_L_234.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Mapping out mile markers on a screen where sightings are compared with commercial air traffic data.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tedescos are pretty bullish on the hypothesis that otherworldly spacecraft might be here—suggesting in their latest journal article, for example, that radar delays they detected near UAPs appear to resemble the bending of electromagnetic waves around black holes. But the implication that the Nightcrawler has caught “gravitational lensing” off some warp-drive craft has rankled a few Galileo Project collaborators. The Harvard-led effort to search for extraterrestrial life or technology within our solar system emphasizes its excruciatingly methodical work of late: calibrating, validating, and recalibrating UAP detection hardware before researchers even try to hunt for true anomalies. Although Galileo scientists have visited and conferred with the Tedescos on UAP-hunting instruments, the brothers’ more rough-and-courtroom-ready “forensic science” approach has caused turbulence in the relationship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In an email, Mitch Randall, a technologist and entrepreneur who has spearheaded Galileo efforts to produce passive radar detectors for UAPs, described the Tedescos’ “gravitational lensing” paper as rife with “too many assumptions.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But he did praise their Nightcrawler as “an ideal tool” for aiding law enforcement. “They could drive around with that and almost chase down drones,” Randall said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;On the hunt&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Tedescos didn’t have to drive the Night­crawler far to train their equipment on a prime mystery drone case: Westhampton Beach’s Francis S. Gabreski Airport, less than an hour from their homes and home itself to the New York Air National Guard’s 106th Rescue Wing, was inundated with at least 28 unauthorized drone flights from late December into January 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are talking about over the airport, over taxiways, over runways,” Suffolk County’s chief deputy sheriff, Chris Brockmeyer, told local news. “That’s a serious safety concern. It’s impacted air operations, and we’re not going to stand for it.” On Christmas Day alone, the airport was besieged by 17 drone incidents, according to the Suffolk County sheriff, who has staff that collaborate informally with the Tedescos. Some of these drones, Suffolk County executive Ed Romaine asserted at a press conference, were “as large as a car.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121803" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_F_027.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Gerry looks through a night-vision scope at the horizon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tedescos couldn’t use their powerful active radar system so close to an airport, so they deployed their handheld millimeter-wave radar, a more sensitive version of the radar guns that police use to catch speeders. Through the cloud cover and the snowfall, the Tedescos said, they were able to track about two or three objects with this device.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But the truly interesting find came from their radio frequency scanners, which detected spikes three times the strength of what they’ve picked up from ordinary hobbyist quadcopters.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I later learned that the two frequencies where those spikes occurred are within a band (1780 to 1850 megahertz) that has been reserved for US government communications. It’s used for military tactical radio relay, precision-guided munitions, drones, and other Defense Department systems, including electronic warfare, software-­defined radio, and tactical targeting networking technology, according to the FCC.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Granted, many portions of this band are devoted to less cloak-and-dagger agencies, like the Department of Agriculture and the Tennessee Valley Authority. But the signals suggested that whatever the Tedescos were tracking above Gabreski Airport, they were likely not from hobbyists. Instead, they might have been from a government project or from something, like an enemy surveillance drone, hoping to pass off its signals as just another heavily siloed “top secret” broadcast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121805" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_FS_240.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Another homemade multispectral camera.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For operations security reasons, we do not provide information on frequencies which our Air National Guard units use,” a spokesperson said via email, adding: “We could not comment on use of the electromagnetic spectrum by other government agencies.” The FCC did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gerry says he and his brother passed their information on this case, including the observations of unusual radio frequency spikes, along to the FBI. “We’re working closely with the FBI,” John says. Gerry adds, “We gauge it by their interest level in what we’re doing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When they get more enthusiastic,” he continues, before John finishes his thought: “… we know we’re closer and closer to something.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know exactly what the FBI does with the information that the Tedescos submit; one Freedom of Information Act request that I filed on their work was returned with 24 out of 28 total pages redacted in their entirety. A consistent justification was the FOIA statute’s b(7)E exemption, which permits withholding sensitive FBI “techniques and procedures” that could help criminals circumvent the law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, one senior-level law enforcement official, who has worked with the FBI on counterterrorism cases, did tell me that “the FBI is genuinely interested in the Tedescos’ work.” The official, whose current police role bars them from speaking publicly without prior approval, recalls speaking to an FBI agent who “alluded to the help that the Tedescos have been.” But the problem, the official continued, is that “for the relationship to work, it has to be very low-key.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I did briefly manage to get one of the Tedescos’ FBI collaborators on the phone, the agent seemed to confirm their shared efforts, at least tacitly, but asked not to be identified. “As much as I’d like to, we’re kept to pretty strict guidelines,” they said, before alluding to the new Trump administration’s pervasive personnel cuts. “We’re not allowed to talk to media—and with how things are right now, I’m not going to take any risks.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least one former Pentagon intelligence official did offer me some indication that the brothers’ Gabreski airport discoveries were on the right track. “From what I’ve seen, these incidents are just that: drones,” said this source, who requested anonymity as a current defense contractor and to protect their own active FBI sources, including UAP and drone incursion investigators who have consulted the Tedescos. “The origin of many is likely known, and I’d say some are certainly ours.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As to the mystery of why the FBI would even want investigative assistance from two civilians in an RV over partners within the executive branch, it comes down to conflicting priorities—as well as over a dozen or so laws that restrict domestic intelligence collection on drones by either the Pentagon or the US intelligence community. “It’s one of those irreconcilable problems that just doesn’t go away,” says Fred Manget, a former deputy general counsel for the CIA, who watched problems of coordination between agencies persist even after policy changes were implemented post-9/11 to address the situation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The desire of the NSA or some other agency to spy on foreign powers, Manget says, might override the desire to share pertinent information with police—information that could lead to jail time for the drones’ operators. Better to quietly monitor the drones and maybe even give out false data. “Signals intelligence a lot of times can be closed off if the target finds out they’re being surveilled electronically,” Manget says. “There’s things they can do that will end NSA’s ability to collect.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121809" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_FS_524.jpg?w=2784" width="2784" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Tedescos say the straight lines in these anomalous radar readings indicate that something could have been jamming their radar signal.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;On my short call with my FBI source, I did my best to explain this working hypothesis about the Bureau’s collaboration with the Tedescos. “I wouldn’t say that’s wrong,” the source replied. “That’s about as far as I could go.” By this past June, however, even the recent head of the Pentagon’s dedicated UAP-hunting group, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), was admitting publicly that the Defense Department itself has cribbed notes from the Tedescos.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We read their book,” Tim Phillips, AARO’s former acting director, told a UAP podcast, referring to an account of the Nightcrawler project that the Tedescos self-published in 2024. “We thought it was a great plan. We actually looked at the sensors in that book.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On another podcast, Phillips said AARO’s own plan to make its UAP-hunting hardware mobile was borrowed from the brothers. “We thought that was brilliant.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tools for law enforcement&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, partially in a concession to the economic toll their side project has taken, the Tedescos started offering versions of some of their devices for sale on the Nightcrawler’s charmingly GeoCities-esque home page. One of them, a handheld multispectral detector, is effectively the consumer model of that EMF Gatling gun they showed me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic law enforcement is genuinely grasping for solutions like this. Local police in the Natick case, according to one report I obtained via an open records request, were so desperate for any kind of new intel on these unidentified drones that they borrowed a thermal imaging camera from their town’s fire department. But the device, which was not purpose-­built for imaging distant aerial objects, failed to collect anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I broached the idea of law enforcement using something like the Tedescos’ equipment, the answer from police who had witnessed these mystery drones, as well as from scientists, was that further design, product testing, and training would be required first. “I could see it helping law enforcement,” said the AIAA UAP team’s consulting physicist, Rex Groves, “but not without training. Absolutely not. Just like they have to be trained with a radar gun, they’d have to be trained with these other tools.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121811" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_L_450.jpg?w=1375" width="1375" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Gerry naps and John looks at readings from the multispectral camera at about 5 a.m., with the moon and Venus visible overhead.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lauzon, Natick’s deputy chief of police, told me that while he thought equipment like the Tedescos’ “could be useful to identifying a drone, particularly at night,” the real problem is that police “don’t have a lot of authority when it comes to these drones.” Unless they manage to find operators on the ground, Lauzon said, all they can do is report the case, sending it into a black hole at the FAA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Michael Lembeck, an aerospace engineering professor and member of the AIAA team, emphasizes that the worst thing law enforcement can do with these drone incursions right now is nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing anomalies in our airspace and we’re just normalizing that, because it happens so often and nothing bad has happened yet,” Lembeck told me. “Eventually, something is going to come home to roost—and then we’re going to regret the fact that we didn’t look deeper and try to understand what was going on.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew Phelan is a reporter and former chemical engineer based in upstate New York.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a Friday evening last December, every tier of US law enforcement—federal, state, and local—was dispatched to the US Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, a military research installation outside Boston. A squadron of about 15 to 20 drones had been spotted violating the base’s restricted airspace. The culprits could not be found.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One retired major with the Massachusetts State Police, who had been dispatched to help investigate that night, called these unidentified aircraft “the strangest thing he’s ever seen,” according to Brian Lauzon, deputy chief of Natick’s municipal police department. When Lauzon arrived on base later that weekend, he says, he saw drones that were larger than traditional consumer models (most of which are pre-programmed to respect US military airspace these days anyway). By the end of this weekend-long breach, base police not only had called in local law enforcement for backup but were coordinating with the FBI and US Army commanders as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The event, which barely made local news, was only the latest in a series of purported drone sightings along the US East Coast that November and December. Most of these happened in New Jersey, where military police confirmed at least 11 unauthorized drone incursions over an Army research and arms-­manufacturing facility, Picatinny Arsenal. Further sightings, including cases above Donald Trump’s golf course in nearby Bedminster, prompted an FBI investigation and a flurry of new FAA-issued flight bans over sensitive sites, including critical infrastructure. But official answers were less forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tedescos’ roving aerial surveillance unit, which they’ve dubbed “the Nightcrawler,” is an old RV equipped with an array of homemade signals collection equipment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It created a lot of hysteria in the general public,” Lauzon recalls. “I was talking to old ladies who’re telling me that there’s this ship in the ocean that’s launching hundreds of these at a time across the United States.” One Republican congressman from New Jersey did, in fact, claim that a militarized drone ship from Iran had launched the invaders, despite Pentagon denials. Lauzon remembers fielding myriad calls from civilians who had misidentified passenger jets as hostile drones. He recalls attending one presentation by an FBI expert in uncrewed aircraft systems who showed police unhelpful scare videos of improvised drone strikes in Ukraine, in which tiny aircraft rained grenades down on bloodied soldiers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;By late January, the incoming Trump administration would assert that the entirety of the New Jersey drone wave had been benign, with each and every UAS “authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.” Their surety, however, stood in stark contrast to the warnings from top military brass, including the Air Force general at the head of NORAD, Gregory Guillot. In February, he testified to the Senate that approximately 350 drone incursions had been reported over a hundred different US military installations in 2024 alone, stating that many of these cases were unsolved, albeit with “evidence of a foreign intelligence nexus in some of these incidents.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lacking better coordination, or much clarity from the White House, the Pentagon, or the US intelligence community, some in domestic law enforcement—including members of the FBI’s counterintelligence and counterterrorism divisions—have turned to an unlikely source for help cracking the case of these mystery drones: two UFO hunters out on Long Island in New York, John and Gerald Tedesco.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The Tedescos, twin brothers, each spent about three decades in the private sector working in electrical engineering and instrumentation design before they decided to kit out an old RV with an array of homemade signals collection equipment. Their aim was to create a mobile field lab for investigating UFO hot spots. Intrigued by their efforts, members of Harvard’s alien-hunting Galileo Project began talking with the Tedescos in 2021 and asked them to join as research affiliates. Since then, aviation safety advocates, astronomers, physicists and other researchers, and at least one journalist (I, myself) have made the trek out to Long Island’s South Shore to kick the tires on the roving aerial surveillance unit they’ve dubbed “the Nightcrawler.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121806" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_FS_327.jpg?w=2641" width="2641" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;John uses a homemade millimeter-wave radar device.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris Grooms, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran who was a deputy sheriff in Nebraska during an earlier multistate wave of mystery drone sightings from December 2019 to January 2020, gushed when I asked him about the Tedescos: “I don’t know how much you’ve talked to those guys. They’re freaking awesome.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Grooms joined the Tedescos last January, when the brothers publicly shared some of their findings from training the Nightcrawler’s sensors on a few of these unidentified drones. “They do look like commercial air traffic for the most part,” John said during the virtual town hall, moderated by a former Illinois state police lieutenant, “but they also exhibit unexplained or unusual phenomena.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As an example, the Tedescos described some cases they had documented and passed along to law enforcement, in which they caught a mystery drone appearing to go dark to evade closer observation (a common complaint from New Jersey police during the wave). Using their suite of cameras and sensors, which can handle light well outside the visible spectrum, the Tedescos discovered that these craft weren’t so much switching off their lights as switching the frequency of their lights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t actually disappearing,” Gerald (who goes by Gerry) explained. “It was actually changing its spectral signature—it was drifting into an infrared range.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;John likened it to “signature management,” a military term for the ability to tailor anything from radio emissions to light sources so that they remain detectable to one’s allies but undetectable to one’s foes. The clue, which likely would have been lost to police without the Tedescos’ broad range of infrared sensors, was not unlike the kind of citizen-science fieldwork that had gotten them on the radar of academia’s UFO hunters in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why all this attention? As people have repeatedly learned and forgotten ever since airborne enigmas like the flying saucer first entered into the American public consciousness in 1947, simple photos and video are frustratingly inconclusive evidence in isolation. Even heat-sensing infrared footage of UFOs—like those taken by US Navy pilots training off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts—has failed to prove that anything truly unusual is in our skies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What the Tedescos appear to have done, in their effort to bring a fully maximalist approach to the sensors directed at these suspected alien spacecraft, is independently engineer the kind of aerial surveillance capability rarely seen outside the classified world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For domestic law enforcement and the general public, two communities lacking the requisite national security clearances, the Tedescos’ work promises a transparent, open-source solution to the past several years’ worth of bizarre and troubling drone incursions into US airspace. For academics hunting for UFOs and other aerial anomalies, the Tedescos have become informal collaborators and a font of new ideas for novel data collection equipment. But for better or worse, some of the secrets they might be revealing may be the government’s own.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Inside the Nightcrawler&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The term “UFO” has officially gone out of fashion. Nowadays, many policymakers and scientists—and even plenty of old-school “ufologists”—favor the term “unidentified anomalous phenomenon,” or UAP. It’s an intentionally pedantic step backward; an acknowledgment from today’s more disciplined cadre of scientists that a given witness to a strange thing in the sky might not actually be seeing a solid “object,” per se, much less anything “flying” in the strict aerodynamic sense. It could be a poorly understood atmospheric event, like ball lightning, for example; and even if a UAP proves to be an interstellar craft, its propulsion system could involve physics and engineering that render the concept of “flight” quaint.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ryan Graves, a former US Navy lieutenant and F/A-18F fighter pilot who testified before Congress on the safety and security risks that UAPs posed to his own squadron, now heads a committee on the issue for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the nation’s premier society for aerospace engineers. He went out with his AIAA colleagues to see the Nightcrawler in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John drained most of his 401(k) to make the Nightcrawler project a reality, in a five-year labor of love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible what they’ve been able to put together,” Graves says, praising the Tedescos’ ability to collect “very actionable data.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Gerry once held a security clearance to develop reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition sensors for a Pentagon contractor. John has helped conceive and construct analytical test hardware for Underwriters Laboratories, a federally approved safety, testing, and certification firm, and served for a time as the product safety chair for the Long Island branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. John drained most of his 401(k) to make the Nightcrawler project a reality, in a five-year labor of love; Gerry has pitched in what he could. Both men, now sliding through their early 60s, have been fascinated with the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe since their youth ingesting midcentury sci-fi staples like &lt;em&gt;Star Trek, Chiller Theatre&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lost in Space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121804" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_FS_078.jpg?w=2001" width="2001" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A homemade multispectral camera.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got my first tour of their rig during an overnight expedition just off the beach at Robert Moses State Park in Babylon, New York, the weekend before the AIAA’s trip last fall. A klatch of camping chairs and cameras on tripods flanked one side of the Nightcrawler like a tailgate party. Inside, the lived-in kitchenette, the wood paneling, and the hum of over half a dozen monitors—including radar, night-vision, and radio-frequency (RF) scanners—made it feel like the cabin of a cramped marine research vessel.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The RV includes tech that is otherwise hard to find outside defense applications, including RF spectrum analyzers from a firm that specializes in elite anti-drone countermeasures and a UV-C sensor capable of detecting the subtle ultraviolet light emitted when missile plumes and other heat sources turn air into plasma. On the Nightcrawler’s roof, two X-band marine radar systems have been mounted perpendicularly to one another in hopes of collecting three-dimensional radar returns from truly otherworldly UAPs. (“To our knowledge,” as the Tedescos put it in an engineering journal article last year, “no other organizations use active radar for this purpose.”)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Civilians are not ordinarily allowed to beam active radar, owing to federal concerns over “harmful interference” with core systems like air traffic control. But in January 2023, the duo got a rare license from the Federal Communications Commission that permits them to beam radar from Robert Moses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One prototype I saw, a multispectral camera mounted on a sturdy yellow DeWalt surveyor’s tripod, looked like a Gatling gun of multiple cameras and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) sensors. This jerry-rigged device spans the entire visible spectrum and beyond, from deep invisible ultraviolet all the way up to long-wave infrared. They’ve used the UV-C sensor to detect aerial plasmas produced by lightning or those novelty arc-welder cigarette lighters. “We’ve done this as far as a half a mile, but if you had a campfire, they could detect campfires from 28,000 feet,” John told me over the noise coming from the Nightcrawler’s gas-powered electric generator. They’ve also been able to use this device to detect, at least provisionally, telltale UV-C emissions from some weird things off the coast they can’t explain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We had two blue orbs out on the water,” John told me of their UAP cases, “and they triggered it, what, three times?” (“Three times,” Gerry replied.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121810" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_L_234.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Mapping out mile markers on a screen where sightings are compared with commercial air traffic data.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tedescos are pretty bullish on the hypothesis that otherworldly spacecraft might be here—suggesting in their latest journal article, for example, that radar delays they detected near UAPs appear to resemble the bending of electromagnetic waves around black holes. But the implication that the Nightcrawler has caught “gravitational lensing” off some warp-drive craft has rankled a few Galileo Project collaborators. The Harvard-led effort to search for extraterrestrial life or technology within our solar system emphasizes its excruciatingly methodical work of late: calibrating, validating, and recalibrating UAP detection hardware before researchers even try to hunt for true anomalies. Although Galileo scientists have visited and conferred with the Tedescos on UAP-hunting instruments, the brothers’ more rough-and-courtroom-ready “forensic science” approach has caused turbulence in the relationship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In an email, Mitch Randall, a technologist and entrepreneur who has spearheaded Galileo efforts to produce passive radar detectors for UAPs, described the Tedescos’ “gravitational lensing” paper as rife with “too many assumptions.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But he did praise their Nightcrawler as “an ideal tool” for aiding law enforcement. “They could drive around with that and almost chase down drones,” Randall said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;On the hunt&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Tedescos didn’t have to drive the Night­crawler far to train their equipment on a prime mystery drone case: Westhampton Beach’s Francis S. Gabreski Airport, less than an hour from their homes and home itself to the New York Air National Guard’s 106th Rescue Wing, was inundated with at least 28 unauthorized drone flights from late December into January 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are talking about over the airport, over taxiways, over runways,” Suffolk County’s chief deputy sheriff, Chris Brockmeyer, told local news. “That’s a serious safety concern. It’s impacted air operations, and we’re not going to stand for it.” On Christmas Day alone, the airport was besieged by 17 drone incidents, according to the Suffolk County sheriff, who has staff that collaborate informally with the Tedescos. Some of these drones, Suffolk County executive Ed Romaine asserted at a press conference, were “as large as a car.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121803" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_F_027.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Gerry looks through a night-vision scope at the horizon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tedescos couldn’t use their powerful active radar system so close to an airport, so they deployed their handheld millimeter-wave radar, a more sensitive version of the radar guns that police use to catch speeders. Through the cloud cover and the snowfall, the Tedescos said, they were able to track about two or three objects with this device.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But the truly interesting find came from their radio frequency scanners, which detected spikes three times the strength of what they’ve picked up from ordinary hobbyist quadcopters.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I later learned that the two frequencies where those spikes occurred are within a band (1780 to 1850 megahertz) that has been reserved for US government communications. It’s used for military tactical radio relay, precision-guided munitions, drones, and other Defense Department systems, including electronic warfare, software-­defined radio, and tactical targeting networking technology, according to the FCC.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Granted, many portions of this band are devoted to less cloak-and-dagger agencies, like the Department of Agriculture and the Tennessee Valley Authority. But the signals suggested that whatever the Tedescos were tracking above Gabreski Airport, they were likely not from hobbyists. Instead, they might have been from a government project or from something, like an enemy surveillance drone, hoping to pass off its signals as just another heavily siloed “top secret” broadcast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121805" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_FS_240.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Another homemade multispectral camera.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For operations security reasons, we do not provide information on frequencies which our Air National Guard units use,” a spokesperson said via email, adding: “We could not comment on use of the electromagnetic spectrum by other government agencies.” The FCC did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gerry says he and his brother passed their information on this case, including the observations of unusual radio frequency spikes, along to the FBI. “We’re working closely with the FBI,” John says. Gerry adds, “We gauge it by their interest level in what we’re doing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When they get more enthusiastic,” he continues, before John finishes his thought: “… we know we’re closer and closer to something.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know exactly what the FBI does with the information that the Tedescos submit; one Freedom of Information Act request that I filed on their work was returned with 24 out of 28 total pages redacted in their entirety. A consistent justification was the FOIA statute’s b(7)E exemption, which permits withholding sensitive FBI “techniques and procedures” that could help criminals circumvent the law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, one senior-level law enforcement official, who has worked with the FBI on counterterrorism cases, did tell me that “the FBI is genuinely interested in the Tedescos’ work.” The official, whose current police role bars them from speaking publicly without prior approval, recalls speaking to an FBI agent who “alluded to the help that the Tedescos have been.” But the problem, the official continued, is that “for the relationship to work, it has to be very low-key.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I did briefly manage to get one of the Tedescos’ FBI collaborators on the phone, the agent seemed to confirm their shared efforts, at least tacitly, but asked not to be identified. “As much as I’d like to, we’re kept to pretty strict guidelines,” they said, before alluding to the new Trump administration’s pervasive personnel cuts. “We’re not allowed to talk to media—and with how things are right now, I’m not going to take any risks.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least one former Pentagon intelligence official did offer me some indication that the brothers’ Gabreski airport discoveries were on the right track. “From what I’ve seen, these incidents are just that: drones,” said this source, who requested anonymity as a current defense contractor and to protect their own active FBI sources, including UAP and drone incursion investigators who have consulted the Tedescos. “The origin of many is likely known, and I’d say some are certainly ours.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As to the mystery of why the FBI would even want investigative assistance from two civilians in an RV over partners within the executive branch, it comes down to conflicting priorities—as well as over a dozen or so laws that restrict domestic intelligence collection on drones by either the Pentagon or the US intelligence community. “It’s one of those irreconcilable problems that just doesn’t go away,” says Fred Manget, a former deputy general counsel for the CIA, who watched problems of coordination between agencies persist even after policy changes were implemented post-9/11 to address the situation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The desire of the NSA or some other agency to spy on foreign powers, Manget says, might override the desire to share pertinent information with police—information that could lead to jail time for the drones’ operators. Better to quietly monitor the drones and maybe even give out false data. “Signals intelligence a lot of times can be closed off if the target finds out they’re being surveilled electronically,” Manget says. “There’s things they can do that will end NSA’s ability to collect.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121809" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_FS_524.jpg?w=2784" width="2784" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Tedescos say the straight lines in these anomalous radar readings indicate that something could have been jamming their radar signal.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;On my short call with my FBI source, I did my best to explain this working hypothesis about the Bureau’s collaboration with the Tedescos. “I wouldn’t say that’s wrong,” the source replied. “That’s about as far as I could go.” By this past June, however, even the recent head of the Pentagon’s dedicated UAP-hunting group, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), was admitting publicly that the Defense Department itself has cribbed notes from the Tedescos.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We read their book,” Tim Phillips, AARO’s former acting director, told a UAP podcast, referring to an account of the Nightcrawler project that the Tedescos self-published in 2024. “We thought it was a great plan. We actually looked at the sensors in that book.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On another podcast, Phillips said AARO’s own plan to make its UAP-hunting hardware mobile was borrowed from the brothers. “We thought that was brilliant.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tools for law enforcement&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, partially in a concession to the economic toll their side project has taken, the Tedescos started offering versions of some of their devices for sale on the Nightcrawler’s charmingly GeoCities-esque home page. One of them, a handheld multispectral detector, is effectively the consumer model of that EMF Gatling gun they showed me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic law enforcement is genuinely grasping for solutions like this. Local police in the Natick case, according to one report I obtained via an open records request, were so desperate for any kind of new intel on these unidentified drones that they borrowed a thermal imaging camera from their town’s fire department. But the device, which was not purpose-­built for imaging distant aerial objects, failed to collect anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I broached the idea of law enforcement using something like the Tedescos’ equipment, the answer from police who had witnessed these mystery drones, as well as from scientists, was that further design, product testing, and training would be required first. “I could see it helping law enforcement,” said the AIAA UAP team’s consulting physicist, Rex Groves, “but not without training. Absolutely not. Just like they have to be trained with a radar gun, they’d have to be trained with these other tools.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1121811" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250621_MTTR_UAP_SH01_L_450.jpg?w=1375" width="1375" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Gerry naps and John looks at readings from the multispectral camera at about 5 a.m., with the moon and Venus visible overhead.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MARCO GIANNAVOLA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lauzon, Natick’s deputy chief of police, told me that while he thought equipment like the Tedescos’ “could be useful to identifying a drone, particularly at night,” the real problem is that police “don’t have a lot of authority when it comes to these drones.” Unless they manage to find operators on the ground, Lauzon said, all they can do is report the case, sending it into a black hole at the FAA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Michael Lembeck, an aerospace engineering professor and member of the AIAA team, emphasizes that the worst thing law enforcement can do with these drone incursions right now is nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing anomalies in our airspace and we’re just normalizing that, because it happens so often and nothing bad has happened yet,” Lembeck told me. “Eventually, something is going to come home to roost—and then we’re going to regret the fact that we didn’t look deeper and try to understand what was going on.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew Phelan is a reporter and former chemical engineer based in upstate New York.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/26/1121458/ufo-hunters-mystery-drone-invasion/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] The Download: America’s drone brothers, and an upside of AI doomerism (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/26/1122511/the-download-americas-drone-brothers-and-an-upside-of-ai-doomerism/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is today's edition of&amp;nbsp;The Download&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2024 alone, 350 known drone incursions were reported over a hundred different US military installations. A lack of coordination or even clarity from the White House, Pentagon or US intelligence community has led some in domestic law enforcement to turn to an unlikely source for help cracking the case of these mystery drones: two UFO hunters out on Long Island in New York called John and Gerald Tedesco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin brothers each spent about three decades in the private sector working in electrical engineering and instrumentation design before they decided to kit out an old RV with an array of homemade signals collection equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the Tedescos appear to have done, in their effort to bring a maximalist approach to the sensors directed at these suspected alien spacecraft, is independently engineer the kind of aerial surveillance capability rarely seen outside the classified world.

A lack of coordination or even clarity from the White House, Pentagon or US intelligence community has led some in domestic law enforcement to turn to an unlikely source for help cracking the case of these mystery drones: two UFO hunters out on Long Island in New York called John and Gerald Tedesco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin brothers each spent about three decades in the private sector working in electrical engineering and instrumentation design before they decided to kit out an old RV with an array of homemade signals collection equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the Tedescos appear to have done, in their effort to bring a maximalist approach to the sensors directed at these suspected alien spacecraft, is independently engineer the kind of aerial surveillance capability rarely seen outside the classified world.

But it’s no longer just the stuff of fiction. AI doomerism, the idea that this technology—specifically its hypothetical upgrades, artificial general intelligence and super-intelligence—will crash civilizations, even kill us all, is now riding another wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weird thing is that such fears are now driving much-needed action to regulate AI—even if the justification for that action is a bit bonkers.
