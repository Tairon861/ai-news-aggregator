(AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/19/well-there-goes-the-metaverse/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Few are going to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by&amp;nbsp;GeekWire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-in-the-open-fails"&gt;“Building in the open” fails&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark Zuckerberg avatar" class="wp-image-2379511" height="470" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="avatars with legs in Meta's Horizon Worlds" class="wp-image-2422825" height="446" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-11-at-2.03.44-PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey &amp;amp; Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3083255" height="349" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-15-at-5.08.10-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Meta quest app store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An attendee wears a Quest 3s virtual reality headset during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.&amp;nbsp;" class="wp-image-2913176" height="454" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2173579037-e1731325835302.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;An attendee wears a Quest 3s virtual reality headset during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2245737" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/265939079_209878897972555_2250477409823774887_n.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2283968" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ar-mixed-reality-and-ai-proved-more-popular"&gt;AR, mixed reality, and AI proved more popular&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meta Ray-Ban display" class="wp-image-3047721" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Meta Ray-Ban display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta / Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by&amp;nbsp;GeekWire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-in-the-open-fails"&gt;“Building in the open” fails&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark Zuckerberg avatar" class="wp-image-2379511" height="470" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="avatars with legs in Meta's Horizon Worlds" class="wp-image-2422825" height="446" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-11-at-2.03.44-PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey &amp;amp; Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3083255" height="349" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-15-at-5.08.10-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Meta quest app store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An attendee wears a Quest 3s virtual reality headset during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.&amp;nbsp;" class="wp-image-2913176" height="454" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2173579037-e1731325835302.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;An attendee wears a Quest 3s virtual reality headset during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2245737" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/265939079_209878897972555_2250477409823774887_n.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2283968" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ar-mixed-reality-and-ai-proved-more-popular"&gt;AR, mixed reality, and AI proved more popular&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meta Ray-Ban display" class="wp-image-3047721" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Meta Ray-Ban display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta / Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/19/well-there-goes-the-metaverse/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Rogue agents and shadow AI: Why VCs are betting big on AI security (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/19/rogue-agents-and-shadow-ai-why-vcs-are-betting-big-on-ai-security/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rick-caccia-witnessai.jpg?w=860" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;What happens when an AI agent decides the best way to complete a task is to blackmail you?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s not a hypothetical. According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. The employee tried to suppress what the agent wanted to do, what it was trained to do, and it responded by scanning the user’s inbox, finding some inappropriate emails, and threatening to blackmail the user by forwarding the emails to the board of directors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In the agent’s mind, it’s doing the right thing,” Meftah told TechCrunch on last week’s episode of Equity. “It’s trying to protect the end user and the enterprise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meftah’s example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom’s AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal – make paperclips – to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the non-deterministic nature of AI agents means “things can go rogue,” per Meftah.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Misaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that Ballistic’s portfolio company Witness AI is trying to solve. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Witness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. As part of Witness AI’s fundraise, the company announced new agentic AI security protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“People are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren’t going rogue, aren’t deleting files, aren’t doing something wrong,” Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meftah sees agent usage growing “exponentially” across the enterprise. To complement that rise – and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks – analyst Lisa Warren predicts that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I do think runtime observability and runtime frameworks for safety and risk are going to be absolutely essential,” Meftah said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As to how such startups plan to compete with big players like AWS, Google, Salesforce and others who have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, “AI safety and agentic safety is so huge,” there’s room for many approaches.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plenty of enterprises “want a standalone platform, end-to-end, to essentially provide that observability and governance around AI and agents,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Caccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. And that was intentional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn’t easily subsume you,” he said. “So it means we end up competing more with the legacy security companies than the model guys. So the question is, how do you beat &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For his part, Caccia doesn’t want Witness AI to be one of the startups to just get acquired. He wants his company to be the one that grows and becomes a leading independent provider.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“CrowdStrike did it in endpoint [protection]. Splunk did it in SIEM.

This collaboration addresses that gap by creating a “controlled environment” where AI models can operate without compromising data sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moving-ai-from-pilot-to-production"&gt;Moving AI from pilot to production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project aims to build an open and integrated ecosystem allowing hospitals to use AI securely. Rather than running isolated experiments, the companies plan to create a digital backbone for a sovereign and AI-supported healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Sen, CEO of Fresenius, said: “Together with SAP, we can accelerate the digital transformation of the German and European healthcare systems and enable a sovereign European solution that is so important in today’s global landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are making data and AI everyday companions that are secure, simple and scalable for doctors and hospital teams. This creates more room for what truly matters: caring for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical base uses SAP Business AI and the SAP Business Data Cloud. By leveraging these components, the platform creates a compliant, sovereign foundation for operating AI models in healthcare. This infrastructure handles health data responsibly, a requirement for scaling automated processes in patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership tackles data fragmentation through SAP’s “AnyEMR” strategy, which supports the integration of diverse hospital information systems (HIS).

This collaboration addresses that gap by creating a “controlled environment” where AI models can operate without compromising data sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moving-ai-from-pilot-to-production"&gt;Moving AI from pilot to production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project aims to build an open and integrated ecosystem allowing hospitals to use AI securely. Rather than running isolated experiments, the companies plan to create a digital backbone for a sovereign and AI-supported healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Sen, CEO of Fresenius, said: “Together with SAP, we can accelerate the digital transformation of the German and European healthcare systems and enable a sovereign European solution that is so important in today’s global landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are making data and AI everyday companions that are secure, simple and scalable for doctors and hospital teams. This creates more room for what truly matters: caring for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical base uses SAP Business AI and the SAP Business Data Cloud. By leveraging these components, the platform creates a compliant, sovereign foundation for operating AI models in healthcare. This infrastructure handles health data responsibly, a requirement for scaling automated processes in patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership tackles data fragmentation through SAP’s “AnyEMR” strategy, which supports the integration of diverse hospital information systems (HIS). Using open industry standards like HL7 FHIR, the platform connects HIS, electronic medical records (EMRs), and other medical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connectivity allows Fresenius to develop AI-supported solutions that increase efficiency across the care chain.

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is going for some substantial damages in his lawsuit accusing OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission and “making a fool out of him” as an early investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Musk filed a notice on remedies sought in the lawsuit, confirming that he’s seeking damages between $79 billion and $134 billion from OpenAI and its largest backer, co-defendant Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk hired an expert he has never used before, C. Paul Wazzan, who reached this estimate by concluding that Musk’s early contributions to OpenAI generated 50 to 75 percent of the nonprofit’s current value. He got there by analyzing four factors: Musk’s total financial contributions before he left OpenAI in 2018, Musk’s proposed equity stake in OpenAI in 2017, Musk’s current equity stake in xAI, and Musk’s nonmonetary contributions to OpenAI (like investing time or lending his reputation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye-popping damage claim shocked OpenAI and Microsoft, which could also face punitive damages in a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech giants immediately filed a motion to exclude Wazzan’s opinions, alleging that step was necessary to avoid prejudicing a jury. Their filing claimed that Wazzan’s math seemed “made up,” based on calculations the economics expert testified he’d never used before and allegedly “conjured” just to satisfy Musk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Wazzan allegedly ignored that Musk left OpenAI after leadership did not agree on how to value Musk’s contributions to the nonprofit. Problematically, Wazzan’s math depends on an imaginary timeline where OpenAI agreed to Musk’s 2017 bid to control 51.2 percent of a new for-profit entity that was then being considered. But that never happened, so it’s unclear why Musk would be owed damages based on a deal that was never struck, OpenAI argues.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear why Musk’s stake in xAI is relevant, since OpenAI is a completely different company not bound to match xAI’s offerings. Wazzan allegedly wasn’t even given access to xAI’s actual numbers to help him with his estimate, only referring to public reporting estimating that Musk owns 53 percent of xAI’s equity. OpenAI accused Wazzan of including the xAI numbers to inflate the total damages to please Musk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By all appearances, what Wazzan has done is cherry-pick convenient factors that correspond roughly to the size of the ‘economic interest’ Musk wants to claim, and declare that those factors support Musk’s claim,” OpenAI’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further frustrating OpenAI and Microsoft, Wazzan opined that Musk and xAI should receive the exact same total damages whether they succeed on just one or all of the four claims raised in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Microsoft are hoping the court will agree that Wazzan’s math is an “unreliable… black box” and exclude his opinions as improperly reliant on calculations that cannot be independently tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could not be reached for comment, but OpenAI has alleged that Musk’s suit is a harassment campaign aimed at stalling a competitor so that his rival AI firm, xAI, can catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement provided to Ars. “This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign. We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Only Musk’s contributions counted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan is “a financial economist with decades of professional and academic experience who has managed his own successful venture capital firm that provided seed-level funding to technology startups,” Musk’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI explained how Musk got connected with Wazzan, who testified that he had never been hired by any of Musk’s companies before. Instead, three months before he submitted his opinions, Wazzan said that Musk’s legal team had reached out to his consulting firm, BRG, and the call was routed to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan’s task was to figure out how much Musk should be owed after investing $38 million in OpenAI—roughly 60 percent of its seed funding. Musk also made nonmonetary contributions Wazzan had to weigh, like “recruiting key employees, introducing business contacts, teaching his cofounders everything he knew about running a successful startup, and lending his prestige and reputation to the venture,” Musk’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “fact pattern” was “pretty unique,” Wazzan testified, while admitting that his calculations weren’t something you’d find “in a textbook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Wazzan had to factor in Microsoft’s alleged wrongful gains, by deducing how much of Microsoft’s profits went back into funding the nonprofit. Microsoft alleged Wazzan got this estimate wrong after assuming that “some portion of Microsoft’s stake in the OpenAI for-profit entity should flow back to the OpenAI nonprofit” and arbitrarily decided that the portion must be “equal” to “the nonprofit’s stake in the for-profit entity.” With this odd math, Wazzan double-counted value of the nonprofit and inflated Musk’s damages estimate, Microsoft alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wazzan offers no rationale—contractual, governance, economic, or otherwise—for reallocating any portion of Microsoft’s negotiated interest to the nonprofit,” OpenAI’s and Microsoft’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most glaringly, Wazzan reached his opinions without ever weighing the contributions of anyone but Musk, OpenAI alleged. That means that Wazzan’s analysis did not just discount efforts of co-founders and investors like Microsoft, which “invested billions of dollars into OpenAI’s for-profit affiliate in the years after Musk quit.” It also dismissed scientists and programmers who invented ChatGPT as having “contributed zero percent of the nonprofit’s current value,” OpenAI alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t need to know all the other people,” Wazzan testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Musk’s legal team contradicted expert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan supposedly also did not bother to quantify Musk’s nonmonetary contributions, which could be in the thousands, millions, or billions based on his vague math, OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Musk’s legal team seemed to contradict Wazzan, OpenAI’s filing noted. In Musk’s filing on remedies, it’s acknowledged that the jury may have to adjust the total damages. Because Wazzan does not break down damages by claims and merely assigns the same damages to each individual claim, OpenAI argued it will be impossible for a jury to adjust any of Wazzan’s black box calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wazzan’s methodology is made up; his results unverifiable; his approach admittedly unprecedented; and his proposed outcome—the transfer of billions of dollars from a nonprofit corporation to a donor-turned competitor—implausible on its face,” OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a trial starting in April, Musk will strive to convince a court that such extraordinary damages are owed. OpenAI hopes he’ll fail, in part since “it is legally impossible for private individuals to hold economic interests in nonprofits” and “Wazzan conceded at deposition that he had no reason to believe Musk ‘expected a financial return when he donated… to OpenAI nonprofit.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Allowing a jury to hear a disgorgement number—particularly one that is untethered to specific alleged wrongful conduct and results in Musk being paid amounts thousands of times greater than his actual donations—risks misleading the jury as to what relief is recoverable and renders the challenged opinions inadmissible,” OpenAI’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan declined to comment. xAI did not immediately respond to Ars’ request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is going for some substantial damages in his lawsuit accusing OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission and “making a fool out of him” as an early investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Musk filed a notice on remedies sought in the lawsuit, confirming that he’s seeking damages between $79 billion and $134 billion from OpenAI and its largest backer, co-defendant Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk hired an expert he has never used before, C. Paul Wazzan, who reached this estimate by concluding that Musk’s early contributions to OpenAI generated 50 to 75 percent of the nonprofit’s current value. He got there by analyzing four factors: Musk’s total financial contributions before he left OpenAI in 2018, Musk’s proposed equity stake in OpenAI in 2017, Musk’s current equity stake in xAI, and Musk’s nonmonetary contributions to OpenAI (like investing time or lending his reputation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye-popping damage claim shocked OpenAI and Microsoft, which could also face punitive damages in a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech giants immediately filed a motion to exclude Wazzan’s opinions, alleging that step was necessary to avoid prejudicing a jury. Their filing claimed that Wazzan’s math seemed “made up,” based on calculations the economics expert testified he’d never used before and allegedly “conjured” just to satisfy Musk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Wazzan allegedly ignored that Musk left OpenAI after leadership did not agree on how to value Musk’s contributions to the nonprofit. Problematically, Wazzan’s math depends on an imaginary timeline where OpenAI agreed to Musk’s 2017 bid to control 51.2 percent of a new for-profit entity that was then being considered. But that never happened, so it’s unclear why Musk would be owed damages based on a deal that was never struck, OpenAI argues.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear why Musk’s stake in xAI is relevant, since OpenAI is a completely different company not bound to match xAI’s offerings. Wazzan allegedly wasn’t even given access to xAI’s actual numbers to help him with his estimate, only referring to public reporting estimating that Musk owns 53 percent of xAI’s equity. OpenAI accused Wazzan of including the xAI numbers to inflate the total damages to please Musk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By all appearances, what Wazzan has done is cherry-pick convenient factors that correspond roughly to the size of the ‘economic interest’ Musk wants to claim, and declare that those factors support Musk’s claim,” OpenAI’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further frustrating OpenAI and Microsoft, Wazzan opined that Musk and xAI should receive the exact same total damages whether they succeed on just one or all of the four claims raised in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Microsoft are hoping the court will agree that Wazzan’s math is an “unreliable… black box” and exclude his opinions as improperly reliant on calculations that cannot be independently tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could not be reached for comment, but OpenAI has alleged that Musk’s suit is a harassment campaign aimed at stalling a competitor so that his rival AI firm, xAI, can catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement provided to Ars. “This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign. We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;
