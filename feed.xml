Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London. Most of those affected are children under the age of 11. One in five have needed&amp;nbsp;hospital treatment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. &lt;/strong&gt;Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines—the World Health Organization described it as one of the 10 leading threats to global health in 2019. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people will always argue that measles is not a big deal&lt;/strong&gt;—that infections used to be common, and most people survived them and did just fine. It is true that in most cases kids do recover well from the virus. But not always.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms tend to start with a fever and a runny nose. The telltale rash comes later. In some cases, severe complications develop. They can include pneumonia, blindness, and inflammation of the brain. Some people won’t develop complications until years later. In rare cases, the disease can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before the measles vaccine was introduced, in 1963, measles epidemics occurred every two to three years,&amp;nbsp;according to the WHO. Back then, around 2.6 million people died from measles every year. Since it was introduced, the measles vaccine is thought to have prevented almost 59 million deaths.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But vaccination rates have been lagging,&lt;/strong&gt; says Anne Zink, an emergency medicine physician and clinical fellow at the Yale School of Public Health. “We’ve seen a slow decline in people who are willing to get vaccinated against measles for some time,” she says. “As we get more and more people who are at risk because they’re unvaccinated, the higher the chances that the disease can then spread and take off.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates need to be at 95% to prevent measles outbreaks. But rates are well below that level in some regions. Across South Carolina, the proportion of kindergartners who received both doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella, has&amp;nbsp;dropped steadily over the last five years, from 94% in 2020-2021 to 91% in 2024-2025. Some schools in the state have coverage rates as low as 20%, state epidemiologist Linda Bell&amp;nbsp;told reporters last month.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates are low in London, too. Fewer than 70% of children have received both doses of their MMR by the time they turn five, according to&amp;nbsp;the UK Health Security Agency. In some boroughs, vaccination rates are as low as 58%. So perhaps it’s not surprising we’re seeing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The UK is one of six countries to have&amp;nbsp;lost their measles elimination status last month, along with Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. Canada&amp;nbsp;lost its elimination status last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The highly contagious measles could be a bellwether for other vaccine-preventable diseases. Zink is already seeing signs. She points to a case of&amp;nbsp;polio that paralyzed a man in New York in 2022. That happened when rates of polio vaccination were low, she says. “Polio is a great example of … a disease that is primarily asymptomatic, and most people don’t have any symptoms whatsoever, but for the people who do get symptoms, it can be life-threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then there’s mumps&lt;/strong&gt;—another disease the MMR vaccine protects against. It’s another one of those infections that can be symptom-free and harmless in some, especially children, but nasty for others. It can cause a painful swelling of the testes, and other complications include brain swelling and deafness. (From my personal experience of being hospitalized with mumps, I can attest that even “mild” infections are pretty horrible.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mumps is less contagious than measles, so we might expect a delay between an uptick in measles cases and the spread of mumps, says Zink. &lt;strong&gt;But she says that she’s more concerned about hepatitis B.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It lives on surfaces for a long period of time, and if you’re not vaccinated against it and you’re exposed to it as a kid, you’re at a really high risk of developing liver cancer and death,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Zink was formerly chief medical officer of Alaska, a state that in the 1970s had the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. Screening and universal newborn vaccination programs&amp;nbsp;eliminated the virus’s spread.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Public health experts worry that the current US administration’s position on vaccines may contribute to the decline in vaccine uptake. Last month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved&amp;nbsp;changes to childhood vaccination recommendations. The agency no longer recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. The chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel has also&amp;nbsp;questioned broad vaccine recommendations for polio.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even vitamin injections are being refused by parents, says Zink. A shot of vitamin K at birth can help prevent severe bleeding in some babies. But&amp;nbsp;recent research suggests that parents of 5% of newborns are refusing it (up from 2.9% in 2017).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I can’t tell you how many of my pediatric [doctor] friends have told me about having to care for a kiddo in the ICU with … bleeding into their brain because the kid didn’t get vitamin K at birth,” says Zink. “And that can kill kids, [or have] lifelong, devastating, stroke-like symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All this paints a pretty bleak picture for children’s health.&lt;/strong&gt; But things can change. Vaccination can still offer protection to plenty of people at risk of infection. South Carolina’s Department of Public Health is offering&amp;nbsp;free MMR vaccinations to residents at mobile clinics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s easy to think ‘It’s not going to be me,’” says Zink. “Seeing kiddos who don’t have the agency to make decisions [about vaccination] being so sick from vaccine-preventable diseases, to me, is one of the most challenging things of practicing medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

According to Mi-3, the company is changing its focus from “price to persuasion,” with digital platforms, AI, and in-store execution becoming increasingly important in building demand. This reflects a change in consumer brand behaviour as inflation pressures ease and companies seek new strategies to maintain revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means expanding the role of AI in Coca-Cola’s marketing production and decision-making. The company has already experimented with generative AI in creative campaigns and continues testing how automation can help with content creation, campaign planning, and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysis from The Current points out that Coca-Cola has been embedding AI into marketing workflows and scaling its use in creative production and campaign execution. These efforts include using AI tools to generate images, assist with storytelling, and adjust campaigns in channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Testing AI in the marketing pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week’s reporting suggests the company is now testing AI-driven systems that can help automate parts of the advertising process, including drafting scripts or preparing social media content. While these initiatives remain in testing not full rollout, they illustrate how large brands are moving toward more automated marketing pipelines. Instead of relying only on agencies or long creative cycles, companies are exploring ways to shorten the path from concept to campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the past two years, many consumer goods have firms relied on price increases to offset rising costs. As inflation slows in several markets, analysts say that strategy has limits. Growth increasingly depends on persuading consumers to buy more often or choose higher-margin products. AI offers a way to refine that persuasion at scale, using data to shape messages, target audiences, and adjust campaigns in near real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola’s approach fits a wider trend in marketing technology. Generative AI tools have quickly moved from experimental use to regular deployment in large enterprises. According to McKinsey’s 2024 global AI survey, about one-third of organisations already use generative AI in at least one business function, with marketing and sales among the most common areas of adoption. Analysts expect that share to keep rising as companies test automation in creative work and customer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI moves upstream in enterprise strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strikes out in Coca-Cola’s case is how the corporation frames AI not only as a cost-saving tool, but also as part of a broader operating shift. By focusing on persuasion, the company signals that AI’s value lies in shaping demand, not improving efficiency. That includes using AI to analyse consumer behaviour, tailor messaging to different markets, and support local teams with adaptable content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy also reflects a growing tension in the marketing sector. Automation can speed up production and test more campaign ideas, but it also raises questions about creative quality, brand consistency, and the role of human teams. Companies experimenting with AI-generated content must still ensure that messaging aligns with their brand identity and cultural context. For global brands like Coca-Cola, that challenge becomes more complex because campaigns frequently need to work in many regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor shaping this transition is the rapid growth of digital advertising channels. As spending shifts toward social platforms, streaming services, and online retail media, the volume of content required has expanded. AI tools offer a way to produce many versions of ads, test different approaches, and adjust messaging based on performance data. This makes automation appealing not only for cost reasons, but also for speed and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola’s move reflects a broader pattern: AI adoption is moving upstream in business processes. Early deployments frequently centred on analytics or internal automation. Companies are now applying AI in customer-facing functions like marketing strategy, creative development, and campaign management. That change suggests that AI is becoming part of how companies compete for market share, not how they reduce expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm has not indicated that AI will replace creative teams or agencies. Instead, the current direction indicates a hybrid model in which automation handles repetitive or data-heavy tasks while human teams guide brand voice and campaign concepts. Many marketing leaders believe that this blended approach will define the next phase of AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola’s emphasis on persuasion over pricing may impact how other consumer brands approach growth in a post-inflation environment. If AI can assist businesses in more precisely shaping demand, it may minimise reliance on price increases or mass-market campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by James Yarema)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: PepsiCo is using AI to rethink how factories are designed and updated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Analysts expect that share to keep rising as companies test automation in creative work and customer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI moves upstream in enterprise strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strikes out in Coca-Cola’s case is how the corporation frames AI not only as a cost-saving tool, but also as part of a broader operating shift. By focusing on persuasion, the company signals that AI’s value lies in shaping demand, not improving efficiency. That includes using AI to analyse consumer behaviour, tailor messaging to different markets, and support local teams with adaptable content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy also reflects a growing tension in the marketing sector. Automation can speed up production and test more campaign ideas, but it also raises questions about creative quality, brand consistency, and the role of human teams. Companies experimenting with AI-generated content must still ensure that messaging aligns with their brand identity and cultural context. For global brands like Coca-Cola, that challenge becomes more complex because campaigns frequently need to work in many regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor shaping this transition is the rapid growth of digital advertising channels. As spending shifts toward social platforms, streaming services, and online retail media, the volume of content required has expanded. AI tools offer a way to produce many versions of ads, test different approaches, and adjust messaging based on performance data. This makes automation appealing not only for cost reasons, but also for speed and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola’s move reflects a broader pattern: AI adoption is moving upstream in business processes. Early deployments frequently centred on analytics or internal automation. Companies are now applying AI in customer-facing functions like marketing strategy, creative development, and campaign management. That change suggests that AI is becoming part of how companies compete for market share, not how they reduce expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm has not indicated that AI will replace creative teams or agencies. Instead, the current direction indicates a hybrid model in which automation handles repetitive or data-heavy tasks while human teams guide brand voice and campaign concepts. Many marketing leaders believe that this blended approach will define the next phase of AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola’s emphasis on persuasion over pricing may impact how other consumer brands approach growth in a post-inflation environment. If AI can assist businesses in more precisely shaping demand, it may minimise reliance on price increases or mass-market campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by James Yarema)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: PepsiCo is using AI to rethink how factories are designed and updated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Across nearly 6,000 verified executives in four countries, AI has delivered modest aggregate shifts in productivity or employment over the past three years. The measured impact reflects the early phases of deployment rather than a failure of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The working paper [PDF], published by the National Bureau of Economic Research and produced by teams from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the Bank of England, the Deutsche Bundesbank and Macquarie University, found that over 90% of firms report no measurable change headcount attributable to AI over the past three years. Given the short time horizon and the concentration of AI use in discrete functions, such incremental rather than transformative effects are consistent with how general purpose technologies have evolved historically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption of AI is widespread. Around 69% of firms are already using some form of AI, led by LLM-based text generation at 41%, data processing via machine learning at 28% and visual content creation at 29%. In the UK, firm-level adoption rose from 61% to 71% across 2025. AI tools are embedded in day-to-day workflows, and although measured impact at firm level often lags adoption, the trend is generally upwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-forward-ai-impact-numbers-indicate-acceleration"&gt;The forward AI impact numbers indicate acceleration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives expect stronger effects to take place over the next three years. On average, they expect a 1.4% increase in productivity and a 0.8% rise in output. US executives project a 2.25% productivity gain, while UK firms expect 1.86%. In economies that have struggled with weak productivity growth for over a decade, gains of that magnitude are notable – incremental improvements, compounded across sectors, shift national outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the thorny subject of employment, executives expect a modest 0.7% reduction in headcount across the four countries over the same period. In the UK, around two-thirds of this adjustment is expected to come through slower hiring rather than outright redundancies. That pattern suggests a gradual reallocation of roles rather than abrupt terminations. As with previous waves of automation, aggregate figures do not capture job creation in adjacent roles, and in the case of AI, these might include roles around data governance, model oversight, prompt engineering, and AI-enabled service development, many of which would be new roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interpreting-the-expectation-gap"&gt;Interpreting the expectation gap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also compares executive expectations with those of workers. Researchers fielded parallel questions to US employees through the Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes. Employees expect AI to increase employment at their firms by 0.5% over the next three years, while US executives expect a 1.2% reduction. Employees foresee productivity gains of 0.92%, below the executive forecast of 2.25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This divergence reflects different vantage points. Executives observe cost structures and competitive pressure, while employees experience task-level augmentation and new capabilities. In practice, AI systems are often deployed to assist rather than replace, particularly in knowledge-intensive work. Evidence from controlled trials, including large language model use in customer support and professional services, shows productivity gains concentrated among less experienced staff, with quality improvements appearing alongside better output figures. Where communication and training are clear, adoption tends to proceed with limited resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-ai-impact-data-merits-attention"&gt;Why this AI impact data merits attention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survey design influences inferences from any statistics, and in this particular case, the researchers noted variation between their own figures and those from, for example, a McKinsey survey taken in the same period that put adoption at 88% of organisations (the survey in question here pegs the figure at just 69%). On the other hand, the US Census Business Trends and Outlook Survey, which draws on a broader respondent base, estimated AI use at around 9% in early 2024, rising to 18% by December 2025. This gap reflects differences in sampling, question framing and respondent seniority. Executive surveys tend to capture intent and enterprise-level deployments, while broader business surveys may reflect narrower definitions of AI or earlier stages of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study in question, respondents were phone-verified, unpaid, and predominantly CEOs and CFOs, with over 90% drawn from the UK and Germany. The data was cross-checked against ten years of macro output and employment figures from national statistics agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inflection point executives anticipate may unfold over the next three years as deployments mature and integration improves, in the way that many new technologies have emerged into the workplace until they become everyday tools. The central question is less whether AI will affect productivity and employment, and more how quickly organisations can change the technology’s wider adoption into measurable economic gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s enterprise push: The hidden story behind AI’s sales race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Second, that this will be the very last time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They’re called corpse doves—because the darkest part of their gray plumage surrounds the lighter part, giving the impression that skeleton faces are peeking out from behind trash cans and bushes—and their crime is having the ability to carry diseases that would be compatible with humans. I open my hand, triggering the display from my imprinted handheld, and record an image to verify the elimination. A ding from my palm lets me know I’ve reached my quota for the day and, with that, the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m tempted to give this one a send-off, a real burial with holy words and some flowers, but then I hear a pack of streetrats hooting beside me. My city-issued vest is reflective and nanopainted so it projects a slight glow. I don’t know if it’s to keep us safe like they say, or if it’s just that so many of us are ex-cons working court-ordered labor, and civilians want to be able to keep an eye on us. Either way, everyone treats us like we’re invisible—everyone except children.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I switch the lasernet on the bird from &lt;em&gt;electrocute &lt;/em&gt;to &lt;em&gt;incinerate&lt;/em&gt; and watch as what already looked like a corpse becomes ashes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey, executioner!” says a girl.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Executioner” is not my official title. The branch of city government we work for is called the Department of Mercy, and we’re only ever called technicians. But that doesn’t matter to the child, who can’t be more than eight but has the authority of a judge as she holds up a finger to point me out to her friends.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="bird talon" class="wp-image-1132712" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-200515070_body.jpg?w=1651" width="1651" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;HENRY HORENSTEIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Guys, look!” she says, then turns her attention to me. “You hunting something big?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I shake my head, slowly packing up my things.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Something small?” she asks. Then her eyes darken. “You’re not a cat killer, are you?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No,” I say quickly. “I do horseflies.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know why I lied, but as the suspicion leaves her face and a smile returns, I’m glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You should come down by the docks. We’ve got flies! Make your quota in a day.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The girl tosses her hair, making the tinfoil charms she’s wrapped around her braids tinkle like wind chimes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s my last day. But if I get flies again for next year, I’ll swing by.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another lie, because we both know the city would never send anyone to the docks for flies. Flies are killed because they are a nuisance, which means people only care about clearing them out of suburbs and financial districts. They’d only send a tech down to the docks to kill something that put the city proper at risk through disease, or by using up more resources than they wanted to spare.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LeeLee is expecting me home to sit through the reassignments with her and it’s already late, so I hand out a couple of the combination warming and light sticks I get for winter to the pack of children with nowhere to go. As I walk away, the children are laughing so loud it sounds like screaming. They toss the sticks in the air like signal flares, small bright cries for help that no one will see.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LeeLee’s anxiety takes the form of caretaking, and as soon as I’ve stepped through the door I can smell bread warming and soup on the stove. I take off my muffling boots. Another day, I’d leave them on and sneak up on her just to be irritating, and she’d turn and threaten me with whatever kitchen utensil was at hand. But she’ll be extra nervous today, so I remove the shoes that let me catch nervous birds, and step hard on my way in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems impossible that I can spend a year killing every fragile and defenseless thing I’ve encountered but still take such care with Lee. But I tell myself that the killing isn’t me—it’s just my sentence, and what I do when I have a choice is the only thing that really says anything about me. For the first six months and 400 birds, I believed it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;LeeLee flicks on a smile that lasts a whole three seconds when she sees me, then clouds over again.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Soup’s too thin. There wasn’t enough powder for a real broth.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I like thin soup,” I say.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Not like this. It doesn’t even cover up the taste of the water.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I like the taste of the water,” I say, which breaks her out of her spiraling enough to roll her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I put my hands on her shoulder to stop her fussing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“The soup is going to be fine,” I say. “So will the reassignment.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I’m not much taller than she is, but when we met in juvie she hadn’t hit her last growth spurt yet, so she still tilts her head back to look me in the eyes. “What if it’s not?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It will—”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What if you get whatever assignment Jordan got?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There it is. Because two of us didn’t leave juvie together to start community service—three of us did. But Jordan didn’t last three weeks into his assignment before he turned his implements inward.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I notice she doesn’t say &lt;em&gt;What if  &lt;/em&gt;I &lt;em&gt;get what Jordan got?&lt;/em&gt; Because LeeLee is more afraid of being left alone than of having to kill something innocent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t know what his assignment was,” I say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s true, but we do know it was bad. Two weeks into our first stretch, a drug meant to sterilize the city’s feral cat population accidentally had the opposite effect. Everyone was pulled off their assigned duty for three days to murder litters of new kittens instead. It nearly broke me and Lee, but Jordan seemed almost grateful.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Besides, we don’t know if his assignment had anything to do with … what he did. You’re borrowing trouble. Worry in”—I check my palm—“an hour, when you actually know there’s something to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You’d think it would hover over us too insistently to be ignored, but after we sit down and talk about our day I’m at ease, basking in the warmth of her storytelling and the bread that’s more beige than gray today. When the notification comes in, I am well and truly happy, and I can only hope it isn’t for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We both stiffen when we hear the alert. She looks at me, and I give her a smile and a nod, and then we look down. In the time between hearing the notification and checking it, I imagine all kinds of horrors that could be in my assignment slot. I imagine a picture of kittens, reason enough for the girl I met earlier to condemn me. For a moment, just a flash, I imagine looking down and seeing my own face as my target, or LeeLee’s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But when I finally see the file, the relief that comes over me softens my spine. It’s a plant. Faceless, and bloodless.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I look up, and LeeLee’s eyes are dark as she leans forward, studying my face, looking for whatever crack she failed to see in Jordan. I force myself to smile wide for her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s a plant. I got a plant, Lee.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She reaches forward and squeezes my hands. Hers are shaking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What did you get?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;She waves away my question. “I got rats. I can handle it. I was just worried about you.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I spend the rest of the night unbelievably happy. For the next year, I get to kill a thing that does not scream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You get all that?” the man behind the desk asks, and I nod even though I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’ve traded in my boots and lasernet for a hazmat suit and a handheld mister with two different solutions. The man had been talking to me about how to use the solutions, but I can’t process verbal information very well. The whole reason I was sent to the correctional facility as a teen was that too many teachers mistook my processing delays for behavioral infractions. I’m planning to read the manual on my own time before I start in a few hours, but when I pick up the mister and look down the barrel, the equipment guy freaks out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Did you not hear me? Don’t even look at that thing without your mask on.” He takes a breath, calmer now that I’ve lowered my hands. “Look, the first solution—it’s fine. It’s keyed to the plant itself and just opens its cells up for whatever solution we put on it. You could drink the stuff. But that second? The orange vial? Don’t even put it in the mister without your mask on. It dissipates quickly, so you’re good once you’re done spraying, but not a second before.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He looks around, then leans in. “They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I nod again as I grab the mask I hadn’t noticed before. This time when I thank him, I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It takes me an hour to find the first plant, and when I do&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;it’s beautiful. Lush pink on the inside and dark green on the outside, it looks hearty and primitive. Almost Jurassic. I can see why it’s only in the sewers now: it would be too easy to spot and destroy aboveground in the sea of concrete.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After putting on my mask, I activate the mister and then stand back as it sprays the plant with poison. Nothing happens. I remember the prepping solution and switch the cartridges to coat it in that first. The next time I try the poison, the plant wilts instantly, browning and shrinking like a tire deflating. I was wrong. Plants this size don’t die silently. It makes a wheezing sound, a deep sigh. By the third time I’ve heard it, I swear I can make out the word &lt;em&gt;Please&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="sprout" class="wp-image-1132697" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-531112658.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;HENRY HORENSTEIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I get home, LeeLee’s locked herself in the bathroom, which doesn’t surprise me. I heard that they moved to acid for rats, and the smell of a corpse dissolving is impossible to get used to and even harder to get out of your hair. I eat dinner, read, change for bed, and she’s still in the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The next morning, I have to take a transport to the plant’s habitat on the other end of the city, so I spend the time looking through the file that came with the assignment. Under “Characteristics,” some city government scientist has written, “Large, dark. Resource-intensive. Stubborn.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I stare at the last word. Its own sentence, tacked on like an afterthought. &lt;em&gt;Stubborn.&lt;/em&gt; The same word that was written in my file when I got sent from school to the facility where I met LeeLee and Jordan. Large, dark, stubborn, and condemned. I’ve never been called &lt;em&gt;resource-intensive&lt;/em&gt;. But I have been called a waste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And maybe that’s why I do it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I get to my last plant of the day, I don’t reach for the mister. This one is small, young, the green still neon-bright and the teeth at the edges still soft. I pick it up, careful with its roots, and carry it home. I find a discarded water container along the way and place it inside. When I get home I knock on LeeLee’s door. She doesn’t answer, so I leave the plant on the floor as an offering. They aren’t proper flowers, but they smell nice and earthy. It might keep the residual odor from melted organs, fur, and bones from taking over her room.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Killing things is a dumb job,” says the girl.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After a week of hearing the death cries of its cousins, I was moved to use some of my allowance to buy cheap fertilizer and growth serum for my plant. The girl and her friends, fewer than before, were panhandling at the megastore across the way. She ran over, braids jingling, as soon as she saw me. I thought she’d leave once I gave her more glowsticks for her friends, but she stayed in step and kept following me.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It’s not a dumb job,” I say, even though it is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What’s the point?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I shift my bag to point at the bottom of my vest. Beneath “Mercy Dept.” the department’s slogan is written in cursive: &lt;em&gt;Killing to Save!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“See?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;She sees the text but doesn’t register it, and I have to remind myself that even getting kicked out of school is a privilege. The city had decided to stop wasting educational resources on me. They’d never even tried with her or the other streetrats.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It just means we kill to help.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That doesn’t make sense.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, all I can think about is Jordan. “Maybe they don’t mind.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think of the plants. Maybe they hadn’t been pleading. Maybe they’d been sighing with relief. I think of the birds that eventually stopped running away.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Maybe they’re tired. The city’s right, and their existence isn’t compatible with the world we made. And that’s our fault for being stupid and cruel, but it makes their lives so hard. We’ve made it so they can only live half a life. Maybe the least we can do is finish the job.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a terrible thing to say—even worse to a kid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her eyes go hard. “What are you killing now, executioner?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question surprises me. “Sewer plants. Why?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe you.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d wanted her to leave me alone, but when she runs away I feel suddenly empty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have an issue at work when I can’t find my poison vial.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I tell them it rolled away in the sewer and I couldn’t catch it in time, because I don’t want to tell them I was unobservant enough to let a street kid steal from me. After a stern warning and a mountain of forms, they issue a new vial and don’t add to my service time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_30"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pulling overtime to make up for the day I didn’t have my poison means it’s days before I get to fertilize my houseplant. LeeLee’s door is open, so I bring in the fertilizer and serum. She’s put the plant on her windowsill, but it prefers indirect sunlight, so I move it to the shelf next to her boxes of knickknacks and trinkets. I add the fertilizer to its soil and am about to spray it with the growth serum when I get an idea. I get the mister from my kit and set it up to spray the prepping solution on the little plant to prime it. I open the window and put on my mask, just in case, but I’m sure the man was telling the truth when he called the first liquid harmless. After its cells are open, I spray it with my store-bought growth serum.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m halfway through making dinner when I hear the crash and run into LeeLee’s room.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Shit!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_32"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plant has grown huge, turning adult instantly, and its new weight has taken down LeeLee’s shelf. Dainty keepsake boxes are shattered on our concrete floor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I bend to my knees quickly, so focused on fixing my mistake that I don’t register the oddness of the items I’m picking up—jacks, kids’ toys, a bow—until my fingers touch something small and shimmering. It’s a scrap of silver, still rounded in the shape of the braids it was taken from.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I got rats. I can handle it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d forgotten the city has more than one kind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m waiting up when Lee gets home. I don’t make her tell me. I just grab her kit and rummage through it. Where my kit has a hazmat suit, hers has a stealth mesh to render her invisible. Where I keep my mister, she has a gun loaded with vials too large for rats. I have a mini-vac to suck up excess plant matter to prevent seeds from sprouting. She has zip ties.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the time I’m done, she’s already cracking under the weight of everything she tried to protect me from. Within moments she’s sobbing on the floor. I carry her to her bed and get in beside her. I try not to listen too closely as she recounts every horrible moment, but I’m listening at the end, when she tells me she can’t do it anymore. When she confesses that she’s the one who stole my poison, and has only been waiting to take it because she didn’t have the stomach to do to me what Jordan did to us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_34"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I leave her for just a moment, but by the time I lie back in bed beside her I’ve figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I tell her that she won’t have to take her shift tomorrow. I tell her I’m going to go around the city with my mister and my growth serum. That I’ll move plants from sewers to the yards around City Hall and every public space and the support pylons of important people’s companies, and then spray them so they become huge. The city will freak. I tell her it will be like the kittens, but this time we’ll all be pulled off our assignments to kill plants. And maybe the serum will work too well. Maybe the city was right to fear these plants, and they will grow and grow and eat our concrete while the roots crack our foundations and cut our electricity and everything will crumble. And the people with something to lose might suffer, but the rest of us will just laugh at the perfection of rubble. I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_36"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She asks if I’ll put any at our old detention center.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I tell her, &lt;em&gt;Hundreds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I talk long enough that her eyes close, and loud enough that neither of us can hear the sound of my mister blowing. The man who gave it to me was right. Even without the mask, it doesn’t smell like sulfur. It doesn’t smell like anything.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Micaiah Johnson’s debut novel,&lt;/em&gt; The Space Between Worlds&lt;em&gt;, a &lt;/em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;em&gt; bestseller and &lt;/em&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; Editors’ Choice pick, was named one of the best books of 2020 and one of the best science fiction books of the last decade by NPR.

Second, that this will be the very last time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They’re called corpse doves—because the darkest part of their gray plumage surrounds the lighter part, giving the impression that skeleton faces are peeking out from behind trash cans and bushes—and their crime is having the ability to carry diseases that would be compatible with humans. I open my hand, triggering the display from my imprinted handheld, and record an image to verify the elimination. A ding from my palm lets me know I’ve reached my quota for the day and, with that, the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m tempted to give this one a send-off, a real burial with holy words and some flowers, but then I hear a pack of streetrats hooting beside me. My city-issued vest is reflective and nanopainted so it projects a slight glow. I don’t know if it’s to keep us safe like they say, or if it’s just that so many of us are ex-cons working court-ordered labor, and civilians want to be able to keep an eye on us. Either way, everyone treats us like we’re invisible—everyone except children.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I switch the lasernet on the bird from &lt;em&gt;electrocute &lt;/em&gt;to &lt;em&gt;incinerate&lt;/em&gt; and watch as what already looked like a corpse becomes ashes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey, executioner!” says a girl.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Executioner” is not my official title. The branch of city government we work for is called the Department of Mercy, and we’re only ever called technicians. But that doesn’t matter to the child, who can’t be more than eight but has the authority of a judge as she holds up a finger to point me out to her friends.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="bird talon" class="wp-image-1132712" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-200515070_body.jpg?w=1651" width="1651" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;HENRY HORENSTEIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Guys, look!” she says, then turns her attention to me. “You hunting something big?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I shake my head, slowly packing up my things.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Something small?” she asks. Then her eyes darken. “You’re not a cat killer, are you?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No,” I say quickly. “I do horseflies.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know why I lied, but as the suspicion leaves her face and a smile returns, I’m glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You should come down by the docks. We’ve got flies! Make your quota in a day.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The girl tosses her hair, making the tinfoil charms she’s wrapped around her braids tinkle like wind chimes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s my last day. But if I get flies again for next year, I’ll swing by.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another lie, because we both know the city would never send anyone to the docks for flies. Flies are killed because they are a nuisance, which means people only care about clearing them out of suburbs and financial districts. They’d only send a tech down to the docks to kill something that put the city proper at risk through disease, or by using up more resources than they wanted to spare.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LeeLee is expecting me home to sit through the reassignments with her and it’s already late, so I hand out a couple of the combination warming and light sticks I get for winter to the pack of children with nowhere to go. As I walk away, the children are laughing so loud it sounds like screaming. They toss the sticks in the air like signal flares, small bright cries for help that no one will see.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LeeLee’s anxiety takes the form of caretaking, and as soon as I’ve stepped through the door I can smell bread warming and soup on the stove. I take off my muffling boots. Another day, I’d leave them on and sneak up on her just to be irritating, and she’d turn and threaten me with whatever kitchen utensil was at hand. But she’ll be extra nervous today, so I remove the shoes that let me catch nervous birds, and step hard on my way in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems impossible that I can spend a year killing every fragile and defenseless thing I’ve encountered but still take such care with Lee. But I tell myself that the killing isn’t me—it’s just my sentence, and what I do when I have a choice is the only thing that really says anything about me. For the first six months and 400 birds, I believed it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;LeeLee flicks on a smile that lasts a whole three seconds when she sees me, then clouds over again.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Soup’s too thin. There wasn’t enough powder for a real broth.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I like thin soup,” I say.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Not like this. It doesn’t even cover up the taste of the water.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I like the taste of the water,” I say, which breaks her out of her spiraling enough to roll her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I put my hands on her shoulder to stop her fussing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“The soup is going to be fine,” I say. “So will the reassignment.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I’m not much taller than she is, but when we met in juvie she hadn’t hit her last growth spurt yet, so she still tilts her head back to look me in the eyes. “What if it’s not?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It will—”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What if you get whatever assignment Jordan got?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There it is. Because two of us didn’t leave juvie together to start community service—three of us did. But Jordan didn’t last three weeks into his assignment before he turned his implements inward.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I notice she doesn’t say &lt;em&gt;What if  &lt;/em&gt;I &lt;em&gt;get what Jordan got?&lt;/em&gt; Because LeeLee is more afraid of being left alone than of having to kill something innocent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t know what his assignment was,” I say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s true, but we do know it was bad. Two weeks into our first stretch, a drug meant to sterilize the city’s feral cat population accidentally had the opposite effect. Everyone was pulled off their assigned duty for three days to murder litters of new kittens instead. It nearly broke me and Lee, but Jordan seemed almost grateful.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Besides, we don’t know if his assignment had anything to do with … what he did. You’re borrowing trouble. Worry in”—I check my palm—“an hour, when you actually know there’s something to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You’d think it would hover over us too insistently to be ignored, but after we sit down and talk about our day I’m at ease, basking in the warmth of her storytelling and the bread that’s more beige than gray today. When the notification comes in, I am well and truly happy, and I can only hope it isn’t for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We both stiffen when we hear the alert. She looks at me, and I give her a smile and a nod, and then we look down. In the time between hearing the notification and checking it, I imagine all kinds of horrors that could be in my assignment slot. I imagine a picture of kittens, reason enough for the girl I met earlier to condemn me. For a moment, just a flash, I imagine looking down and seeing my own face as my target, or LeeLee’s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But when I finally see the file, the relief that comes over me softens my spine. It’s a plant. Faceless, and bloodless.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I look up, and LeeLee’s eyes are dark as she leans forward, studying my face, looking for whatever crack she failed to see in Jordan. I force myself to smile wide for her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s a plant. I got a plant, Lee.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She reaches forward and squeezes my hands. Hers are shaking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What did you get?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;She waves away my question. “I got rats. I can handle it. I was just worried about you.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I spend the rest of the night unbelievably happy. For the next year, I get to kill a thing that does not scream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You get all that?” the man behind the desk asks, and I nod even though I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’ve traded in my boots and lasernet for a hazmat suit and a handheld mister with two different solutions. The man had been talking to me about how to use the solutions, but I can’t process verbal information very well. The whole reason I was sent to the correctional facility as a teen was that too many teachers mistook my processing delays for behavioral infractions. I’m planning to read the manual on my own time before I start in a few hours, but when I pick up the mister and look down the barrel, the equipment guy freaks out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Did you not hear me? Don’t even look at that thing without your mask on.” He takes a breath, calmer now that I’ve lowered my hands. “Look, the first solution—it’s fine. It’s keyed to the plant itself and just opens its cells up for whatever solution we put on it. You could drink the stuff. But that second? The orange vial? Don’t even put it in the mister without your mask on. It dissipates quickly, so you’re good once you’re done spraying, but not a second before.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He looks around, then leans in. “They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I nod again as I grab the mask I hadn’t noticed before. This time when I thank him, I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It takes me an hour to find the first plant, and when I do&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;it’s beautiful. Lush pink on the inside and dark green on the outside, it looks hearty and primitive. Almost Jurassic. I can see why it’s only in the sewers now: it would be too easy to spot and destroy aboveground in the sea of concrete.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After putting on my mask, I activate the mister and then stand back as it sprays the plant with poison. Nothing happens. I remember the prepping solution and switch the cartridges to coat it in that first. The next time I try the poison, the plant wilts instantly, browning and shrinking like a tire deflating. I was wrong. Plants this size don’t die silently. It makes a wheezing sound, a deep sigh. By the third time I’ve heard it, I swear I can make out the word &lt;em&gt;Please&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="sprout" class="wp-image-1132697" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-531112658.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;HENRY HORENSTEIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I get home, LeeLee’s locked herself in the bathroom, which doesn’t surprise me. I heard that they moved to acid for rats, and the smell of a corpse dissolving is impossible to get used to and even harder to get out of your hair. I eat dinner, read, change for bed, and she’s still in the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The next morning, I have to take a transport to the plant’s habitat on the other end of the city, so I spend the time looking through the file that came with the assignment. Under “Characteristics,” some city government scientist has written, “Large, dark. Resource-intensive. Stubborn.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I stare at the last word. Its own sentence, tacked on like an afterthought. &lt;em&gt;Stubborn.&lt;/em&gt; The same word that was written in my file when I got sent from school to the facility where I met LeeLee and Jordan. Large, dark, stubborn, and condemned. I’ve never been called &lt;em&gt;resource-intensive&lt;/em&gt;. But I have been called a waste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And maybe that’s why I do it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I get to my last plant of the day, I don’t reach for the mister. This one is small, young, the green still neon-bright and the teeth at the edges still soft. I pick it up, careful with its roots, and carry it home. I find a discarded water container along the way and place it inside. When I get home I knock on LeeLee’s door. She doesn’t answer, so I leave the plant on the floor as an offering. They aren’t proper flowers, but they smell nice and earthy. It might keep the residual odor from melted organs, fur, and bones from taking over her room.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Killing things is a dumb job,” says the girl.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After a week of hearing the death cries of its cousins, I was moved to use some of my allowance to buy cheap fertilizer and growth serum for my plant. The girl and her friends, fewer than before, were panhandling at the megastore across the way. She ran over, braids jingling, as soon as she saw me. I thought she’d leave once I gave her more glowsticks for her friends, but she stayed in step and kept following me.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It’s not a dumb job,” I say, even though it is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What’s the point?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I shift my bag to point at the bottom of my vest. Beneath “Mercy Dept.” the department’s slogan is written in cursive: &lt;em&gt;Killing to Save!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“See?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;She sees the text but doesn’t register it, and I have to remind myself that even getting kicked out of school is a privilege. The city had decided to stop wasting educational resources on me. They’d never even tried with her or the other streetrats.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It just means we kill to help.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That doesn’t make sense.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, all I can think about is Jordan. “Maybe they don’t mind.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think of the plants. Maybe they hadn’t been pleading. Maybe they’d been sighing with relief. I think of the birds that eventually stopped running away.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Maybe they’re tired. The city’s right, and their existence isn’t compatible with the world we made. And that’s our fault for being stupid and cruel, but it makes their lives so hard. We’ve made it so they can only live half a life. Maybe the least we can do is finish the job.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a terrible thing to say—even worse to a kid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her eyes go hard. “What are you killing now, executioner?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question surprises me. “Sewer plants. Why?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe you.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d wanted her to leave me alone, but when she runs away I feel suddenly empty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have an issue at work when I can’t find my poison vial.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I tell them it rolled away in the sewer and I couldn’t catch it in time, because I don’t want to tell them I was unobservant enough to let a street kid steal from me. After a stern warning and a mountain of forms, they issue a new vial and don’t add to my service time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_30"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pulling overtime to make up for the day I didn’t have my poison means it’s days before I get to fertilize my houseplant. LeeLee’s door is open, so I bring in the fertilizer and serum. She’s put the plant on her windowsill, but it prefers indirect sunlight, so I move it to the shelf next to her boxes of knickknacks and trinkets. I add the fertilizer to its soil and am about to spray it with the growth serum when I get an idea. I get the mister from my kit and set it up to spray the prepping solution on the little plant to prime it. I open the window and put on my mask, just in case, but I’m sure the man was telling the truth when he called the first liquid harmless. After its cells are open, I spray it with my store-bought growth serum.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m halfway through making dinner when I hear the crash and run into LeeLee’s room.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Shit!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_32"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plant has grown huge, turning adult instantly, and its new weight has taken down LeeLee’s shelf. Dainty keepsake boxes are shattered on our concrete floor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I bend to my knees quickly, so focused on fixing my mistake that I don’t register the oddness of the items I’m picking up—jacks, kids’ toys, a bow—until my fingers touch something small and shimmering. It’s a scrap of silver, still rounded in the shape of the braids it was taken from.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I got rats. I can handle it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d forgotten the city has more than one kind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m waiting up when Lee gets home. I don’t make her tell me. I just grab her kit and rummage through it. Where my kit has a hazmat suit, hers has a stealth mesh to render her invisible. Where I keep my mister, she has a gun loaded with vials too large for rats. I have a mini-vac to suck up excess plant matter to prevent seeds from sprouting. She has zip ties.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the time I’m done, she’s already cracking under the weight of everything she tried to protect me from. Within moments she’s sobbing on the floor. I carry her to her bed and get in beside her. I try not to listen too closely as she recounts every horrible moment, but I’m listening at the end, when she tells me she can’t do it anymore. When she confesses that she’s the one who stole my poison, and has only been waiting to take it because she didn’t have the stomach to do to me what Jordan did to us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_34"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I leave her for just a moment, but by the time I lie back in bed beside her I’ve figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I tell her that she won’t have to take her shift tomorrow. I tell her I’m going to go around the city with my mister and my growth serum. That I’ll move plants from sewers to the yards around City Hall and every public space and the support pylons of important people’s companies, and then spray them so they become huge. The city will freak. I tell her it will be like the kittens, but this time we’ll all be pulled off our assignments to kill plants. And maybe the serum will work too well. Maybe the city was right to fear these plants, and they will grow and grow and eat our concrete while the roots crack our foundations and cut our electricity and everything will crumble. And the people with something to lose might suffer, but the rest of us will just laugh at the perfection of rubble. I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_36"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She asks if I’ll put any at our old detention center.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I tell her, &lt;em&gt;Hundreds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I talk long enough that her eyes close, and loud enough that neither of us can hear the sound of my mister blowing. The man who gave it to me was right. Even without the mask, it doesn’t smell like sulfur. It doesn’t smell like anything.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Micaiah Johnson’s debut novel,&lt;/em&gt; The Space Between Worlds&lt;em&gt;, a &lt;/em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;em&gt; bestseller and &lt;/em&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; Editors’ Choice pick, was named one of the best books of 2020 and one of the best science fiction books of the last decade by NPR.

Her doctor couldn’t diagnose the cause but said a good, supportive bra could help. A professor of biomechanics, Wakefield-Scurr thought she could do a little research and find a science-backed option. Two decades later, she’s still looking. Wakefield-Scurr now leads an 18-person team at the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Their research shows that the most effective high-impact-sports bras have underwires, padded cups, adjustable underbands and shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye closures. These bras reduce breast movement by up to 74% when compared with wearing no bra. But movement might not be the only metric that matters.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A biological rarity&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Few anatomical structures hang outside of the body unsupported by cartilage, muscle, or bone—meaning there wasn’t much historical research to build on. Wakefield-Scurr’s lab was the first to find that when women run, the motion of the torso causes breasts to move in a three-dimensional pattern—swinging side to side and up and down—as well as moving forward and backward. In an hour of slow jogging, boobs can bounce approximately 10,000 times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A sports necessity&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wearing a bra that’s too tight can limit breathing. Wearing one that’s too loose can create back, shoulder, and neck pain. Pain can also be caused by the lag between torso and breast movement, which causes what is scientifically known as “breast slap.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The lab’s research has also found that the physical discomfort of bad bras, combined with the embarrassment of flopping around, is the one of the biggest barriers to exercise for women and that if women have a good sports bra, they’re more willing to go for a run.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An open question&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some bras function by deliberately compressing breasts. Others encapsulate and support each individual breast. But scientists still don’t know whether it’s more biomechanically important to reduce the breasts’ motion entirely, to reduce the speed at which they move, or to reduce breast slap. Will women constantly be forced to choose between the comfort of a stretchier bra and the support of a more restrictive one?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wakefield-Scurr is excited about new materials she’s tested that tighten or stretch depending on how you move. She’s working with fabric manufacturers and clothing companies to try out their wares. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As more women take up high-impact sports, the need to understand what makes a good bra grows.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The system will be hosted in India and follow local data residency, security, and compliance rules. The project aims to provide computing resources for AI applications to educational institutions, government entities, and small and medium enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Sovereign AI infrastructure is becoming essential for national competitiveness. This project brings that capability to India at a national scale, enabling local researchers, innovators, and enterprises to become AI-native while maintaining full data sovereignty and security,” Manu Jain, CEO of G42 India, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Abu Dhabi’s&amp;nbsp;Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and India’s Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) are also part of the project. Last year, MBZUAI and G42 released Nanda 87B, a Hindi-English large language model built on Meta’s Llama 3.1 70B model, which is purported to understand casual speech in Hindi and English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Deploying this system in India marks a significant step forward in the country’s computational capacity and sovereign AI initiatives. It will accelerate training and inference for large-scale models, enabling researchers and developers to build AI tailored to India’s needs,” said Andy Hock, chief strategy officer at Cerebras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The India AI Impact Summit this week saw several AI infrastructure initiatives being launched by both Indian giants and international firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indian conglomerate Adani pledged $100 billion to build up to 5 gigawatts of data center capacity in the country by 2035. Reliance also said it would invest $110 billion over the next seven years for gigawatt-scale data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has teamed up with Tata Group to secure 100 megawatts of AI compute in the country as part of its Stargate project and will eventually scale it to 1 gigawatts. And India’s technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said at the summit that the country plans to attract over $200 billion in infrastructure investment over the next two years by rolling out a mix of tax incentives, state-backed venture capital, and policy support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So far, U.S. technology giants, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have already committed about $70 billion to expand AI and cloud infrastructure in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Super-computer-G42.jpg?resize=1200,676" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Abu Dhabi-based tech company G42 has partnered with U.S.-based chipmaker Cerebras to deploy 8 exaflops of computing power via a new supercomputer system in India, the companies said on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Sovereign AI infrastructure is becoming essential for national competitiveness. This project brings that capability to India at a national scale, enabling local researchers, innovators, and enterprises to become AI-native while maintaining full data sovereignty and security,” Manu Jain, CEO of G42 India, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Abu Dhabi’s&amp;nbsp;Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and India’s Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) are also part of the project. Last year, MBZUAI and G42 released Nanda 87B, a Hindi-English large language model built on Meta’s Llama 3.1 70B model, which is purported to understand casual speech in Hindi and English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Deploying this system in India marks a significant step forward in the country’s computational capacity and sovereign AI initiatives. It will accelerate training and inference for large-scale models, enabling researchers and developers to build AI tailored to India’s needs,” said Andy Hock, chief strategy officer at Cerebras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The India AI Impact Summit this week saw several AI infrastructure initiatives being launched by both Indian giants and international firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indian conglomerate Adani pledged $100 billion to build up to 5 gigawatts of data center capacity in the country by 2035. Reliance also said it would invest $110 billion over the next seven years for gigawatt-scale data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has teamed up with Tata Group to secure 100 megawatts of AI compute in the country as part of its Stargate project and will eventually scale it to 1 gigawatts. And India’s technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said at the summit that the country plans to attract over $200 billion in infrastructure investment over the next two years by rolling out a mix of tax incentives, state-backed venture capital, and policy support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So far, U.S. technology giants, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have already committed about $70 billion to expand AI and cloud infrastructure in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/20/uaes-g42-teams-up-with-cerebras-to-deploy-8-exaflops-of-compute-in-india/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 11:58:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Microsoft deletes blog telling users to train AI on pirated Harry Potter books (AI - Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/microsoft-removes-guide-on-how-to-train-llms-on-pirated-harry-potter-books/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following backlash in a Hacker News thread, Microsoft deleted a blog post that critics said encouraged developers to pirate Harry Potter books to train AI models that could then be used to create AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog, which is archived here, was written in November 2024 by a senior product manager, Pooja Kamath. According to her LinkedIn, Kamath has been at Microsoft for more than a decade and remains with the company. In 2024, Microsoft tapped her to promote a new feature that the blog said made it easier to “add generative AI features to your own applications with just a few lines of code using Azure SQL DB, LangChain, and LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What better way to show “engaging and relatable examples” of Microsoft’s new feature that would “resonate with a wide audience” than to “use a well-known dataset” like Harry Potter books, the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books are “one of the most famous and cherished series in literary history,” the blog noted, and fans could use the LLMs they trained in two fun ways: building Q&amp;amp;A systems providing “context-rich answers” and generating “new AI-driven Harry Potter fan fiction” that’s “sure to delight Potterheads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help Microsoft customers achieve this vision, the blog linked to a Kaggle dataset that included all seven Harry Potter books, which, Ars verified, has been available online for years and incorrectly marked as “public domain.” Kaggle’s terms say that rights holders can send notices of infringing content, and repeat offenders risk suspensions, but Hacker News commenters speculated that the Harry Potter dataset flew under the radar, with only 10,000 downloads over time, not catching the attention of J.K. Rowling, who famously keeps a strong grip on the Harry Potter copyrights. The dataset was promptly deleted on Thursday after Ars reached out to the uploader, Shubham Maindola, a data scientist in India with no apparent links to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
            
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Maindola told Ars that “the dataset was marked as Public Domain by mistake. There was no intention to misrepresent the licensing status of the works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether Kamath was directed to link to the Harry Potter books dataset in the blog or if it was an individual choice. Cathay Y. N. Smith, a law professor and co-director of Chicago-Kent College of Law’s Program in Intellectual Property Law, told Ars that Kamath may not have realized the books were too recent to be in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone might be really knowledgeable about books and technology, but not necessarily about copyright terms and how long they last,” Smith said. “Especially if she saw that something was marked by another reputable company as being public domain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined Ars’ request to comment. Kaggle did not respond to Ars’ request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft was “probably smart” to pull the blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Hacker News, commenters suggested that it’s unlikely anyone familiar with the popular franchise would believe the Harry Potter books were in the public domain. They debated whether Microsoft’s blog was “problematic copyright-wise,” since Microsoft not only encouraged customers to download the infringing materials but also used the books themselves to create Harry Potter AI models that relied on beloved characters to hype Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s blog was posted more than a year ago, at a time when AI firms began facing lawsuits over AI models, which had allegedly infringed copyrights by training on pirated materials and regurgitating works verbatim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog recommended that users learn to train their own AI models by downloading the Harry Potter dataset and then uploading text files to Azure Blob Storage. It included example models based on a dataset that Microsoft seemingly uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, which only included the first book, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s&amp;nbsp;Stone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
            
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training large language models (LLMs) on text files, Harry Potter fans could create Q&amp;amp;A systems capable of pulling up relevant excerpts of books. An example query offered was “Wizarding World snacks,” which retrieved an excerpt from &lt;em&gt;The Sorcerer’s&amp;nbsp;Stone&lt;/em&gt; where Harry marvels at strange treats like Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans and chocolate frogs. Another prompt asking “How did Harry feel when he first learnt that he was a Wizard?” generated an output pointing to various early excerpts in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="md:hidden"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-content "&gt;
              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Example from Microsoft’s blog of a Q&amp;amp;A system output.&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="hidden md:block"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-content left"&gt;
              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Example from Microsoft’s blog of a Q&amp;amp;A system output.&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption"&gt;

              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Example from Microsoft’s blog of a Q&amp;amp;A system output.&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps an even more exciting use case, Kamath suggested, was generating fan fiction to “explore new adventures” and “even create alternate endings.” That model could quickly comb the dataset for “contextually similar” excerpts that could be used to output fresh stories that fit with existing narratives and incorporate “elements from the retrieved passages,” the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, Kamath trained a model to write a Harry Potter story she could use to market the feature she was blogging about. She asked the model to write a story in which Harry meets a new friend on the Hogwarts Express train who tells him all about Microsoft’s Native Vector Support in SQL “in the Muggle world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on parts of &lt;em&gt;The Sorcerer’s Stone&lt;/em&gt; where Harry learns about Quidditch and gets to know Hermione Granger, the fan fiction showed a boy selling Harry on Microsoft’s “amazing” new feature. To do this, he likened it to having a spell that helps you find exactly what you need among thousands of options, instantly, while declaring it was perfect for machine learning, AI, and recommendation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further blurring the lines between Microsoft and Harry Potter brands, Kamath also generated an image showing Harry with his new friend, stamped with a Microsoft logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith told Ars that both use cases could frustrate rights holders, depending on the content in the model outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think that the regurgitation and the creation of fan fiction, they both could flag copyright issues, in that fan fiction often has to take from the expressive elements, a copyrighted character, a character that’s famous enough to be protected by a copyright law or plot stories or sequences,” Smith said. “If these things are copied and reproduced, then that output could be potentially infringing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also still a gray area. Looking at the blog, Smith said, “I would be concerned,” but “I wouldn’t say it’s automatically infringement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith told Ars that, in pulling the blog, Microsoft “was probably smart,” since courts have only generally said that training AI on copyrighted books is fair use. But courts continue to probe questions about pirated AI training materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the deleted Kaggle dataset page, Maindola previously explained that to source the data, he “downloaded the ebooks and then converted them to txt files.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft may have infringed copyrights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft ever faced questions as to whether the company knowingly used pirated books to train the example models, fair use “could be a difficult argument,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker News commenters suggested the blog could be considered fair use, since the training guide was for “educational purposes,” and Smith said that Microsoft could raise some “good arguments” in its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, she also suggested that Microsoft could be deemed liable for contributing to infringement on some level after leaving the blog up for a year. Before it was removed, the Kaggle dataset was downloaded more than 10,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ultimate result is to create something infringing by saying, ‘Hey, here you go, go grab that infringing stuff and use that in our system,’” Smith said. “They could potentially have some sort of secondary contributory liability for copyright infringement, downloading it, as well as then using it to encourage others to use it for training purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Hacker News, commenters slammed the blog, including a self-described former Microsoft employee who claimed that Microsoft lets employees “blog without having to go through some approval or editing process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks like somebody made a bad judgment call on what to put in a company blog post (and maybe what constitutes ethical activity) and that it was taken down as soon as someone noticed,” the former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others suggested the blame was solely with the Kaggle uploader, Maindola, who told Ars that the dataset should never have been marked “public domain.” But Microsoft critics pushed back, noting that the Kaggle page made it clear that no special permission was granted and that Microsoft’s employee should have known better. “They don’t need to know any details to know that these properties belong to massive companies and aren’t free for the taking,” one commenter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harry Potter books weren’t the only books targeted, the thread noted, linking to a separate Azure sample containing Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, which is also not in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft could have used any dataset for their blog, they could have even chosen to use actual public domain novels,” another Hacker News commenter wrote. “Instead, they opted to use copywritten works that J.K. hasn’t released into the public domain (unless user ‘Shubham Maindola’ is J.K.’s alter ego).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith suggested Microsoft could have avoided this week’s backlash by more carefully reviewing blogs, noting that “if a company is risk averse, this would probably be flagged.” But she also understood Kamath’s preference for Harry Potter over the many long-forgotten characters that exist in the public domain. On Hacker News, some commenters defended Kamath’s blog, urging that it should be considered fair use since nonprofits and educational institutions could do the same thing in a teaching context without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would have been concerned if I were the one clearing this for Microsoft, but at the same time, I completely understand what this employee was doing,” Smith said. “No one wants to write fan fiction about books that are in the public domain.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following backlash in a Hacker News thread, Microsoft deleted a blog post that critics said encouraged developers to pirate Harry Potter books to train AI models that could then be used to create AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog, which is archived here, was written in November 2024 by a senior product manager, Pooja Kamath. According to her LinkedIn, Kamath has been at Microsoft for more than a decade and remains with the company. In 2024, Microsoft tapped her to promote a new feature that the blog said made it easier to “add generative AI features to your own applications with just a few lines of code using Azure SQL DB, LangChain, and LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What better way to show “engaging and relatable examples” of Microsoft’s new feature that would “resonate with a wide audience” than to “use a well-known dataset” like Harry Potter books, the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books are “one of the most famous and cherished series in literary history,” the blog noted, and fans could use the LLMs they trained in two fun ways: building Q&amp;amp;A systems providing “context-rich answers” and generating “new AI-driven Harry Potter fan fiction” that’s “sure to delight Potterheads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help Microsoft customers achieve this vision, the blog linked to a Kaggle dataset that included all seven Harry Potter books, which, Ars verified, has been available online for years and incorrectly marked as “public domain.” Kaggle’s terms say that rights holders can send notices of infringing content, and repeat offenders risk suspensions, but Hacker News commenters speculated that the Harry Potter dataset flew under the radar, with only 10,000 downloads over time, not catching the attention of J.K. Rowling, who famously keeps a strong grip on the Harry Potter copyrights. The dataset was promptly deleted on Thursday after Ars reached out to the uploader, Shubham Maindola, a data scientist in India with no apparent links to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
            
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maindola told Ars that “the dataset was marked as Public Domain by mistake. There was no intention to misrepresent the licensing status of the works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether Kamath was directed to link to the Harry Potter books dataset in the blog or if it was an individual choice. Cathay Y. N. Smith, a law professor and co-director of Chicago-Kent College of Law’s Program in Intellectual Property Law, told Ars that Kamath may not have realized the books were too recent to be in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone might be really knowledgeable about books and technology, but not necessarily about copyright terms and how long they last,” Smith said. “Especially if she saw that something was marked by another reputable company as being public domain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined Ars’ request to comment. Kaggle did not respond to Ars’ request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft was “probably smart” to pull the blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Hacker News, commenters suggested that it’s unlikely anyone familiar with the popular franchise would believe the Harry Potter books were in the public domain. They debated whether Microsoft’s blog was “problematic copyright-wise,” since Microsoft not only encouraged customers to download the infringing materials but also used the books themselves to create Harry Potter AI models that relied on beloved characters to hype Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s blog was posted more than a year ago, at a time when AI firms began facing lawsuits over AI models, which had allegedly infringed copyrights by training on pirated materials and regurgitating works verbatim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog recommended that users learn to train their own AI models by downloading the Harry Potter dataset and then uploading text files to Azure Blob Storage. It included example models based on a dataset that Microsoft seemingly uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, which only included the first book, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s&amp;nbsp;Stone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
            
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training large language models (LLMs) on text files, Harry Potter fans could create Q&amp;amp;A systems capable of pulling up relevant excerpts of books. An example query offered was “Wizarding World snacks,” which retrieved an excerpt from &lt;em&gt;The Sorcerer’s&amp;nbsp;Stone&lt;/em&gt; where Harry marvels at strange treats like Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans and chocolate frogs. Another prompt asking “How did Harry feel when he first learnt that he was a Wizard?” generated an output pointing to various early excerpts in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Example from Microsoft’s blog of a Q&amp;amp;A system output.&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="hidden md:block"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption"&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-content right"&gt;
              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Example from Microsoft’s blog of a Q&amp;amp;A system output.&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps an even more exciting use case, Kamath suggested, was generating fan fiction to “explore new adventures” and “even create alternate endings.” That model could quickly comb the dataset for “contextually similar” excerpts that could be used to output fresh stories that fit with existing narratives and incorporate “elements from the retrieved passages,” the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, Kamath trained a model to write a Harry Potter story she could use to market the feature she was blogging about. She asked the model to write a story in which Harry meets a new friend on the Hogwarts Express train who tells him all about Microsoft’s Native Vector Support in SQL “in the Muggle world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on parts of &lt;em&gt;The Sorcerer’s Stone&lt;/em&gt; where Harry learns about Quidditch and gets to know Hermione Granger, the fan fiction showed a boy selling Harry on Microsoft’s “amazing” new feature. To do this, he likened it to having a spell that helps you find exactly what you need among thousands of options, instantly, while declaring it was perfect for machine learning, AI, and recommendation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further blurring the lines between Microsoft and Harry Potter brands, Kamath also generated an image showing Harry with his new friend, stamped with a Microsoft logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith told Ars that both use cases could frustrate rights holders, depending on the content in the model outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think that the regurgitation and the creation of fan fiction, they both could flag copyright issues, in that fan fiction often has to take from the expressive elements, a copyrighted character, a character that’s famous enough to be protected by a copyright law or plot stories or sequences,” Smith said. “If these things are copied and reproduced, then that output could be potentially infringing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also still a gray area. Looking at the blog, Smith said, “I would be concerned,” but “I wouldn’t say it’s automatically infringement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith told Ars that, in pulling the blog, Microsoft “was probably smart,” since courts have only generally said that training AI on copyrighted books is fair use. But courts continue to probe questions about pirated AI training materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the deleted Kaggle dataset page, Maindola previously explained that to source the data, he “downloaded the ebooks and then converted them to txt files.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft may have infringed copyrights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft ever faced questions as to whether the company knowingly used pirated books to train the example models, fair use “could be a difficult argument,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker News commenters suggested the blog could be considered fair use, since the training guide was for “educational purposes,” and Smith said that Microsoft could raise some “good arguments” in its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, she also suggested that Microsoft could be deemed liable for contributing to infringement on some level after leaving the blog up for a year. Before it was removed, the Kaggle dataset was downloaded more than 10,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ultimate result is to create something infringing by saying, ‘Hey, here you go, go grab that infringing stuff and use that in our system,’” Smith said. “They could potentially have some sort of secondary contributory liability for copyright infringement, downloading it, as well as then using it to encourage others to use it for training purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Hacker News, commenters slammed the blog, including a self-described former Microsoft employee who claimed that Microsoft lets employees “blog without having to go through some approval or editing process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks like somebody made a bad judgment call on what to put in a company blog post (and maybe what constitutes ethical activity) and that it was taken down as soon as someone noticed,” the former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others suggested the blame was solely with the Kaggle uploader, Maindola, who told Ars that the dataset should never have been marked “public domain.” But Microsoft critics pushed back, noting that the Kaggle page made it clear that no special permission was granted and that Microsoft’s employee should have known better. “They don’t need to know any details to know that these properties belong to massive companies and aren’t free for the taking,” one commenter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harry Potter books weren’t the only books targeted, the thread noted, linking to a separate Azure sample containing Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, which is also not in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft could have used any dataset for their blog, they could have even chosen to use actual public domain novels,” another Hacker News commenter wrote. “Instead, they opted to use copywritten works that J.K. hasn’t released into the public domain (unless user ‘Shubham Maindola’ is J.K.’s alter ego).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith suggested Microsoft could have avoided this week’s backlash by more carefully reviewing blogs, noting that “if a company is risk averse, this would probably be flagged.” But she also understood Kamath’s preference for Harry Potter over the many long-forgotten characters that exist in the public domain. On Hacker News, some commenters defended Kamath’s blog, urging that it should be considered fair use since nonprofits and educational institutions could do the same thing in a teaching context without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would have been concerned if I were the one clearing this for Microsoft, but at the same time, I completely understand what this employee was doing,” Smith said. “No one wants to write fan fiction about books that are in the public domain.”&lt;/p&gt;

Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated.

The company said on Friday that users between 18 and 24 years of age accounted for nearly 50% of messages sent to ChatGPT in the country, and users under 30 accounted for 80%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI lab said Indians use ChatGPT mostly for work, with 35% of all messages relating to professional tasks, compared to 30% globally. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In particular, the company’s coding assistant, Codex, is seeing strong traction: OpenAI said Indians use Codex three times more than the global median, and weekly usage has increased by four times since the tool got a Mac app two weeks ago. Users in India are also asking three times as many coding-related questions as the median.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is in line with findings from Anthropic, which earlier this week said 45.2% of Claude’s tasks map to software-related use cases in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said outside of work tasks, 35% of messages to ChatGPT from Indians requested guidance, 20% concerned questions about general information, and 20% were requests for the bot to produce or help with writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India is OpenAI’s second-largest market with more than 100 million weekly users, and the company has been actively trying to court Indians for its AI tools and services. The company offers a sub-$5 subscription tier in the country, and last year even ran promotional campaigns to spur adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI adoption is moving faster than our ability to measure it – and that’s a challenge for anyone trying to make smart decisions. Signals is our way of putting real-world evidence on the table, so India’s AI debate can be grounded in facts, not hype,” OpenAI’s chief economist Ronnie Chatterji said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s cloud unit has suffered at least two outages due to errors involving its own AI tools, leading some employees to raise doubts about the US tech giant’s push to roll out these coding assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services experienced a 13-hour interruption to one system used by its customers in mid-December after engineers allowed its Kiro AI coding tool to make certain changes, according to four people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people said the agentic tool, which can take autonomous actions on behalf of users, determined that the best course of action was to “delete and recreate the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon posted an internal postmortem about the “outage” of the AWS system, which lets customers explore the costs of its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple Amazon employees told the FT that this was the second occasion in recent months in which one of the group’s AI tools had been at the center of a service disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve already seen at least two production outages [in the past few months],” said one senior AWS employee. “The engineers let the AI [agent] resolve an issue without intervention. The outages were small but entirely foreseeable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS, which accounts for 60 percent of Amazon’s operating profits, is seeking to build and deploy AI tools including “agents” capable of taking actions independently based on human instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many Big Tech companies, it is seeking to sell this technology to outside customers. The incidents highlight the risk that these nascent AI tools can misbehave and cause disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said it was a “coincidence that AI tools were involved” and that “the same issue could occur with any developer tool or manual action.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;

      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
            
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” Amazon said, adding that it had not seen evidence that mistakes were more common with AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said the incident in December was an “extremely limited event” affecting only a single service in parts of mainland China. Amazon added that the second incident did not have an impact on a “customer facing AWS service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither disruption was anywhere near as severe as a 15-hour AWS outage in October 2025 that forced multiple customers’ apps and websites offline—including OpenAI’s ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees said the group’s AI tools were treated as an extension of an operator and given the same permissions. In these two cases, the engineers involved did not require a second person’s approval before making changes, as would normally be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said that by default its Kiro tool “requests authorisation before taking any action” but said the engineer involved in the December incident had “broader permissions than expected—a user access control issue, not an AI autonomy issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS launched Kiro in July. It said the coding assistant would advance beyond “vibe coding”—which allows users to quickly build applications—to instead write code based on a set of specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group had earlier relied on its Amazon Q Developer product, an AI-enabled chatbot, to help engineers write code. This was involved in the earlier outage, three of the employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Amazon employees said they were still skeptical of AI tools’ utility for the bulk of their work given the risk of error. They added that the company had set a target for 80 percent of developers to use AI for coding tasks at least once a week and was closely tracking adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said it was experiencing strong customer growth for Kiro and that it wanted customers and employees to benefit from efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the December incident, AWS implemented numerous safeguards,” including mandatory peer review and staff training, Amazon added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon said it was a “coincidence that AI tools were involved” and that “the same issue could occur with any developer tool or manual action.”&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” Amazon said, adding that it had not seen evidence that mistakes were more common with AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said the incident in December was an “extremely limited event” affecting only a single service in parts of mainland China. Amazon added that the second incident did not have an impact on a “customer facing AWS service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither disruption was anywhere near as severe as a 15-hour AWS outage in October 2025 that forced multiple customers’ apps and websites offline—including OpenAI’s ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees said the group’s AI tools were treated as an extension of an operator and given the same permissions. In these two cases, the engineers involved did not require a second person’s approval before making changes, as would normally be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said that by default its Kiro tool “requests authorisation before taking any action” but said the engineer involved in the December incident had “broader permissions than expected—a user access control issue, not an AI autonomy issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS launched Kiro in July. It said the coding assistant would advance beyond “vibe coding”—which allows users to quickly build applications—to instead write code based on a set of specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group had earlier relied on its Amazon Q Developer product, an AI-enabled chatbot, to help engineers write code. This was involved in the earlier outage, three of the employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Amazon employees said they were still skeptical of AI tools’ utility for the bulk of their work given the risk of error. They added that the company had set a target for 80 percent of developers to use AI for coding tasks at least once a week and was closely tracking adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said it was experiencing strong customer growth for Kiro and that it wanted customers and employees to benefit from efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the December incident, AWS implemented numerous safeguards,” including mandatory peer review and staff training, Amazon added.&lt;/p&gt;

The firm, which now manages more than $10 billion in assets, is sharpening its focus on artificial intelligence and cross-border bets amid intensifying competition for deals in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The capital will be deployed across its India seed and venture funds as well as its APAC vehicle. A majority is earmarked for India, with the firm expecting to invest the pool over the next two to three years, managing director Shailendra Singh said in an interview on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Peak XV split from Sequoia Capital in 2023, in an effort to separate the India-focused portions of Sequoia’s portfolio. The firm now counts more than 450 portfolio companies across fintech, software, and consumer internet, spanning seed to growth stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm’s new fundraise comes as New Delhi hosts the AI Impact Summit, drawing major technology players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. At the event, General Catalyst outlined plans to invest $5 billion in the country over the next five years, sharply increasing its earlier commitment to the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Singh said Peak XV is not trying to match rivals dollar-for-dollar, emphasizing that the firm’s priority is generating strong returns rather than maximizing assets under management. The firm will continue to size its funds based on where it sees the best opportunity to deliver “high-performing funds,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that Peak XV is still building its presence in the U.S. and is selective about where it competes. “In the U.S. market, we are an underdog — and that’s great,” Singh said, adding that the firm is focusing on areas where its experience in software, developer tools, and fintech gives it an edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest fundraise follows a period of leadership changes at Peak XV, including the recent departures of senior partner Ashish Agrawal and investors Ishaan Mittal and Tejeshwi Sharma. Singh told TechCrunch the firm retains significant experience on its leadership team, noting that five of its seven managing partners have been with Peak XV for more than a decade. The broader Peak XV team includes more than 30 full-time investors, with about a dozen leading investments across its markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Peak XV has returned more than $7 billion in cash to investors since inception, Singh said, adding that 35 of its portfolio companies have gone public. He declined to specify distributions since the firm’s split from Sequoia Capital. In September 2024, TechCrunch reported that the firm had returned about $1.2 billion in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ahead of the current raise, Peak XV’s prior fund was sized at $2.85 billion in late 2021, before the firm split from Sequoia Capital. That figure was later reduced to about $2.4 billion as part of what Singh described as a disciplined approach to capital. The earlier pool included Peak XV’s India growth strategy, and Singh said the firm does not plan to raise a new growth fund until more of that dry powder is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Singh expects to deploy the new capital primarily into AI, fintech, and consumer startups, while also seeing emerging opportunities in deep tech. The firm has made more than 80 investments in AI startups to date. He added that the U.S.-India ties are becoming increasingly important as more founders in the region build for global markets.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1244449349.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Peak XV announced on Friday that it has raised $1.3 billion across new India and Asia-focused funds. The firm, which now manages more than $10 billion in assets, is sharpening its focus on artificial intelligence and cross-border bets amid intensifying competition for deals in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The capital will be deployed across its India seed and venture funds as well as its APAC vehicle. A majority is earmarked for India, with the firm expecting to invest the pool over the next two to three years, managing director Shailendra Singh said in an interview on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Peak XV split from Sequoia Capital in 2023, in an effort to separate the India-focused portions of Sequoia’s portfolio. The firm now counts more than 450 portfolio companies across fintech, software, and consumer internet, spanning seed to growth stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm’s new fundraise comes as New Delhi hosts the AI Impact Summit, drawing major technology players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. At the event, General Catalyst outlined plans to invest $5 billion in the country over the next five years, sharply increasing its earlier commitment to the market.&lt;/p&gt;

Birds chirp, contributing to the tropical din, as he approaches a shrine at the base of a starfruit tree. He bends to inspect a framed black-and-white photograph of a woman, her hair in a 1950s side part.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Suddenly, a gust of wind shakes the tree’s branches, knocking over the contents of the shrine. The man steps back, trips on a root, and hits his head. When he awakens, he’s in a dark, misty forest, a woman wearing a clay mask standing over him, brandishing a sword.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Who are you who dares to sleep under the sacred tree?” she asks in Ilocano, a Philippine language widely spoken in Hawaii’s Filipino community, while holding the sword at his throat. He replies that he’s lost and turns to flee. She chases, alternating between running and floating through the air. He falls again. She advances, sword held high. He throws a rock at her, shattering the clay mask and revealing half her face.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Mom?” he asks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is the opening of “Murmuray,” a short film by independent filmmaker Brad Tangonan. Everything about this film felt like his previous work, from the tactile nature shots to the dreamlike desaturated highlights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The only difference? He made it using AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tangonan was one of 10 filmmakers to participate in Google Flow Sessions, a five-week cohort that gave creatives access to Google’s suite of AI tools to produce short films, including Gemini, image generator Nano Banana Pro, and film generator Veo.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Each film differed in scope. Hal Watmough’s “You’ve Been Here Before” blended hyperreal, lifelike visuals with cartoonish stylization to playfully explore the importance of a morning routine, while Tabitha Swanson’s “The Antidote to Fear is Curiosity” is a more esoteric, philosophical conversation about our relationship with AI and ourselves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None of these short films, which were screened at Soho House New York late last year, felt like AI slop. Each independent filmmaker I spoke to said that, in the case of these films, AI had enabled them to tell a story they otherwise wouldn’t have had the budget or time to tell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I see all of these tools, whether it be a camera you can pick up or generative AI, as ways for an artist to express what they have in their mind,” Tangonan told me after the screenings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This AI-is-just-another-tool-for-creators argument is certainly the message Google is trying to underscore. Google isn’t wrong; AI will increasingly be part of a creator’s toolkit as video generation products improve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, companies like Google, Runway, OpenAI, Kling, Luma AI, and Higgsfield progressed far beyond the uncanny, prompt-based novelties of the year prior. The AI video industry, with billions in venture capital dollars in tow, is now moving from prototype to post-production.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This era of AI abundance that has provided tools to “democratize access” to the film industry also threatens to erase jobs and creativity, smothering them under an avalanche of low-effort slop. The existential stakes have pitted creatives against one another. Those who engage with AI risk being labeled as complicit; those who don’t risk becoming obsolete.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The question isn’t whether the tools belong in the toolkit — they’re coming, whether we like it or not. Instead it is: What kind of filmmaking survives when the industry pushes for speed and scale over quality? And what happens when individual artists use the same tools to make something that actually matters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-is-it-slop"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is it slop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3094472" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam used AI to animate scans of plants and fish in her short film “Mimesis”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Keenan MacWilliam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The arguments against AI in filmmaking are plentiful — and from some of the highest-profile names in the industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro said last October that he would rather die than use generative AI to make a film. James Cameron said in a recent CBS interview the idea of generating actors and emotions with prompts is “horrifying,” and that generative AI is only capable of spitting out a blended average of everything that’s ever been done by humans before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Werner Herzog said the films he’s seen created by AI “have no soul.” He added: “The common denominator, and nothing beyond this common denominator, can be found in these fabrications.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cameron and Herzog’s thesis is that AI is taking the wheel of creation out of the hands of humans and couldn’t possibly be used to create a representation of their own lived experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s very easy to be angry with AI as a concept in the machine, but it’s harder to be angry with someone that’s made something personal,” Watmough told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tangonan, who describes “Murmuray” as a “family story,” agrees with that sentiment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI is a facilitator,” Tangonan said. “I’m still making all the creative decisions. When people see ‘AI slop’ online, it’s a lot of lowest common denominator stuff. And, yeah, if you hand over the keys to AI, that’s what you’re going to get. But if you have a voice and a creative perspective and a style, then you’re going to get something different.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using AI in filmmaking doesn’t mean just prompting a film into existence. Tangonan, for example, wrote the script for “Murmuray” without AI and gathered visual references for a shot list. He then fed that content into Nano Banana Pro to generate images that matched his style and served as the foundation for video generation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam also took pains to ensure her short film “Mimesis,” a fictional guided meditation, was a “true extension of [her] visual language, rather than a ‘blender’ of other artists’ work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MacWilliam wrote the script and recorded her own voice for the mock meditation, which was equal parts relaxing and funny. Onscreen, over a black, watery backdrop, psychedelic images of flowers and plants blended into each other, turned into smoke, morphed into seahorses, and swam away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The images all came from MacWilliam’s own collection of scanned flora and fauna — she travels with her scanner everywhere she goes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I spent a lot of time learning how to make apps that were built with my own dataset, and then used those as reference points,” MacWilliam told TechCrunch, adding that she worked with her long-time composer and sound designer on the film. “I made a choice to avoid using AI for anything that I could have shot with a camera or ask my collaborators to animate. My goal was to unlock new forms of expression for my established themes and style, not to replace the roles of the people who I like to work with.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That was a common thread among the filmmakers I spoke to at the Google Flow event — the desire to use AI only in cases when it was not possible to rely on other humans, or when the strange nature of AI generations serve the story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, Sander van Bellegem’s “Melongray” explored the acceleration of life through trippy visualizations. In one shot, a salamander transforms into a balloon. It wasn’t part of his original storyline, but he was inspired by the way AI allowed him to push the limits of both his imagination and physics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-to-be-efficient-or-not-to-be"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be [efficient] or not to be&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today’s film studio budgets are being squeezed by rising filming costs, the pivot to streaming, and risk-averse corporate consolidation. That means big spends are saved for predictable revenue generators (see: the millionth Marvel movie) and original mid-budget movies have all but been abandoned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adding AI to the mix risks exacerbating the scarcity mindset of studios to the point where they might try to replace anything that can be — actors, sets, lighting — art and quality be damned. However, the efficiencies AI brings could also lower barriers and make it easier for film studios to produce original work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even Cameron noted in his CBS interview that generative AI could make VFX cheaper, which could lead to more imaginative sci-fi and fantasy films — expensive endeavors that are reserved for existing IP like “Avatar.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The shot in “Murmuray” where the woman is flying through the forest would have taken expensive VFX or very complex rigging on set, both out of budget for a short film, according to Tangonan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But even filmmakers who see the benefits in efficiency understand the risks to artistic expression.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think efficiency in general is not the best friend of creativity,” MacWilliam said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-empowered-and-isolated"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empowered and isolated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3094473" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Hal Watmough’s short film “You’ve Been Here Before” playfully explores the importance of morning routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Hal Watmough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For independent filmmakers, having so many powerful tools at their disposal is a blessing and a curse. It “democratizes access,” sure, but it also means working alone. The more you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do yourself, the less reason there is to collaborate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I know I’m a one-man band, and I just made all this by myself…but that should never be the way that anyone tells a story or makes a film,” Watmough told TechCrunch, noting that an actor friend of his contributed the voice for his short. “It should be a collaborative process because the more people that are involved, the more accessible it is by everyone and the more it reaches and connects with people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Directors make creative decisions, but not all of them. The filmmakers I spoke to found themselves suddenly playing set designer, lighting director, costumer — roles requiring expertise they didn’t have. It was frustrating and draining, pulling them away from the work they actually cared about. And upsetting to think about how an entire ecosystem could be upended so swiftly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The filmmakers I spoke to also said they’d rather not replace actors with AI, though some said AI-generated actors are an inevitability for smaller studios. The tools exist, and are increasingly getting better, to generate actors, their emotions, their movements. AI video startups like Luma AI, which last November raised a $900 million Series C, are even building technology that allows you to shoot an actor’s performance once, and then use AI to change the character, costume, and set.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In an ideal world, I would work with real actors and some cinematographer and department heads and the full crew to make something amazing and use AI and complement that to be able to do things that we can’t do on set, whether for budgetary or time reasons,” Tangonan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-if-artists-don-t-define-ai-studios-will"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If artists don’t define AI, studios will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think making any creative work that uses new technology always requires a certain kind of gut check and a willingness to have conversations around the work,” MacWilliam said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“These are tools,” she added. “How are you going to use the tool? Are you going to be ethical about it? Are you going to ask questions? Are you going to be transparent and share knowledge?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But many don’t see AI tools as neutral. Labor replacement aside, there are still copyright concerns. AI video generation startup Runway has reportedly scraped thousands of hours of YouTube videos and copyrighted studio content, while others — including Google, OpenAI, and Luma AI — have faced questions about whether they are doing the same, or training on copyrighted films and stock footage without permission. (Though some tools, like Moonvalley’s Marey, are trained only on openly licensed data.) Then there are the environmental horrors — some estimates suggest generating seconds of AI video can consume as much electricity as hours of streaming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unsurprisingly, many of the filmmakers I spoke to said they face stigma for experimenting with AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Whenever I do post things online, a lot of my filmmaking colleagues have a very knee-jerk reaction to it that we should all hold the line and not use any of these tools,” Tangonan said. “I just don’t agree with that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If filmmakers are too afraid to discuss how AI can and should be used and what the ethical boundaries are, then the conversation risks being decided for them. Not by artists trying to use it responsibly, but by efficiency-crazed studios that care more about bottom lines than art.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The film industry is floundering because people aren’t innovating and everything costs too much. We need tools like this for it to survive,” said Watmough. “I think it’s essential that people engage with it because if we don’t, then it’s going to become something we don’t recognize, and that’s not sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article mischaracterized Ilocano as a Hawaiian dialect of Filipino. Ilocano is a language from the northern Philippines and is widely spoken among Filipino communities in Hawaii.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A Filipino man walks through the backyard of his childhood home in rural Hawai’i, his footsteps swooshing through the grass.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Suddenly, a gust of wind shakes the tree’s branches, knocking over the contents of the shrine. The man steps back, trips on a root, and hits his head. When he awakens, he’s in a dark, misty forest, a woman wearing a clay mask standing over him, brandishing a sword.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Who are you who dares to sleep under the sacred tree?” she asks in Ilocano, a Philippine language widely spoken in Hawaii’s Filipino community, while holding the sword at his throat. He replies that he’s lost and turns to flee. She chases, alternating between running and floating through the air. He falls again. She advances, sword held high. He throws a rock at her, shattering the clay mask and revealing half her face.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Each independent filmmaker I spoke to said that, in the case of these films, AI had enabled them to tell a story they otherwise wouldn’t have had the budget or time to tell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I see all of these tools, whether it be a camera you can pick up or generative AI, as ways for an artist to express what they have in their mind,” Tangonan told me after the screenings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This AI-is-just-another-tool-for-creators argument is certainly the message Google is trying to underscore. Google isn’t wrong; AI will increasingly be part of a creator’s toolkit as video generation products improve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, companies like Google, Runway, OpenAI, Kling, Luma AI, and Higgsfield progressed far beyond the uncanny, prompt-based novelties of the year prior. The AI video industry, with billions in venture capital dollars in tow, is now moving from prototype to post-production.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This era of AI abundance that has provided tools to “democratize access” to the film industry also threatens to erase jobs and creativity, smothering them under an avalanche of low-effort slop. The existential stakes have pitted creatives against one another. Those who engage with AI risk being labeled as complicit; those who don’t risk becoming obsolete.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The question isn’t whether the tools belong in the toolkit — they’re coming, whether we like it or not. Instead it is: What kind of filmmaking survives when the industry pushes for speed and scale over quality? And what happens when individual artists use the same tools to make something that actually matters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-is-it-slop"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is it slop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3094472" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam used AI to animate scans of plants and fish in her short film “Mimesis”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Keenan MacWilliam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The arguments against AI in filmmaking are plentiful — and from some of the highest-profile names in the industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro said last October that he would rather die than use generative AI to make a film. James Cameron said in a recent CBS interview the idea of generating actors and emotions with prompts is “horrifying,” and that generative AI is only capable of spitting out a blended average of everything that’s ever been done by humans before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Werner Herzog said the films he’s seen created by AI “have no soul.” He added: “The common denominator, and nothing beyond this common denominator, can be found in these fabrications.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cameron and Herzog’s thesis is that AI is taking the wheel of creation out of the hands of humans and couldn’t possibly be used to create a representation of their own lived experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s very easy to be angry with AI as a concept in the machine, but it’s harder to be angry with someone that’s made something personal,” Watmough told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tangonan, who describes “Murmuray” as a “family story,” agrees with that sentiment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI is a facilitator,” Tangonan said. “I’m still making all the creative decisions. When people see ‘AI slop’ online, it’s a lot of lowest common denominator stuff. And, yeah, if you hand over the keys to AI, that’s what you’re going to get. But if you have a voice and a creative perspective and a style, then you’re going to get something different.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using AI in filmmaking doesn’t mean just prompting a film into existence. Tangonan, for example, wrote the script for “Murmuray” without AI and gathered visual references for a shot list. He then fed that content into Nano Banana Pro to generate images that matched his style and served as the foundation for video generation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam also took pains to ensure her short film “Mimesis,” a fictional guided meditation, was a “true extension of [her] visual language, rather than a ‘blender’ of other artists’ work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MacWilliam wrote the script and recorded her own voice for the mock meditation, which was equal parts relaxing and funny. Onscreen, over a black, watery backdrop, psychedelic images of flowers and plants blended into each other, turned into smoke, morphed into seahorses, and swam away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The images all came from MacWilliam’s own collection of scanned flora and fauna — she travels with her scanner everywhere she goes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I spent a lot of time learning how to make apps that were built with my own dataset, and then used those as reference points,” MacWilliam told TechCrunch, adding that she worked with her long-time composer and sound designer on the film. “I made a choice to avoid using AI for anything that I could have shot with a camera or ask my collaborators to animate. My goal was to unlock new forms of expression for my established themes and style, not to replace the roles of the people who I like to work with.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That was a common thread among the filmmakers I spoke to at the Google Flow event — the desire to use AI only in cases when it was not possible to rely on other humans, or when the strange nature of AI generations serve the story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, Sander van Bellegem’s “Melongray” explored the acceleration of life through trippy visualizations. In one shot, a salamander transforms into a balloon. It wasn’t part of his original storyline, but he was inspired by the way AI allowed him to push the limits of both his imagination and physics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-to-be-efficient-or-not-to-be"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be [efficient] or not to be&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today’s film studio budgets are being squeezed by rising filming costs, the pivot to streaming, and risk-averse corporate consolidation. That means big spends are saved for predictable revenue generators (see: the millionth Marvel movie) and original mid-budget movies have all but been abandoned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adding AI to the mix risks exacerbating the scarcity mindset of studios to the point where they might try to replace anything that can be — actors, sets, lighting — art and quality be damned. However, the efficiencies AI brings could also lower barriers and make it easier for film studios to produce original work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even Cameron noted in his CBS interview that generative AI could make VFX cheaper, which could lead to more imaginative sci-fi and fantasy films — expensive endeavors that are reserved for existing IP like “Avatar.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The shot in “Murmuray” where the woman is flying through the forest would have taken expensive VFX or very complex rigging on set, both out of budget for a short film, according to Tangonan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But even filmmakers who see the benefits in efficiency understand the risks to artistic expression.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think efficiency in general is not the best friend of creativity,” MacWilliam said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-empowered-and-isolated"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empowered and isolated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3094473" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Hal Watmough’s short film “You’ve Been Here Before” playfully explores the importance of morning routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Hal Watmough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For independent filmmakers, having so many powerful tools at their disposal is a blessing and a curse. It “democratizes access,” sure, but it also means working alone. The more you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do yourself, the less reason there is to collaborate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I know I’m a one-man band, and I just made all this by myself…but that should never be the way that anyone tells a story or makes a film,” Watmough told TechCrunch, noting that an actor friend of his contributed the voice for his short. “It should be a collaborative process because the more people that are involved, the more accessible it is by everyone and the more it reaches and connects with people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Directors make creative decisions, but not all of them. The filmmakers I spoke to found themselves suddenly playing set designer, lighting director, costumer — roles requiring expertise they didn’t have. It was frustrating and draining, pulling them away from the work they actually cared about. And upsetting to think about how an entire ecosystem could be upended so swiftly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The filmmakers I spoke to also said they’d rather not replace actors with AI, though some said AI-generated actors are an inevitability for smaller studios. The tools exist, and are increasingly getting better, to generate actors, their emotions, their movements. AI video startups like Luma AI, which last November raised a $900 million Series C, are even building technology that allows you to shoot an actor’s performance once, and then use AI to change the character, costume, and set.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In an ideal world, I would work with real actors and some cinematographer and department heads and the full crew to make something amazing and use AI and complement that to be able to do things that we can’t do on set, whether for budgetary or time reasons,” Tangonan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-if-artists-don-t-define-ai-studios-will"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If artists don’t define AI, studios will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think making any creative work that uses new technology always requires a certain kind of gut check and a willingness to have conversations around the work,” MacWilliam said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“These are tools,” she added. “How are you going to use the tool? Are you going to be ethical about it? Are you going to ask questions? Are you going to be transparent and share knowledge?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But many don’t see AI tools as neutral. Labor replacement aside, there are still copyright concerns. AI video generation startup Runway has reportedly scraped thousands of hours of YouTube videos and copyrighted studio content, while others — including Google, OpenAI, and Luma AI — have faced questions about whether they are doing the same, or training on copyrighted films and stock footage without permission. (Though some tools, like Moonvalley’s Marey, are trained only on openly licensed data.) Then there are the environmental horrors — some estimates suggest generating seconds of AI video can consume as much electricity as hours of streaming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unsurprisingly, many of the filmmakers I spoke to said they face stigma for experimenting with AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Whenever I do post things online, a lot of my filmmaking colleagues have a very knee-jerk reaction to it that we should all hold the line and not use any of these tools,” Tangonan said. “I just don’t agree with that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If filmmakers are too afraid to discuss how AI can and should be used and what the ethical boundaries are, then the conversation risks being decided for them. Not by artists trying to use it responsibly, but by efficiency-crazed studios that care more about bottom lines than art.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The film industry is floundering because people aren’t innovating and everything costs too much. We need tools like this for it to survive,” said Watmough. “I think it’s essential that people engage with it because if we don’t, then it’s going to become something we don’t recognize, and that’s not sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article mischaracterized Ilocano as a Hawaiian dialect of Filipino. Ilocano is a language from the northern Philippines and is widely spoken among Filipino communities in Hawaii.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

No one could have predicted that over thirty years later, Pixar would still be making Toy Story movies, nor could anyone have known that the latest installation in the franchise would pit Buzz Lightyear and a balding Woody against an evil AI tablet called Lilypad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But sure enough, &lt;em&gt;Toy Story 5&lt;/em&gt; confronts old-school toys like Mrs. Potato Head, Rex, and Slinky Dog against the sinister threat of &lt;em&gt;technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The trailer shows Bonnie, the young girl who inherited Andy’s toys when he left for college in &lt;em&gt;Toy Story 2&lt;/em&gt;, playing outside with her toys when a surprise package with the Lilypad tablet arrives for her. She becomes completely enraptured by the tablet, not even looking up from the screen when her parents tell her that screen time is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Toy Story 5&lt;/em&gt; trailer makes the Lilypad — or, Lily — out to be a sinister villain. When Jessie confronts the tablet about Bonnie’s wellbeing, Lily seems not to be paying attention, so the cowgirl demands that the tablet listen to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m always listening,” Lily says ominously, regurgitating Jessie’s impassioned speech in a computerized tone… and then translates it into Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Tech’s invaded our house,” Jessie tells Woody. “I’m losing Bonnie to this device.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Woody replies, “Toys are for play, but tech is for everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

A Q4 2025 survey by GlobalData found that 45 percent of consumers in Asia and Australasia are very or quite likely to purchase a product based on AI recommendations or endorsements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaya Dandey, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData, said: “Whether shoppers realise it or not, machine-learning systems have long been deciding when to encourage consumers to make purchases, which products they can see, and what discounts they can avail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, agentic systems can also complete shopping-related tasks end-to-end.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-computer-vision-and-store-automation"&gt;Computer vision and store automation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises evaluating computer vision and machine learning can observe early implementations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson, for example, introduced AI-enabled ‘Lawson Go’ stores in Japan during 2022. The retailer collaborated with technology provider CloudPick in 2025 to integrate AI, machine learning, and computer vision. This integration eliminates check-out lines and cashiers to enhance the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, retail AI company Fainders.AI launched a compact and cashier-less MicroStore inside a gym in 2024. This deployment improved the accessibility of autonomous retail across different businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI also aids the forecasting and automation of retail replenishment—a capability that applies well to the APAC market, where store footprints are small and replenishment frequency is high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese food retail chain Coop Sapporo uses a camera-based AI system named Sora-cam, developed by Soracom. The system helps the chain avoid overstocking and reduce unsold merchandise on store shelves. Coop Sapporo employs an analytics team to evaluate the generated images. The team determines the optimal shelf display ratio. The Sora-cam system also alerts staff members to apply discount labels on food items close to expiry to prevent wastage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI models track waste and markdown timing while improving promotion efficiency. In Southeast Asian (SEA) markets characterised by high price sensitivity, minor improvements in promotion efficiency increase profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-driven labour optimisation measures include scheduling, task priority lists, and workload balancing. These measures assist retailers in Japan and South Korea, which face structural labour shortages. They also provide efficiency benefits in high-growth SEA markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-agentic-ai-systems-in-retail-are-improving-apac-consumer-interaction"&gt;Agentic AI systems in retail are improving APAC consumer interaction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In food retail, agentic AI is best understood as an AI ‘operator’ that can understand a goal, plan steps, stay within budget or allergen constraints, execute actions across systems, ask clarifying questions, and learn preferences over time,” says Dandey.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers can bypass individual item searches by outlining their overall intent. A customer, for example, might request an AI agent to “Plan five dinners for a family of four, mostly Asian recipes, no shellfish, under 45 minutes.” The agent then generates recipes, builds a shopping cart, sizes quantities, and adds missing staples to the cart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This retail agentic AI capability aligns with regional behaviours, as many APAC households cook frequently and shop fresh. AI agents that recognise local cuisines – such as Korean banchan, Japanese bentos, and Indian spice bases – fit regional habits better than generic Western meal plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many APAC markets, shopping is already deeply integrated with digital wallets, messaging apps, ride-hailing, and delivery ecosystems, making it easier for agentic AI to plug into daily routines,” explains Dandey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nevertheless, some key challenges need to be overcome; ensuring private data sharing consent, minimising hallucinations in terms of allergens and ingredients, and implementing proper localisation of the system with language nuance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DBS pilots system that lets AI agents make payments for customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111908" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

A Q4 2025 survey by GlobalData found that 45 percent of consumers in Asia and Australasia are very or quite likely to purchase a product based on AI recommendations or endorsements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaya Dandey, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData, said: “Whether shoppers realise it or not, machine-learning systems have long been deciding when to encourage consumers to make purchases, which products they can see, and what discounts they can avail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, agentic systems can also complete shopping-related tasks end-to-end.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-computer-vision-and-store-automation"&gt;Computer vision and store automation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises evaluating computer vision and machine learning can observe early implementations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson, for example, introduced AI-enabled ‘Lawson Go’ stores in Japan during 2022. The retailer collaborated with technology provider CloudPick in 2025 to integrate AI, machine learning, and computer vision. This integration eliminates check-out lines and cashiers to enhance the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, retail AI company Fainders.AI launched a compact and cashier-less MicroStore inside a gym in 2024. This deployment improved the accessibility of autonomous retail across different businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI also aids the forecasting and automation of retail replenishment—a capability that applies well to the APAC market, where store footprints are small and replenishment frequency is high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese food retail chain Coop Sapporo uses a camera-based AI system named Sora-cam, developed by Soracom. The system helps the chain avoid overstocking and reduce unsold merchandise on store shelves. Coop Sapporo employs an analytics team to evaluate the generated images. The team determines the optimal shelf display ratio. The Sora-cam system also alerts staff members to apply discount labels on food items close to expiry to prevent wastage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI models track waste and markdown timing while improving promotion efficiency. In Southeast Asian (SEA) markets characterised by high price sensitivity, minor improvements in promotion efficiency increase profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-driven labour optimisation measures include scheduling, task priority lists, and workload balancing. These measures assist retailers in Japan and South Korea, which face structural labour shortages. They also provide efficiency benefits in high-growth SEA markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-agentic-ai-systems-in-retail-are-improving-apac-consumer-interaction"&gt;Agentic AI systems in retail are improving APAC consumer interaction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In food retail, agentic AI is best understood as an AI ‘operator’ that can understand a goal, plan steps, stay within budget or allergen constraints, execute actions across systems, ask clarifying questions, and learn preferences over time,” says Dandey.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers can bypass individual item searches by outlining their overall intent. A customer, for example, might request an AI agent to “Plan five dinners for a family of four, mostly Asian recipes, no shellfish, under 45 minutes.” The agent then generates recipes, builds a shopping cart, sizes quantities, and adds missing staples to the cart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This retail agentic AI capability aligns with regional behaviours, as many APAC households cook frequently and shop fresh. AI agents that recognise local cuisines – such as Korean banchan, Japanese bentos, and Indian spice bases – fit regional habits better than generic Western meal plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many APAC markets, shopping is already deeply integrated with digital wallets, messaging apps, ride-hailing, and delivery ecosystems, making it easier for agentic AI to plug into daily routines,” explains Dandey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nevertheless, some key challenges need to be overcome; ensuring private data sharing consent, minimising hallucinations in terms of allergens and ingredients, and implementing proper localisation of the system with language nuance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DBS pilots system that lets AI agents make payments for customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111908" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

OpenAI has traditionally focused on consumer users, for instance, while its rival Anthropic tends to target enterprises. Elon Musk’s xAI, we discovered recently, has been placing particular emphasis on video-game walkthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Friday, Business Insider’s Grace Kay published a detailed and far-reaching report about xAI, the AI startup recently acquired by SpaceX, with particular emphasis on how Musk is making life difficult for employees. But this particular anecdote stood out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game “Baldur’s Gate,” according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, you can imagine the frustration of any respected and experienced engineer who shows up to work thinking he’ll be tackling fundamental problems of knowledge and machine intelligence, only to be sidetracked into helping a 54-year-old man beat his video game. But the anecdote raises an even more pressing question: Did Musk end up getting the gaming skills he wanted?&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To answer that question, our resident RPG-enthusiast Ram Iyer put together a set of five general questions about Baldur’s Gate, which we ran against xAI and the three major models in a kind of quasi-benchmark that I’ve decided to call &lt;strong&gt;BaldurBench&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the interest of journalistic transparency, I’ve made all the chat transcripts public, so you can see them here: Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First, the good news: Grok actually gives pretty good information. Its responses were a bit dense with gamer jargon — “save-scumming” instead of saving and “DPS” instead of damage — but the answers were both useful and well-informed, provided you knew what it was talking about. Grok also really loves tables and theorycraft, which is about what you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are lots of Baldur’s Gate guides out there and the models were generally drawing from the same ones, so the biggest differences were stylistic. ChatGPT prefers bulleted lists and sentence fragments, while Gemini loves to &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; important words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The biggest surprise was Claude, which was particularly concerned about giving me information that would spoil my experience of the game. When I asked about good party compositions, it closed the guidance by saying “don’t stress too much and just play what sounds fun to you.” Thanks, Claude!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s important to bear in mind, this is a subject area we know (thanks to Business Insider’s reporting) that xAI has specifically focused on reaching parity. So we shouldn’t read too much into the fact that, after the reported sprint, Grok’s advice turned out about the same as the other models. Still, it’s nice to know xAI can make it work if it tries.&lt;/p&gt;
