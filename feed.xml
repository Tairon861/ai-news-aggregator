            &lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is changing the way businesses store and access their data. That’s because traditional data storage systems were designed to handle simple commands from a handful of users at once, whereas today, AI systems with millions of agents need to continuously access and process large amounts of data in parallel. Traditional data storage systems now have layers of complexity, which slows AI systems down because data must pass through multiple tiers before reaching the graphical processing units (GPUs) that are the brain cells of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian, co-founded by Michael Tso ’93, SM ’93 and Hiroshi Ohta, is helping storage keep up with the AI revolution. The company has developed a scalable storage system for businesses that helps data flow seamlessly between storage and AI models. The system reduces complexity by applying parallel computing to data storage, consolidating AI functions and data onto a single parallel-processing platform that stores, retrieves, and processes scalable datasets, with direct, high-speed transfers between storage and GPUs and CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian’s integrated storage-computing platform simplifies the process of building commercial-scale AI tools and gives businesses a storage foundation that can keep up with the rise of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things people miss about AI is that it’s all about the data,” Tso says. “You can’t get a 10 percent improvement in AI performance with 10 percent more data or even 10 times more data — you need 1,000 times more data. Being able to store that data in a way that’s easy to manage, and in such a way that you can embed computations into it so you can run operations while the data is coming in without moving the data — that’s where this industry is going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From MIT to industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at MIT in the 1990s, Tso was introduced by Professor William Dally to parallel computing — a type of computation in which many calculations occur simultaneously. Tso also worked on parallel computing with Associate Professor Greg Papadopoulos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was an incredible time because most schools had one super-computing project going on — MIT had four,” Tso recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, Tso worked with MIT senior research scientist David Clark, a computing pioneer who contributed to the internet’s early architecture, particularly the transmission control protocol (TCP) that delivers data between systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a graduate student at MIT, I worked on disconnected and intermittent networking operations for large scale distributed systems,” Tso says. “It’s funny — 30 years on, that’s what I’m still doing today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his graduation, Tso worked at Intel’s Architecture Lab, where he invented data synchronization algorithms used by Blackberry. He also created specifications for Nokia that ignited the ringtone download industry. He then joined Inktomi, a startup co-founded by Eric Brewer SM ’92, PhD ’94 that pioneered search and web content distribution technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Tso started Gemini Mobile Technologies with Joseph Norton ’93, SM ’93 and others. The company went on to build the world’s largest mobile messaging systems to handle the massive data growth from camera phones. Then, in the late 2000s, cloud computing became a powerful way for businesses to rent virtual servers as they grew their operations. Tso noticed the amount of data being collected was growing far faster than the speed of networking, so he decided to pivot the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Data is being created in a lot of different places, and that data has its own gravity: It’s going to cost you money and time to move it,” Tso explains. “That means the end state is a distributed cloud that reaches out to edge devices and servers. You have to bring the cloud to the data, not the data to the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tso officially launched Cloudian out of Gemini Mobile Technologies in 2012, with a new emphasis on helping customers with scalable, distributed, cloud-compatible data storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we didn’t see when we first started the company was that AI was going to be the ultimate use case for data on the edge,” Tso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Tso’s research at MIT began more than two decades ago, he sees strong connections between what he worked on and the industry today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like my whole life is playing back because David Clark and I were dealing with disconnected and intermittently connected networks, which are part of every edge use case today, and Professor Dally was working on very fast, scalable interconnects,” Tso says, noting that Dally is now the senior vice president and chief scientist at the leading AI company NVIDIA. “Now, when you look at the modern NVIDIA chip architecture and the way they do interchip communication, it’s got Dally’s work all over it. With Professor Papadopoulos, I worked on accelerate application software with parallel computing hardware without having to rewrite the applications, and that’s exactly the problem we are trying to solve with NVIDIA. Coincidentally, all the stuff I was doing at MIT is playing out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Cloudian’s platform uses an object storage architecture in which all kinds of data —documents, videos, sensor data — are stored as a unique object with metadata. Object storage can manage massive datasets in a flat file stucture, making it ideal for unstructured data and AI systems, but it traditionally hasn’t been able to send data directly to AI models without the data first being copied into a computer’s memory system, creating latency and energy bottlenecks for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Cloudian announced that it has extended its object storage system with a vector database that stores data in a form which is immediately usable by AI models. As the data are ingested, Cloudian is computing in real-time the vector form of that data to power AI tools like recommender engines, search, and AI assistants. Cloudian also announced a partnership with NVIDIA that allows its storage system to work directly with the AI company’s GPUs. Cloudian says the new system enables even faster AI operations and reduces computing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NVIDIA contacted us about a year and a half ago because GPUs are useful only with data that keeps them busy,” Tso says. “Now that people are realizing it’s easier to move the AI to the data than it is to move huge datasets. Our storage systems embed a lot of AI functions, so we’re able to pre- and post-process data for AI near where we collect and store the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-first storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian is helping about 1,000 companies around the world get more value out of their data, including large manufacturers, financial service providers, health care organizations, and government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian’s storage platform is helping one large automaker, for instance, use AI to determine when each of its manufacturing robots need to be serviced. Cloudian is also working with the National Library of Medicine to store research articles and patents, and the National Cancer Database to store DNA sequences of tumors — rich datasets that AI models could process to help research develop new treatments or gain new insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GPUs have been an incredible enabler,” Tso says. “Moore’s Law doubles the amount of compute every two years, but GPUs are able to parallelize operations on chips, so you can network GPUs together and shatter Moore’s Law. That scale is pushing AI to new levels of intelligence, but the only way to make GPUs work hard is to feed them data at the same speed that they compute — and the only way to do that is to get rid of all the layers between them and your data.”&lt;/p&gt;

Its Apple Intelligence features – shown off at WWDC – won’t reach most users until at least 2025 or even 2026. Some see this as Apple falling behind, but the company’s track record suggests it prefers to launch only when products are ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, competitors like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google have already shipped AI features widely – often with bugs and unreliable results, and usually whether or not users ask for them. AI assistants today still struggle with accuracy, consistency, and usefulness in many tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple seems to be watching from the sidelines, waiting for the tech to mature. Instead of flooding iOS with half-working tools, it’s holding back. That strategy may pay off if users lose patience with AI that overpromises and underdelivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has done this before – launching smartwatches and tablets late, but with stronger products. And since it already owns the hardware and software, and controls its own app store, it can afford to wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If current AI tools don’t improve soon, Apple’s slower, more cautious rollout might look less like hesitation and more like smart planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That measured approach doesn’t mean Apple is sitting still. Behind the scenes, the company is ramping up investment, hiring, and internal coordination to prepare for an AI shift. That strategy was on full display during a recent all-hands meeting at Apple’s headquarters, where CEO Tim Cook rallied employees and laid out the company’s AI ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is getting serious about artificial intelligence, and Cook wants everyone at the company on board. As reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, during a rare all-company gathering at its Cupertino HQ, he spoke directly to employees about what’s next. His message was clear: Apple has to win in AI – and now is the time to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook called AI a once-in-a-generation shift, comparing its impact to that of the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing. “Apple must do this. Apple will do this. This is sort of ours to grab,” he said, according to people who were there. He promised Apple would spend what it takes to compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has been slower than others to roll out AI tools. Apple Intelligence – its main AI offering – was introduced long after companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft launched its own products. And even when Apple finally announced its plans, the reaction was underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Why Apple is playing it slow with AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cook pointed out that Apple has often shown up late to new technology – only to redefine it. “There was a PC before the Mac; there was a smartphone before the iPhone,” he reminded employees. “There were many tablets before the iPad.” Apple didn’t invent those categories, he said, it just made them work better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building the future of Siri&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the company’s current AI work centres on Siri, its voice assistant. Apple had originally planned a major overhaul as part of Apple Intelligence, adding features powered by large language models. But that rollout was delayed, leading to internal shakeups and a rethink of the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, told employees that trying to merge old and new versions of Siri didn’t work. The team tried to keep the original system for basic tasks like setting timers, while adding generative AI features for more complex requests. But that hybrid setup didn’t meet Apple’s standards. “We realised that approach wasn’t going to get us to Apple quality,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the team is rebuilding Siri from the ground up. A completely new version is in the works, expected as early as spring 2026. Federighi said the results so far have been strong and could lead to more improvements than originally planned. “There is no project people are taking more seriously,” he told staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key figure behind this new direction is Mike Rockwell, the executive who led development on Apple’s Vision Pro headset. Rockwell and his software team are now leading Siri’s redesign. Federighi said they’ve “supercharged” the work and brought a new level of focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Investing in AI talent and tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is also expanding its AI team quickly. Cook said the company hired 12,000 people in the past year, with 40% of them joining research and development, with many of those hires are focused on AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the work involves hardware. Apple is building new chips specifically designed for AI, including a more powerful server chip known internally as “Baltra.” The company is also opening an AI server farm in Houston to support future projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Siri, Apple is quietly building what could become a major AI tool. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;‘s Mark Gurman, Apple has formed a team called “Answers, Knowledge, and Information” (AKI). The group’s job is to create search that works more like ChatGPT – giving direct answers rather than just showing links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AKI team is led by Robby Walker, who reports to AI chief John Giannandrea, and Apple has already started hiring engineers for the group. While details are still limited, the project appears to include backend systems, search algorithms, and potentially even a standalone app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A push to move faster&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook also encouraged employees to start using AI more in their work. “All of us are using AI in a significant way already, and we must use it as a company as well,” he said. He told employees to bring ideas to their managers and find ways to get AI tools into products faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sense of urgency was echoed during Apple’s recent earnings call. The company posted strong results, with nearly 10% growth in the June quarter – enough to ease concerns about slowing iPhone sales and weak results from the Chinese market. Cook told investors Apple would “significantly” increase its spending on AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet challenges remain. Apple expects to face a $1.1 billion hit from tariffs this quarter and continues to deal with antitrust pressures in the US and Europe, where regulators are watching closely to see how the company runs its App Store and handles user data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook acknowledged these issues at the staff meeting, saying Apple would continue pushing regulators to adopt rules that don’t hurt privacy or user experience. “We need to continue to push on the intention of the regulation,” he said, “instead of these things that destroy the user experience and user privacy and security.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New stores, new markets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond AI, Cook touched on Apple’s retail strategy. The company plans to open new stores in emerging markets, including India, the United Arab Emirates, and China. A store in Saudi Arabia is also on the way. Apple is also putting more focus on its online store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be in more countries,” Cook said, adding that most of Apple’s future growth will come from new markets. That doesn’t mean existing regions will be ignored, but the company sees more opportunity in expanding its global footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s next for Apple products&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Cook didn’t reveal any product details, he said, “I have never felt so much excitement and so much energy before as right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports suggest Apple is working on several new devices, including a foldable iPhone, new smart glasses, updated home devices, and robotics. A major iPhone redesign is also rumoured for its 20th anniversary next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook didn’t confirm any of this, but he hinted at big things ahead. “The product pipeline, which I can’t talk about: It’s amazing, guys. It’s amazing,” he said. “Some of it you’ll see soon, some of it will come later, but there’s a lot to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cautious but confident&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple’s cautious approach to AI may have slowed it down, but internally, the company seems to believe that slow and steady might win the race. Cook’s message to employees was clear: Apple can still define what useful, responsible AI looks like – and it’s all hands on deck to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by: Apple via YouTube)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Federighi said they’ve “supercharged” the work and brought a new level of focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Investing in AI talent and tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is also expanding its AI team quickly. Cook said the company hired 12,000 people in the past year, with 40% of them joining research and development, with many of those hires are focused on AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the work involves hardware. Apple is building new chips specifically designed for AI, including a more powerful server chip known internally as “Baltra.” The company is also opening an AI server farm in Houston to support future projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Siri, Apple is quietly building what could become a major AI tool. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;‘s Mark Gurman, Apple has formed a team called “Answers, Knowledge, and Information” (AKI). The group’s job is to create search that works more like ChatGPT – giving direct answers rather than just showing links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AKI team is led by Robby Walker, who reports to AI chief John Giannandrea, and Apple has already started hiring engineers for the group. While details are still limited, the project appears to include backend systems, search algorithms, and potentially even a standalone app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A push to move faster&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook also encouraged employees to start using AI more in their work. “All of us are using AI in a significant way already, and we must use it as a company as well,” he said. He told employees to bring ideas to their managers and find ways to get AI tools into products faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sense of urgency was echoed during Apple’s recent earnings call. The company posted strong results, with nearly 10% growth in the June quarter – enough to ease concerns about slowing iPhone sales and weak results from the Chinese market. Cook told investors Apple would “significantly” increase its spending on AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet challenges remain. Apple expects to face a $1.1 billion hit from tariffs this quarter and continues to deal with antitrust pressures in the US and Europe, where regulators are watching closely to see how the company runs its App Store and handles user data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook acknowledged these issues at the staff meeting, saying Apple would continue pushing regulators to adopt rules that don’t hurt privacy or user experience. “We need to continue to push on the intention of the regulation,” he said, “instead of these things that destroy the user experience and user privacy and security.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New stores, new markets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond AI, Cook touched on Apple’s retail strategy. The company plans to open new stores in emerging markets, including India, the United Arab Emirates, and China. A store in Saudi Arabia is also on the way. Apple is also putting more focus on its online store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be in more countries,” Cook said, adding that most of Apple’s future growth will come from new markets. That doesn’t mean existing regions will be ignored, but the company sees more opportunity in expanding its global footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s next for Apple products&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Cook didn’t reveal any product details, he said, “I have never felt so much excitement and so much energy before as right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports suggest Apple is working on several new devices, including a foldable iPhone, new smart glasses, updated home devices, and robotics. A major iPhone redesign is also rumoured for its 20th anniversary next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook didn’t confirm any of this, but he hinted at big things ahead. “The product pipeline, which I can’t talk about: It’s amazing, guys. It’s amazing,” he said. “Some of it you’ll see soon, some of it will come later, but there’s a lot to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cautious but confident&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple’s cautious approach to AI may have slowed it down, but internally, the company seems to believe that slow and steady might win the race. Cook’s message to employees was clear: Apple can still define what useful, responsible AI looks like – and it’s all hands on deck to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by: Apple via YouTube)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last year, French privacy-focused search engine Qwant struck a joint venture with German non-profit search engine Ecosia, to develop a European search index. Called European Search Perspective (EUSP), the JV now aims to serve around 50% of French queries and 33% of German queries by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Qwant said it is using the new index to power some of its features, like AI summaries for search, and Ecosia has plans to add some AI features soon to its platform, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;EUSP is also in talks with companies to spur the adoption of its index for enabling search within apps. Notably, it is targeting chatbots, presenting Staan as a cheaper alternative to Google and Bing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you’re using ChatGPT or any other AI chatbot, they all do knowledge grounding with web search […] our index can power deep research and AI summary features. Google and Bing’s solutions are also pricey, and our index can offer power search features at a tenth of the cost,” Christian Kroll, CEO of Ecosia, told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;EUSP, like Proton, is pushing to develop a European tech stack that doesn’t rely on technology from the U.S. or China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The timing could not be more urgent. The outcome of the 2024 U.S. election has reminded European policymakers and innovators just how exposed Europe remains when it comes to core digital infrastructure. Much of Europe’s search, cloud, and AI layers are built on American Big Tech stacks, putting entire sectors – from journalism to climate tech – at the mercy of political or commercial agendas,” the companies said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

With missions beyond Earth orbit in sight, a NASA-led competition is hoping to change all that and usher in a new era of sustainable space food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve the problem of feeding astronauts on long-duration missions, NASA asked companies to propose novel ways to develop sustainable foods for future missions. Around 200 rose to the challenge—creating nutritious (and outlandish) culinary creations in the process.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said in a blog post that gpt‑oss-20b is “tool-savvy and lightweight,” adding: “Optimized for agentic tasks like code execution and tool use, it runs efficiently on a range of Windows hardware, with support for more devices coming soon. It’s perfect for building autonomous assistants or embedding AI into real-world workflows, even in bandwidth-constrained environments.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Launched on Tuesday, OpenAI’s gpt-oss-20b can run on consumer PCs and laptops with at least 16GB of VRAM, which a modern GPU from Nvidia or Radeon would have. OpenAI said the model was trained using high-compute reinforcement learning, which helps it excel at powering AI agents and call tools, such as web search or Python code execution, as part of its chain-of-thought process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the model is text-only, meaning it will not be able to process or generate images and audio like the company’s other models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also, the model has a habit of hallucinating a lot: gpt-oss-20b hallucinated in response to 53% of questions on PersonQA, OpenAI’s in-house benchmark for measuring the accuracy of a model’s knowledge about people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft says it will bring the model to macOS soon, as well as other devices, though the company did not name any more. Microsoft is also making both gpt-oss-20b and older model gpt-oss-120b available via its hosted Azure AI Foundry platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The two new models are also available on Amazon’s AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
