Babies Milayah and Rossouw arrived a few weeks ago. All babies are special, but these two set a new precedent. They’re the first to be born following "simplified" IVF performed in a mobile lab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This new mobile lab is essentially a trailer crammed with everything an embryologist needs to perform IVF on a shoestring. It was designed to deliver reproductive treatments to people who live in rural parts of low-income countries, where IVF can be prohibitively expensive or even nonexistent. And it seems to work!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While IVF is increasingly commonplace in wealthy countries&lt;/strong&gt;—around 12% of all births in Spain result from such procedures—it remains expensive and isn’t always covered by insurance or national health providers. And it’s even less accessible in low-income countries—especially for people who live in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People often assume that countries with high birth rates don’t need access to fertility treatments, says Gerhard Boshoff, an embryologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. Sub-Saharan African countries like Niger, Angola, and Benin all have birth rates above 40 per 1,000 people, which is&amp;nbsp;over four times the rates in Italy and Japan, for example.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But that doesn’t mean people in Sub-Saharan Africa don’t need IVF.&lt;/strong&gt; Globally, around&amp;nbsp;one in six adults experience infertility at some point in their lives, according to the World Health Organization. Research by the organization suggests that infertility rates are similar in high-income and low-income countries. As&amp;nbsp;the WHO’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus puts it: “Infertility does not discriminate.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many people in rural areas of low-income countries, IVF clinics simply don’t exist. South Africa is considered a “reproductive hub” of the African continent, but even in that country there&amp;nbsp;are fewer than 30 clinics for a population of over 60 million. A&amp;nbsp;recent study found there were no such clinics in Angola or Malawi.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willem Ombelet, a retired gynecologist, first noticed these disparities back in the 1980s, while he was working at an IVF lab in Pretoria.&lt;/strong&gt; “I witnessed that infertility was [more prevalent] in the black population than the white population—but they couldn’t access IVF because of apartheid,” he says. The experience spurred him to find ways to make IVF accessible for everyone. In the 1990s, he launched&amp;nbsp;The Walking Egg—a science and art project with that goal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2008, Ombelet met Jonathan Van Blerkom, a reproductive biologist and embryologist who had already been experimenting with a simplified version of IVF. Typically, embryos are cultured in an incubator that provides a sterile mix of gases. Van Blerkom’s approach was to preload tubes with the required gases and seal them with a rubber stopper. “We don’t need a fancy lab,” says Ombelet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="a sleeping infant in a hat and fuzzy sweater" class="wp-image-1120005" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Baby-1.jpg?w=1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Milayah was born on June 18.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE WALKING EGG&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eggs and sperm can be injected into the tubes through the stoppers, and the resulting embryos can be grown inside. All you really need is a good microscope and a way to keep the tube warm, says Ombelet. Once the embryos are around five days old, they can be transferred to a person’s uterus or frozen. “The cost is one tenth or one twentieth of a normal lab,” says Ombelet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ombelet, Van Blerkom, and their colleagues found that this approach appeared to work as well as regular IVF. &lt;/strong&gt;The team ran their first pilot trial at a clinic in Belgium in 2012. The first babies conceived with the simplified IVF process&amp;nbsp;were born later that year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Boshoff wondered if the team could take the show on the road. Making IVF simpler and cheaper is one thing, but getting it to people who don’t have access to IVF care is another. What if the team could pack the simplified IVF lab into a trailer and drive it around rural South Africa?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We just needed to figure out how to have everything in a very confined space,” says Boshoff.&lt;/strong&gt; As part of the Walking Egg project, he and his colleagues found a way to organize the lab equipment and squeeze in air filters. He then designed a “fold-out system” that allowed the team to create a second room when the trailer was parked. This provides some privacy for people who are having embryos transferred, he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People who want to use the mobile IVF lab will first have to undergo treatment at a local medical facility, where they will take drugs that stimulate their ovaries to release eggs, and then have those eggs collected. The rest of the process can be done in the mobile lab, says Boshoff, who presented his work at&amp;nbsp;the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology’s annual meeting in Paris earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first trial started last year. &lt;/strong&gt;The team partnered with one of the few existing fertility clinics in rural South Africa, which put them in touch with 10 willing volunteers. Five of the 10 women got pregnant following their simplified IVF in the mobile lab. One miscarried, but four pregnancies continued. On June 18, baby Milayah arrived. Two days later, another mother welcomed baby Rossouw. The other babies could come any day now.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’ve proven that a very cheap and easy [IVF] method can be used even in a mobile unit and have comparable results to regular IVF,” says Ombelet, who says his team is planning similar trials in Egypt and Indonesia. “The next step is to roll it out all over the world.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

But the global early warning system that alerts security teams to dangerous software flaws is showing critical gaps in coverage—and most users have no idea their digital lives are likely becoming more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the past 18 months, two pillars of global cybersecurity have flirted with apparent collapse. In February 2024, the US-backed National Vulnerability Database (NVD)—relied on globally for its free analysis of security threats—abruptly stopped publishing new entries, citing a cryptic “change in interagency support.” Then, in April of this year, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, the fundamental numbering system for tracking software flaws, seemed at similar risk: A leaked letter warned of an imminent contract expiration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity practitioners have since flooded Discord channels and LinkedIn feeds with emergency posts and memes of “NVD” and “CVE” engraved on tombstones. Unpatched vulnerabilities are the second most common way cyberattackers break in, and they have led to fatal hospital outages and critical infrastructure failures. In a social media post, Jen Easterly, a US cybersecurity expert, said: “Losing [CVE] would be like tearing out the card catalog from every library at once—leaving defenders to sort through chaos while attackers take full advantage.” If CVEs identify each vulnerability like a book in a card catalogue, NVD entries provide the detailed review with context around severity, scope, and exploitability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) extended funding for CVE another year, attributing the incident to a “contract administration issue.” But the NVD’s story has proved more complicated. Its parent organization, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), reportedly saw its budget cut roughly 12% in 2024, right around the time that CISA pulled its $3.7 million in annual funding for the NVD. Shortly after, as the backlog grew, CISA launched its own “Vulnrichment” program to help address the analysis gap, while promoting a more distributed approach that allows multiple authorized partners to publish enriched data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“CISA continuously assesses how to most effectively allocate limited resources to help organizations reduce the risk of newly disclosed vulnerabilities,” says Sandy Radesky, the agency’s associate director for vulnerability management. Rather than just filling the gap, she emphasizes, Vulnrichment was established to provide unique additional information, like recommended actions for specific stakeholders, and to “reduce dependency of the federal government’s role to be the sole provider of vulnerability enrichment.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, NIST has scrambled to hire contractors to help clear the backlog. Despite a return to pre-crisis processing levels, a boom in vulnerabilities newly disclosed to the NVD has outpaced these efforts. Currently, over 25,000 vulnerabilities await processing—nearly 10 times the previous high in 2017, according to data from the software company Anchore. Before that, the NVD largely kept pace with CVE publications, maintaining a minimal backlog.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Things have been disruptive, and we’ve been going through times of change across the board,” Matthew Scholl, then chief of the computer security division in NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory, said at an industry event in April. “Leadership has assured me and everyone that NVD is and will continue to be a mission priority for NIST, both in resourcing and capabilities.” Scholl left NIST in May after 20 years at the agency, and NIST declined to comment on the backlog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The situation has now prompted multiple government actions, with the Department of Commerce launching an audit of the NVD in May and House Democrats calling for a broader probe of both programs in June. But the damage to trust is already transforming geopolitics and supply chains as security teams prepare for a new era of cyber risk. “It’s left a bad taste, and people are realizing they can’t rely on this,” says Rose Gupta, who builds and runs enterprise vulnerability management programs. “Even if they get everything together tomorrow with a bigger budget, I don’t know that this won’t happen again. So I have to make sure I have other controls in place.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As these public resources falter, organizations and governments are confronting a critical weakness in our digital infrastructure: Essential global cybersecurity services depend on a complex web of US agency interests and government funding that can be cut or redirected at any time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security haves and have-nots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What began as a trickle of software vulnerabilities in the early Internet era has become an unstoppable avalanche, and the free databases that have tracked them for decades have struggled to keep up. In early July, the CVE database crossed over 300,000 catalogued vulnerabilities. Numbers jump unpredictably each year, sometimes by 10% or much more. Even before its latest crisis, the NVD was notorious for delayed publication of new vulnerability analyses, often trailing private security software and vendor advisories by weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gupta has watched organizations increasingly adopt commercial vulnerability management (VM) software that includes its own threat intelligence services. “We’ve definitely become over-reliant on our VM tools,” she says, describing security teams’ growing dependence on vendors like Qualys, Rapid7, and Tenable to supplement or replace unreliable public databases. These platforms combine their own research with various data sources to create proprietary risk scores that help teams prioritize fixes. But not all organizations can afford to fill the NVD’s gap with premium security tools. “Smaller companies and startups, already at a disadvantage, are going to be more at risk,” she explains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Komal Rawat, a security engineer in New Delhi whose mid-stage cloud startup has a limited budget, describes the impact in stark terms: “If NVD goes, there will be a crisis in the market. Other databases are not that popular, and to the extent they are adopted, they are not free. If you don’t have recent data, you’re exposed to attackers who do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The growing backlog means new devices could be more likely to have vulnerability blind spots—whether that’s a Ring doorbell at home or an office building’s “smart” access control system. The biggest risk may be “one-off” security flaws that fly under the radar. “There are thousands of vulnerabilities that will not affect the majority of enterprises,” says Gupta. “Those are the ones that we’re not getting analysis on, which would leave us at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NIST acknowledges it has limited visibility into which organizations are most affected by the backlog. “We don’t track which industries use which products and therefore cannot measure impact to specific industries,” a spokesperson says. Instead, the team prioritizes vulnerabilities on the basis of CISA’s known exploits list and those included in vendor advisories like Microsoft Patch Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Brian Martin has watched this system evolve—and deteriorate—from the inside. A former CVE board member and an original project leader behind the Open Source Vulnerability Database, he has built a combative reputation over the decades as a leading historian and practitioner. Martin says his current project, VulnDB (part of Flashpoint Security), outperforms the official databases he once helped oversee. “Our team processes more vulnerabilities, at a much faster turnaround, and we do it for a fraction of the cost," he says, referring to the tens of millions in government contracts that support the current system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we spoke in May, Martin said his database contains more than 112,000 vulnerabilities with no CVE identifiers—security flaws that exist in the wild but remain invisible to organizations that rely solely on public channels. “If you gave me the money to triple my team, that non-CVE number would be in the 500,000 range,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the US, official vulnerability management duties are split between a web of contractors, agencies, and nonprofit centers like the Mitre Corporation. Critics like Martin say&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that creates potential for redundancy, confusion, and inefficiency, with layers of middle management and relatively few actual vulnerability experts. Others defend the value of this fragmentation. “These programs build on or complement each other to create a more comprehensive, supportive, and diverse community,” CISA said in a statement. “That increases the resilience and usefulness of the entire ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As American leadership wavers, other nations are stepping up. China now operates multiple vulnerability databases, some surprisingly robust but tainted by the possibility that they are subject to state control. In May, the European Union accelerated the launch of its own database, as well as a decentralized “Global CVE” architecture. Following social media and cloud services, vulnerability intelligence has become another front in the contest for technological independence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That leaves security professionals to navigate multiple potentially conflicting sources of data. “It’s going to be a mess, but I would rather have too much information than none at all,” says Gupta, describing how her team monitors multiple databases despite the added complexity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resetting software liability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As defenders adapt to the fragmenting landscape, the tech industry faces another reckoning: Why don’t software vendors carry more responsibility for protecting their customers from security issues? Major vendors routinely disclose—but don’t necessarily patch—thousands of new vulnerabilities each year. A single exposure could crash critical systems or increase the risks of fraud and data misuse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For decades, the industry has hidden behind legal shields. “Shrink-wrap licenses” once forced consumers to broadly waive their right to hold software vendors liable for defects. Today’s end-user license agreements (EULAs), often delivered in pop-up browser windows, have evolved into incomprehensibly long documents. Last November, a lab project called “EULAS of Despair” used the length of &lt;em&gt;War and Peace&lt;/em&gt; (587,287 words) to measure these sprawling contracts. The worst offender? Twitter, at 15.83 novels’ worth of fine print.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This is a legal fiction that we’ve created around this whole ecosystem, and it’s just not sustainable,” says Andrea Matwyshyn, a US special advisor and technology law professor at Penn State University, where she directs the Policy Innovation Lab of Tomorrow. “Some people point to the fact that software can contain a mix of products and services, creating more complex facts. But just like in engineering or financial litigation, even the most messy scenarios can be resolved with the assistance of experts.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This liability shield is finally beginning to crack. In July 2024, a faulty security update in CrowdStrike’s popular endpoint detection software crashed millions of Windows computers worldwide and caused outages at everything from airlines to hospitals to 911 systems. The incident led to billions in estimated damages, and the city of Portland, Oregon, even declared a “state of emergency.” Now, affected companies like Delta Airlines have hired high-priced attorneys to pursue major damages—a signal opening of the floodgates to litigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the soaring number of vulnerabilities, many fall into long-established categories, such as SQL injections that interfere with database queries and buffer memory overflows that enable code to be executed remotely. Matwyshyn advocates for a mandatory “software bill of materials,” or S-BOM—an ingredients list that would let organizations understand what components and potential vulnerabilities exist throughout their software supply chains. One recent report found 30% of data breaches stemmed from the vulnerabilities of third-party software vendors or cloud service providers.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;She adds: “When you can’t tell the difference between the companies that are cutting corners and a company that has really invested in doing right by their customers, that results in a market where everyone loses.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CISA leadership shares this sentiment, with a spokesperson emphasizing its “secure-by-design principles,” such as “making essential security features available without additional cost, eliminating classes of vulnerabilities, and building products in a way that reduces the cybersecurity burden on customers.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding a digital ‘dark age’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It will likely come as no surprise that practitioners are looking to AI to help fill the gap, while at the same time preparing for a coming swarm of cyberattacks by AI agents. Security researchers have used an OpenAI model to discover new “zero-day” vulnerabilities. And both the NVD and CVE teams are developing “AI-powered tools” to help streamline data collection, identification, and processing. NIST says that “up to 65% of our analysis time has been spent generating CPEs”—product information codes that pinpoint affected software. If AI can solve even part of this tedious process, it could dramatically speed up the analysis pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Martin cautions against optimism around AI, noting that the technology remains unproven and often riddled with inaccuracies—which, in security, can be fatal. “Rather than AI or ML [machine learning], there are ways to strategically automate bits of the processing of that vulnerability data while ensuring 99.5% accuracy,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI also fails to address more fundamental challenges in governance. The CVE Foundation, launched in April 2025 by breakaway board members, proposes a globally funded nonprofit model similar to that of the internet’s addressing system, which transitioned from US government control to international governance. Other security leaders are pushing to revitalize open-source alternatives like Google’s OSV Project or the NVD++ (maintained by VulnCheck), which are accessible to the public but currently have limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As these various reform efforts gain momentum, the world is waking up to the fact that vulnerability intelligence—like disease surveillance or aviation safety—requires sustained cooperation and public investment. Without it, a patchwork of paid databases will be all that remains, threatening to leave all but the richest organizations and nations permanently exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew King is a technology and environmental journalist based in New York.

But the global early warning system that alerts security teams to dangerous software flaws is showing critical gaps in coverage—and most users have no idea their digital lives are likely becoming more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the past 18 months, two pillars of global cybersecurity have flirted with apparent collapse. In February 2024, the US-backed National Vulnerability Database (NVD)—relied on globally for its free analysis of security threats—abruptly stopped publishing new entries, citing a cryptic “change in interagency support.” Then, in April of this year, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, the fundamental numbering system for tracking software flaws, seemed at similar risk: A leaked letter warned of an imminent contract expiration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity practitioners have since flooded Discord channels and LinkedIn feeds with emergency posts and memes of “NVD” and “CVE” engraved on tombstones. Unpatched vulnerabilities are the second most common way cyberattackers break in, and they have led to fatal hospital outages and critical infrastructure failures. In a social media post, Jen Easterly, a US cybersecurity expert, said: “Losing [CVE] would be like tearing out the card catalog from every library at once—leaving defenders to sort through chaos while attackers take full advantage.” If CVEs identify each vulnerability like a book in a card catalogue, NVD entries provide the detailed review with context around severity, scope, and exploitability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) extended funding for CVE another year, attributing the incident to a “contract administration issue.” But the NVD’s story has proved more complicated. Its parent organization, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), reportedly saw its budget cut roughly 12% in 2024, right around the time that CISA pulled its $3.7 million in annual funding for the NVD. Shortly after, as the backlog grew, CISA launched its own “Vulnrichment” program to help address the analysis gap, while promoting a more distributed approach that allows multiple authorized partners to publish enriched data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“CISA continuously assesses how to most effectively allocate limited resources to help organizations reduce the risk of newly disclosed vulnerabilities,” says Sandy Radesky, the agency’s associate director for vulnerability management. Rather than just filling the gap, she emphasizes, Vulnrichment was established to provide unique additional information, like recommended actions for specific stakeholders, and to “reduce dependency of the federal government’s role to be the sole provider of vulnerability enrichment.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, NIST has scrambled to hire contractors to help clear the backlog. Despite a return to pre-crisis processing levels, a boom in vulnerabilities newly disclosed to the NVD has outpaced these efforts. Currently, over 25,000 vulnerabilities await processing—nearly 10 times the previous high in 2017, according to data from the software company Anchore. Before that, the NVD largely kept pace with CVE publications, maintaining a minimal backlog.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Things have been disruptive, and we’ve been going through times of change across the board,” Matthew Scholl, then chief of the computer security division in NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory, said at an industry event in April. “Leadership has assured me and everyone that NVD is and will continue to be a mission priority for NIST, both in resourcing and capabilities.” Scholl left NIST in May after 20 years at the agency, and NIST declined to comment on the backlog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The situation has now prompted multiple government actions, with the Department of Commerce launching an audit of the NVD in May and House Democrats calling for a broader probe of both programs in June. But the damage to trust is already transforming geopolitics and supply chains as security teams prepare for a new era of cyber risk. “It’s left a bad taste, and people are realizing they can’t rely on this,” says Rose Gupta, who builds and runs enterprise vulnerability management programs. “Even if they get everything together tomorrow with a bigger budget, I don’t know that this won’t happen again. So I have to make sure I have other controls in place.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As these public resources falter, organizations and governments are confronting a critical weakness in our digital infrastructure: Essential global cybersecurity services depend on a complex web of US agency interests and government funding that can be cut or redirected at any time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security haves and have-nots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What began as a trickle of software vulnerabilities in the early Internet era has become an unstoppable avalanche, and the free databases that have tracked them for decades have struggled to keep up. In early July, the CVE database crossed over 300,000 catalogued vulnerabilities. Numbers jump unpredictably each year, sometimes by 10% or much more. Even before its latest crisis, the NVD was notorious for delayed publication of new vulnerability analyses, often trailing private security software and vendor advisories by weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gupta has watched organizations increasingly adopt commercial vulnerability management (VM) software that includes its own threat intelligence services. “We’ve definitely become over-reliant on our VM tools,” she says, describing security teams’ growing dependence on vendors like Qualys, Rapid7, and Tenable to supplement or replace unreliable public databases. These platforms combine their own research with various data sources to create proprietary risk scores that help teams prioritize fixes. But not all organizations can afford to fill the NVD’s gap with premium security tools. “Smaller companies and startups, already at a disadvantage, are going to be more at risk,” she explains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Komal Rawat, a security engineer in New Delhi whose mid-stage cloud startup has a limited budget, describes the impact in stark terms: “If NVD goes, there will be a crisis in the market. Other databases are not that popular, and to the extent they are adopted, they are not free. If you don’t have recent data, you’re exposed to attackers who do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The growing backlog means new devices could be more likely to have vulnerability blind spots—whether that’s a Ring doorbell at home or an office building’s “smart” access control system. The biggest risk may be “one-off” security flaws that fly under the radar. “There are thousands of vulnerabilities that will not affect the majority of enterprises,” says Gupta. “Those are the ones that we’re not getting analysis on, which would leave us at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NIST acknowledges it has limited visibility into which organizations are most affected by the backlog. “We don’t track which industries use which products and therefore cannot measure impact to specific industries,” a spokesperson says. Instead, the team prioritizes vulnerabilities on the basis of CISA’s known exploits list and those included in vendor advisories like Microsoft Patch Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Brian Martin has watched this system evolve—and deteriorate—from the inside. A former CVE board member and an original project leader behind the Open Source Vulnerability Database, he has built a combative reputation over the decades as a leading historian and practitioner. Martin says his current project, VulnDB (part of Flashpoint Security), outperforms the official databases he once helped oversee. “Our team processes more vulnerabilities, at a much faster turnaround, and we do it for a fraction of the cost," he says, referring to the tens of millions in government contracts that support the current system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we spoke in May, Martin said his database contains more than 112,000 vulnerabilities with no CVE identifiers—security flaws that exist in the wild but remain invisible to organizations that rely solely on public channels. “If you gave me the money to triple my team, that non-CVE number would be in the 500,000 range,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the US, official vulnerability management duties are split between a web of contractors, agencies, and nonprofit centers like the Mitre Corporation. Critics like Martin say&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that creates potential for redundancy, confusion, and inefficiency, with layers of middle management and relatively few actual vulnerability experts. Others defend the value of this fragmentation. “These programs build on or complement each other to create a more comprehensive, supportive, and diverse community,” CISA said in a statement. “That increases the resilience and usefulness of the entire ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As American leadership wavers, other nations are stepping up. China now operates multiple vulnerability databases, some surprisingly robust but tainted by the possibility that they are subject to state control. In May, the European Union accelerated the launch of its own database, as well as a decentralized “Global CVE” architecture. Following social media and cloud services, vulnerability intelligence has become another front in the contest for technological independence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That leaves security professionals to navigate multiple potentially conflicting sources of data. “It’s going to be a mess, but I would rather have too much information than none at all,” says Gupta, describing how her team monitors multiple databases despite the added complexity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resetting software liability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As defenders adapt to the fragmenting landscape, the tech industry faces another reckoning: Why don’t software vendors carry more responsibility for protecting their customers from security issues? Major vendors routinely disclose—but don’t necessarily patch—thousands of new vulnerabilities each year. A single exposure could crash critical systems or increase the risks of fraud and data misuse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For decades, the industry has hidden behind legal shields. “Shrink-wrap licenses” once forced consumers to broadly waive their right to hold software vendors liable for defects.

The system promises “99.9999% uptime” – a figure that translates to less than 32 seconds of unplanned downtime per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents what IBM calls “the most resilient server in the history of the IBM Power platform.” For non-technical readers, this level of reliability means that critical business applications – from banking transactions to healthcare records – can operate continuously without interruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zero-planned downtime feature allows system maintenance, updates, and patches while applications continue running, eliminating the traditional maintenance windows that typically require taking systems offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/202505_Power11_Mahaney_ATX_E1150-LS1_0975-1024x683.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-integration-made-practical"&gt;AI integration made practical&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The servers include on-chip acceleration for AI inference – the process of using trained AI models to make predictions or decisions in real-time business scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system will support IBM’s upcoming Spyre Accelerator, a specialised chip designed for AI-intensive workloads, expected in Q4 2025.

The system promises “99.9999% uptime” – a figure that translates to less than 32 seconds of unplanned downtime per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents what IBM calls “the most resilient server in the history of the IBM Power platform.” For non-technical readers, this level of reliability means that critical business applications – from banking transactions to healthcare records – can operate continuously without interruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zero-planned downtime feature allows system maintenance, updates, and patches while applications continue running, eliminating the traditional maintenance windows that typically require taking systems offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/202505_Power11_Mahaney_ATX_E1150-LS1_0975-1024x683.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-integration-made-practical"&gt;AI integration made practical&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The servers include on-chip acceleration for AI inference – the process of using trained AI models to make predictions or decisions in real-time business scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system will support IBM’s upcoming Spyre Accelerator, a specialised chip designed for AI-intensive workloads, expected in Q4 2025. The combination should allow organisations to run AI applications alongside traditional workloads without requiring separate infrastructure investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-performance-and-efficiency-gains"&gt;Performance and efficiency gains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical specifications show improvement over previous generations, with up to 55% better core performance compared to Power9 systems and up to 45% more capacity than Power10 systems, according to the company’s own metrics, with the ensuing energy efficiency representing another benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The servers deliver twice the performance per watt compared to comparable x86 servers and up to 28% better server efficiency when using the new Energy Efficient Mode versus Maximum Performance Mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-and-cyber-resilience"&gt;Security and cyber resilience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integrated IBM Power Cyber Vault solution addresses growing cybersecurity concerns within a minute of ransomware detection. The system automatically captures, stores, and tests immutable snapshots of data on a custom-defined schedule, helping protect against data corruption and encryption attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The servers also incorporate NIST-approved quantum-safe cryptography, preparing organisations for future threats by protecting against “harvest-now, decrypt-later” attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisations in the banking, healthcare, retail, and government sectors have traditionally relied on IBM Power systems for mission-critical workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-market-context-and-critical-assessment"&gt;Market context and critical assessment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power11 is available in high-end, mid-range, and entry-level servers, and IBM Power Virtual Server in IBM Cloud provides deployment flexibility, the company says. Integration with Red Hat OpenShift AI and the open-source ecosystem will be important to adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pricing and total cost of ownership details remain undisclosed, which remain factors in enterprise decision-making. Plus, the actual performance of the promised AI capabilities and zero-downtime features will need validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-availability-and-future-outlook"&gt;Availability and future outlook&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM Power11 will be generally available July 25, 2025, with the IBM Spyre Accelerator following in Q4 2025. The company also plans to make watsonx.data, its hybrid data lakehouse solution, available on Power11 by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enterprise server market remains competitive, with organisations increasingly focused on systems that can handle both traditional workloads and AI applications.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RealSense sells cameras that use stereoscopic imaging, a process that combines two images of the same object from different angles to create depth, enhanced with infrared light. This technology helps machines like robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles have a better perception of the physical world around them. The tech is also used for facial authentication.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The common denominator of all of them is they live in the real, physical world,” CEO Nadav Orbach told TechCrunch. “They need to understand the surroundings in 3D and based on that, take and plan actions right in the world. And for that, they need a real-time, high-accuracy ability to understand the surrounding in 3D. And that’s what we do best.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Orbach joined Intel back in 2006 as a CPU architect in Israel. He started working on vision technology in 2011 before becoming the general manager of incubation and disruptive innovation in 2022 and moving to San Francisco last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We knew and understood that 3D perception was going to be big,” Orbach said about the early days of RealSense. “To be honest, we weren’t quite sure in which domain. We tried that across different market segments and different applications, all the way from gesture recognition with computers, phones, until we really found our sweet spot over the years, mostly in robotics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company works with numerous industries outside of robotics, too. Orbach said they’ve heard from fish farms looking to track the volume inside their pens. Chipotle has also used RealSense cameras, in a partnership with AI restaurant software company PreciTaste, to track when food containers are low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RealSense has more than 3,000 customers and has seen a surge in new interest over the last three to four years as AI has improved. With that, the applications for robotics, especially, have scaled.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company realized it may have a better chance keeping up with demand —&amp;nbsp;and scaling itself — if it spun out of Intel and raised its own capital, Orbach said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The spinout plans hatched last year and got the approval from former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger. The company is now independent and raised a $50 million Series A funding round from Intel Capital and other strategic investors to get started on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“For me, it was exciting, to be honest,” Orbach said. “I’m a veteran executive in the company, but it’s first time that I’m, you know, I was on the other side of the table. It was a very humbling experience for me as a first-time CEO to go and and raise money.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RealSense will put the capital toward building out its go-to-market team and making improvements to its technology. The company is particularly focused on improving the tech so it can help improve safety during humans and robot interactions and to improve access control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There is a learning curve of, you know, stepping out,” Orbach said. “I’m extremely excited about that. I’m fortunate to have a very strong team with a lot of people in my team that have entrepreneurial experience. I feel that with my background, together with some strong teammates, I think we have the right mix for success. And for me, it’s a dream coming true.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Family-no-droplets.png?w=898" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;After 14 years of developing inside of semiconductor giant Intel, RealSense is striking out on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Tang Dynasty trade routes to Renaissance palaces, from museum vitrines to high-stakes auction floors, they’ve carried culture across borders, evolving into status symbols, commodities and pieces of contested history. Their value has been shaped by aesthetics and economics, empire and, now, technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83043"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-83043 size-medium" height="756" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/processed-A9E7F820-3217-4729-A3CB-05EBDF4CD46D-960x756.jpeg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83043"&gt;This figure visualizes 20 representative Chinese ceramic craftsmanship styles across seven historical periods, ranging from the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD) to the Modern era (1913–2025). These styles, including kiln-specific categories and decorative techniques, were selected for their historical significance and visual distinctiveness for the AI’s training dataset.

&lt;p&gt;In a lab at University Putra Malaysia, that legacy meets silicon. Researchers there, alongside colleagues at UNSW Sydney, have built an AI system that can classify Chinese ceramics and predict their value with uncanny precision. The tool uses deep learning to analyze decorative motifs, shapes and kiln-specific craftsmanship. It predicts price categories based on real auction data from institutions like Sotheby’s and Christie’s, achieving test accuracy as high as 99%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83046"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-83046 size-medium" height="602" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/processed-FB05C838-3828-4FC9-B5D1-0EF950D7552D-960x602.jpeg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83046"&gt;Beyond form, the AI also analyzes the intricate decorative patterns found on Chinese ceramics, which are organized into six major categories: plant patterns, animal motifs, landscapes, human figures, crackled glaze patterns and geometric designs. The system annotates images at the category level based on the most visually dominant pattern types. Courtesy of Yanfeng Hu, Siqi Wu, Zhuoran Ma, and Si Cheng.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all powered by an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, a consumer-grade GPU beloved by gamers, explains Siqi Wu, one of the researchers behind the project. Not a data center, not specialized industrial hardware, just the same chip pushing frame rates for gamers enjoying &lt;i&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Alan Wake 2&lt;/i&gt; across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation is as old as the trade routes those ceramics once traveled: access, but in this case, access to expertise rather than material goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83040"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-83040 size-medium" height="602" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/processed-91BB8A1F-9A1D-499A-8FFC-7FFE3259BA4B-960x602.jpeg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83040"&gt;The AI system employs a typological classification system for ceramic vessel shapes, based on modular morphological parts like the bottle neck, handle, shoulder, spout, body and base. This approach allows for detailed analysis and classification of shapes such as bottles, jars, plates, bowls, cups, pots and washbasins. Courtesy of Yanfeng Hu, Siqi Wu, Zhuoran Ma and Si Cheng.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Artifact pricing and dating still heavily rely on expert judgment,” Wu said. That expertise remains elusive for younger collectors, smaller institutions and digital archive projects. Wu’s team aims to change that by making cultural appraisal more objective, scalable and accessible to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t stop at classification. The system pairs its YOLOv11-based detection model with an algorithm that learned market value directly from years of real-world auction results. In one test, the AI assessed a Ming Dynasty artifact at roughly 30% below its final hammer price. It’s a reminder that even in an industry steeped in tradition, algorithms can offer new perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those perspectives don’t just quantify heritage, they extend the conversation. The team is already exploring AI for other forms of cultural visual heritage, from Cantonese opera costumes to historical murals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, a graphics card built for gaming is parsing centuries of craftsmanship and entering one of the world’s oldest and most global debates: what makes something valuable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;His current co-founder, Joseph Farsakh, was also at the State Department, working on Yemen Houthi peace negotiations. The two overlapped in national security discussions and started trading notes on how large language models might transform public policy on a day-to-day level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the level the White House operates, critical decisions are often made using a patchwork of tools, spreadsheets, and institutional memory. The founders thought: What if there was a better way to support decision making, one that combined AI-native tools with an understanding of how public policy is decided?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The answer to that question was the idea behind Helios. To make it real, the co-founders brought on Brandon Smith, a long-time acquaintance of Scheidler’s and a machine learning veteran who had worked at Microsoft and Datadog, to lead the technical vision.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our unfair advantage is bringing a super unique blend of domain expertise, contacts, and technical expertise to a really important problem,” Scheidler told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Helios (not to be confused with the payroll/HR management solution, or the climate/economic forecasting product of the same name) emerged from stealth last month with $4 million in seed funding. The round was led by Unusual Ventures, with participation from Founders Inc. and Alumni Ventures, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3026977" height="364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Helios-Team.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Founders of Helios (Right to Left) Joseph Farsakh (president), Joe Scheidler (CEO), Brandon Smith (CTO)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Helios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Helios’ flagship product Proxi, an AI-based operating system built for public policy, regulatory affairs, legal, compliance, and government teams, is still in beta. But, Scheidler says, the company is already seeing early traction with workers in federal, state, and local agencies, as well as Fortune 500 companies and startups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We wanted to empower all public policy, legal, and compliance professionals with end-to-end automation, deploying sort of a web of secure AI agents that are trained and fine-tuned against really robust public policy datasets to support them on anything from strategic advisement to very sensitive and complex writing products, data analysis, and stakeholder mapping,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Proxi has four core features. The first is dubbed “Consult,” and Scheidler describes it as a “conversational AI agent, your 24/7, always-on public policy team member who is constantly scanning the legislative and regulatory environment.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before they begin, customers tell Proxi about themselves, their work, their portfolio, their focus, and objectives. The agents then surface key information to the user every time they log on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a way, Consult is similar to another software platform by Hence, which uses AI to help organizations monitor geopolitical and business risk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Proxi’s second feature is called “Scribe.” This is a collaborative AI editing and writing tool that helps policy professionals turn their soundboarding sessions with Consult into memos, filings, and policy documents. Then there’s “Decipher,” a large-scale data analysis tool that helps users parse long-form bills, reports, and filings, and turn them into structured insights and risk alerts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That’s a lot of what I spent my time doing at the State Department&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;when I would have far preferred to just be on the Hill, building relationships with people who are actually making draft amendments and provisions,” Scheidler said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, Proxi offers a CRM (customer relationship management) tool that helps people visually map out their stakeholder environment and track their interaction history, including meeting notes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s an all-in-one offering, Scheidler said, noting that Helios uses top encryption standards for federal clients, and is currently working through compliance audits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Helios plans to use the seed funding to flesh out its product and engineering team, with a focus on finding the right tech talent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rather than rushing to monetize quickly, Scheidler says the startup is focusing on building long-term business relationships and collecting meticulous feedback from early beta users.&amp;nbsp;“Our goal in five to seven years from now is for Helios to be completely synonymous with all government public and private interaction,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That may mean barrelling past short-term competition like Bloomberg Government and Fiscal Note Forum to challenge longer-term rivals like Palantir, OpenGov, and Civica, the co-founder said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Palantir just surpassed a $300 billion market cap,” Scheidler said. “We think there’s a lot of room to play in this space over time.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;When OpenAI was having its ChatGPT moment in 2022, Joe Scheidler, co-founder and CEO of Helios, was tackling a different kind of challenge: Helping build the White House’s newly authorized cybersecurity office and navigating the complexities of public-private coordination on cyber policies. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We wanted to empower all public policy, legal, and compliance professionals with end-to-end automation, deploying sort of a web of secure AI agents that are trained and fine-tuned against really robust public policy datasets to support them on anything from strategic advisement to very sensitive and complex writing products, data analysis, and stakeholder mapping,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Proxi has four core features. The first is dubbed “Consult,” and Scheidler describes it as a “conversational AI agent, your 24/7, always-on public policy team member who is constantly scanning the legislative and regulatory environment.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before they begin, customers tell Proxi about themselves, their work, their portfolio, their focus, and objectives. The agents then surface key information to the user every time they log on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a way, Consult is similar to another software platform by Hence, which uses AI to help organizations monitor geopolitical and business risk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Proxi’s second feature is called “Scribe.” This is a collaborative AI editing and writing tool that helps policy professionals turn their soundboarding sessions with Consult into memos, filings, and policy documents. Then there’s “Decipher,” a large-scale data analysis tool that helps users parse long-form bills, reports, and filings, and turn them into structured insights and risk alerts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That’s a lot of what I spent my time doing at the State Department&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;when I would have far preferred to just be on the Hill, building relationships with people who are actually making draft amendments and provisions,” Scheidler said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, Proxi offers a CRM (customer relationship management) tool that helps people visually map out their stakeholder environment and track their interaction history, including meeting notes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s an all-in-one offering, Scheidler said, noting that Helios uses top encryption standards for federal clients, and is currently working through compliance audits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Helios plans to use the seed funding to flesh out its product and engineering team, with a focus on finding the right tech talent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rather than rushing to monetize quickly, Scheidler says the startup is focusing on building long-term business relationships and collecting meticulous feedback from early beta users.&amp;nbsp;“Our goal in five to seven years from now is for Helios to be completely synonymous with all government public and private interaction,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That may mean barrelling past short-term competition like Bloomberg Government and Fiscal Note Forum to challenge longer-term rivals like Palantir, OpenGov, and Civica, the co-founder said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Palantir just surpassed a $300 billion market cap,” Scheidler said. “We think there’s a lot of room to play in this space over time.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/helios-wants-to-be-the-ai-operating-system-for-public-policy-professionals/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 14:07:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Humanoids, AVs, and what’s next in AI hardware at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/humanoids-avs-and-whats-next-in-ai-hardware-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2025/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TechCrunch Disrupt 2025&lt;/strong&gt; hits Moscone West in San Francisco from October 27 to 29, bringing together 10,000+ startup and VC leaders for three days of bold ideas, groundbreaking tech, and future-shaping conversations.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jeff Cardenas is the co-founder and CEO of Apptronik, a human-centered robotics company developing some of the world’s most advanced humanoid robots. Focused on designing machines that safely and intelligently work alongside people, Cardenas has guided Apptronik through key partnerships with companies like Google DeepMind, Nvidia, and Mercedes-Benz. His mission is clear: make robotics practical, capable, and commercially viable.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Raquel Urtasun, founder and CEO of Waabi, is one of the most respected voices in self-driving technology. As a decorated researcher and entrepreneur, she is building a new generation of autonomous vehicle systems grounded in simulation and AI. Her work has earned recognition from TIME, Business Insider, and the Royal Society of Canada, and her company is setting new benchmarks in scalable, intelligent AV platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI hardware is no longer just a technical foundation — it is the interface between intelligence and action. Whether it’s robots that can operate in human environments or autonomous systems navigating real-world complexity, the next phase of AI will depend on hardware that can think, sense, and perform.

However, while nearly eight out of ten companies are dipping their toes in the AI water, a similar number admit it hasn’t actually made them any more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such figures reveal a simple truth: just buying the fancy new tech isn’t enough. The real winners will be the ones who figure out how to weave it into the very fabric of who they are and everything they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the most dramatic changes right at the heart of the business: handling claims. That mountain of paperwork and endless phone calls, a process that could drag on for weeks, is finally being bulldozed by AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deployment by New York-based insurer Lemonade back in 2021 resulted in settling over a third of its claims in just three seconds, with no human input. Or look at a major US travel insurer that handles 400,000 claims a year; it went from a completely manual system to one that was 57% automated, cutting down processing times from weeks to just minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this isn’t just about moving faster; it’s about getting it right. AI can slash the kind of costly human errors that lead to claims leakage in the insurance industry by as much as 30%. The knock-on effect is a huge productivity leap, with adjusters able to handle 40-50% more cases. This frees up the real experts to stop being paper-pushers and start focusing on the tricky cases where a human touch and genuine empathy make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a similar story for the underwriters, the people who calculate the risks. AI is giving them superpowers, letting them analyse colossal amounts of data from all sorts of places – like telematics or credit scores – that a person could never sift through alone. It can even draft an initial risk report with incredible accuracy by looking at past data and policies in the blink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this helps create pricing that is fairer and more accurately reflects a person’s unique situation. Zurich, for example, used a modern platform to build a risk management tool that made their assessments 90% more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, underwriting isn’t about looking in the rearview mirror anymore—it’s a living, breathing process that can adapt on the fly to new, complex threats like cyberattacks or the effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t just about back-office wizardry. When deployed in the insurance industry, AI is completely changing the conversation between insurers and the people they serve. It’s allowing a move away from simply reacting to problems to proactively helping customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI chatbots can offer 24/7 support, getting smarter with every question they answer. This lets the human team focus on the more difficult conversations. The real game-changer, though, is making things personal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding a customer’s policy and behaviour, AI can gently nudge them with a renewal reminder or suggest a product that actually fits their life, like usage-based car insurance. It’s about showing customers you actually get them, which builds the kind of loyalty that’s been so hard to come by in an industry where over 30% of claimants feel dissatisfied, and 60% blame slow settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protective instinct also helps the whole system. AI is a brilliant fraud detective for the insurance industry and beyond, spotting weird patterns in data that a person would miss, and has the potential to cut fraud-related losses by up to 40%. It keeps everyone honest and protects the business and its customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s pouring fuel on this fire of change? A new breed of low-code platforms. They are the accelerators, letting insurers build and launch new apps and services much faster than before. In a world where customer tastes and rules can change overnight, that kind of speed is everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part of such tools is they democratise access and put the power to innovate into more hands. They allow regular business users – or ‘citizen developers’ – to build the tools they need without having to be coding geniuses. These platforms often come with strong security and controls, meaning this newfound speed doesn’t have to mean sacrificing safety or compliance, which is non-negotiable for an industry like insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you step back and look at the big picture, it’s clear that getting on board with AI isn’t just a tech project; it’s a make-or-break business strategy. Those who jumped in early are already pulling away from the pack, seeing things like a 14% jump in customer retention and a 48% rise in Net Promoter Scores.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for this technology is set to explode to over $14 billion dollars by 2034, and some believe AI could add $1.1 trillion in value to the industry every year. But the biggest roadblocks aren’t about the technology itself; they’re about people and old habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data, especially in an industry like insurance, is often stuck in old systems which stops AI from seeing the whole picture. To get past this, you need more than clever software. You need leaders with a clear vision, a willingness to change the company culture, and a commitment to training their people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winners in this new era won’t be the ones tinkering with AI in a corner—they’ll be the ones who lead from the top, with a clear plan to make it a part of their DNA.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee,” Argenti told the outlet, adding that it plans to roll out hundreds of instances of Devin, potentially growing to thousands. The bank currently employs around 12,000 human developers, it says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the financial industry’s reputation for being slow and stodgy, Goldman Sachs tends to be cutting edge, and it’s been internally using developer copilots since at least 2024, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Devin is an interesting choice. When Cognition released it last year, it blew up on social media. Some researchers then found that it struggled with more complex coding work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As of May, Devin is now on version 2.1, and Cognition says, performs best on large codebases that provide it with ample context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Devin won’t replace humans at the bank. Argenti advocates for a “hybrid” workforce, so instances of it will be supervised by a human and, he hopes, improve their productivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1301983525.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cognition’s AI coding agent Devin has scored a major customer: Goldman Sachs, the bank’s CIO, Marco Argenti, told CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee,” Argenti told the outlet, adding that it plans to roll out hundreds of instances of Devin, potentially growing to thousands. The bank currently employs around 12,000 human developers, it says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the financial industry’s reputation for being slow and stodgy, Goldman Sachs tends to be cutting edge, and it’s been internally using developer copilots since at least 2024, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Devin is an interesting choice. When Cognition released it last year, it blew up on social media. Some researchers then found that it struggled with more complex coding work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As of May, Devin is now on version 2.1, and Cognition says, performs best on large codebases that provide it with ample context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The AI robots are open source, Raspberry Pi-powered, and come with cartoonish antennae and big googly eyes. They don’t do much out of the box. And that’s kind of the point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, hosts Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha dig into the launch of Reachy Mini, which pulled in a surprising $500,000 in sales in its first 24 hours. As open source companies like Hugging Face explore physical products, Kirsten and Max agree that Reachy Mini might be the &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; of AI hardware: the bots might do nothing in particular, but they’re still captivating.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
