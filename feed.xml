Every few weeks, workers walked acres of towering compost and wood chip piles with nothing more than measuring sticks. They wrapped rulers around each mound, estimated height, and did what company President Nate Baxter now describes as “sixth-grade geometry to figure out volume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, drones glide over those same plants with mechanical precision. Vision systems calculate volumes in real time. The move from measuring sticks to artificial intelligence signals more than efficiency. It is the visible proof of one of corporate America’s most unlikely technology stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The AI revolution finds an unexpected leader&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise AI has been led by predictable players. Software companies with cloud-native architectures. Financial services firms with vast data lakes. Retailers with rich digital touchpoints. Consumer packaged goods companies that handle physical products like fertilizer and soil were not expected to lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet ScottsMiracle-Gro has realized more than half of a targeted $150 million in supply chain savings. It reports a 90 percent improvement in customer service response times. Its predictive models enable weekly reallocation of marketing resources across regional markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Silicon Valley veteran bets on soil science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baxter’s path to ScottsMiracle-Gro (SMG) reads like a calculated pivot, not a corporate rescue. After two decades in semiconductor manufacturing at Intel and Tokyo Electron, he knew how to apply advanced technology to complex operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I sort of initially said, ‘Why would I do this? I’m running a tech company. It’s an industry I’ve been in for 25 years,’” Baxter recalls of his reaction when ScottsMiracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn approached him in 2023. The company was reeling from a collapsed $1.2 billion hydroponics investment and facing what he describes as “pressure from a leverage standpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife challenged him with a direct prompt. If you are not learning or putting yourself in uncomfortable situations, you should change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baxter saw clear parallels between semiconductor manufacturing and SMG’s operations. Both require precision, quality control, and the optimization of complex systems. He also saw untapped potential in SMG’s domain knowledge. One hundred fifty years of horticultural expertise, regulatory know-how, and customer insight had never been fully digitized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It became apparent to me whether it was on the backend with data analytics, business process transformation, and obviously now with AI being front and center of the consumer experience, a lot of opportunities are there,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The declaration that changed everything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pivot began at an all-hands meeting. “I just said, you know, guys, we’re a tech company. You just don’t know it yet,” Baxter recalls. “There’s so much opportunity here to drive this company to where it needs to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first challenge was organizational. SMG had evolved into functional silos. IT, supply chain, and brand teams ran independent systems with little coordination. Drawing on his experience with complex technology organizations, Baxter restructured the consumer business into three business units. General managers became accountable not just for financial results but also for technology implementation within their domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I came in and said, we’re going to create new business units,” he explains. “The buck stops with you and I’m holding you accountable not only for the business results, for the quality of the creative and marketing, but for the implementation of technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the new structure, SMG set up centers of excellence for digital capabilities, insights and analytics, and creative functions. The hybrid design placed centralized expertise behind distributed accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mining corporate memory for AI gold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning legacy knowledge into machine-ready intelligence required what Fausto Fleites, VP of Data Intelligence, calls “archaeological work.” The team excavated decades of business logic embedded in legacy SAP systems and converted filing cabinets of research into AI-ready datasets. Fleites, a Cuban immigrant with a doctorate from FIU who led Florida’s public hurricane loss model before roles at Sears and Cemex, understood the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The costly part of the migration was the business reporting layer we have in SAP Business Warehouse,” Fleites explains. “You need to uncover business logic created in many cases over decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMG chose Databricks as its unified data platform. The team had Apache Spark expertise. Databricks offered strong SAP integration and aligned with a preference for open-source technologies that minimize vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough came through systematic knowledge management. SMG built an AI bot using Google’s Gemini large language model to catalog and clean internal repositories. The system identified duplicates, grouped content by topic, and restructured information for AI consumption. The effort reduced knowledge articles by 30 percent while increasing their utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used Gemini LLMs to actually categorize them into topics, find similar documents,” Fleites explains. A hybrid approach that combined modern AI with techniques like cosine similarity became the foundation for later applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building AI systems that actually understand fertilizer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early trials with off-the-shelf AI exposed a real risk. General-purpose models confused products designed for killing weeds with those for preventing them. That mistake can ruin a lawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different products, if you use one in the wrong place, would actually have a very negative outcome,” Fleites notes. “But those are kind of synonyms in certain contexts to the LLM. So they were recommending the wrong products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution was a new architecture. SMG created what Fleites calls a “hierarchy of agents.” A supervisor agent routes queries to specialized worker agents organized by brand. Each agent draws on deep product knowledge encoded from a 400-page internal training manual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system also changes the conversation. When users ask for recommendations, the agents start with questions about location, goals, and lawn conditions. They narrow possibilities step by step before offering suggestions. The stack integrates with APIs for product availability and state-specific regulatory compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From drones to demand forecasting across the enterprise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation runs across the company. Drones measure inventory piles. Demand forecasting models analyze more than 60 factors, including weather patterns, consumer sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These predictions enable faster moves. When drought struck Texas, the models supported a shift in promotional spending to regions with favorable weather. The reallocation helped drive positive quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We not only have the ability to move marketing and promotion dollars around, but we’ve even gotten to the point where if it’s going to be a big weekend in the Northeast, we’ll shift our field sales resources from other regions up there,” Baxter explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer Services changed as well. AI agents now process incoming emails through Salesforce, draft responses based on the knowledge base, and flag them for brief human review. Draft times dropped from ten minutes to seconds and response quality improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company emphasizes explainable AI. Using SHAP, SMG built dashboards that decompose each forecast and show how weather, promotions, or media spending contribute to predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, if you open a prediction to a business person and you don’t say why, they’ll say, ‘I don’t believe you,’” Fleites explains. Transparency made it possible to move resource allocation from quarterly to weekly cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competing like a startup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMG’s results challenge assumptions about AI readiness in traditional industries. The advantage does not come from owning the most sophisticated models. It comes from combining general-purpose AI with unique, structured domain knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“LLMs are going to be a commodity,” Fleites observes. “The strategic differentiator is what is the additional level of [internal] knowledge we can fit to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnerships are central. SMG works with Google Vertex AI for foundational models, Sierra.ai for production-ready conversational agents, and Kindwise for computer vision. The ecosystem approach lets a small internal team recruited from Meta, Google, and AI startups deliver outsized impact without building everything from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talent follows impact. Conventional wisdom says traditional companies cannot compete with Meta salaries or Google stock. SMG offered something different. It offered the chance to build transformative AI applications with immediate business impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we have these interviews, what we propose to them is basically the ability to have real value with the latest knowledge in these spaces,” Fleites explains. “A lot of people feel motivated to come to us” because much of big tech AI work, despite the hype, “doesn’t really have an impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team design mirrors that philosophy. “My direct reports are leaders and not only manage people, but are technically savvy,” Fleites notes. “We always are constantly switching hands between developing or maintaining a solution versus strategy versus managing people.” He still writes code weekly. The small team of 15 to 20 AI and engineering professionals stays lean by contracting out implementation while keeping “the know-how and the direction and the architecture” in-house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;When innovation meets immovable objects&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every pilot succeeded. SMG tested semi-autonomous forklifts in a 1.3 million square foot distribution facility. Remote drivers in the Philippines controlled up to five vehicles at once with strong safety records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The technology was actually really great,” Baxter acknowledges. The vehicles could not lift enough weight for SMG’s heavy products. The company paused implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not everything we’ve tried has gone smoothly,” Baxter admits. “But I think another important point is you have to focus on a few critical ones and you have to know when something isn’t going to work and readjust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson tracks with semiconductor discipline. Investments must show measurable returns within set timeframes. Regulatory complexity adds difficulty. Products must comply with EPA rules and a patchwork of state restrictions, which AI systems must navigate correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The gardening sommelier and agent-to-agent futures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roadmap reflects a long-term view. SMG plans a “gardening sommelier” mobile app in 2026 that identifies plants, weeds, and lawn problems from photos and provides instant guidance. A beta already helps field sales teams answer complex product questions by querying the 400-page knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is exploring agent-to-agent communication so its specialized AI can interface with retail partners’ systems. A customer who asks a Walmart chatbot for lawn advice could trigger an SMG query that returns accurate, regulation-compliant recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMG has launched AI-powered search on its website, replacing keyword systems with conversational engines based on the internal stack. The future vision pairs predictive models with conversational agents so the system can reach out when conditions suggest a customer may need help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What traditional industries can learn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ScottsMiracle-Gro&amp;#x27;s transformation offers a clear playbook for enterprises. The advantage doesn&amp;#x27;t come from deploying the most sophisticated models. Instead, it comes from combining AI with proprietary domain knowledge that competitors can&amp;#x27;t easily replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By making general managers responsible for both business results and technology implementation, SMG ensured AI wasn&amp;#x27;t just an IT initiative but a business imperative. The 150 years of horticultural expertise only became valuable when it was digitized, structured, and made accessible to AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legacy companies competing for AI engineers can&amp;#x27;t match Silicon Valley compensation packages. But they can offer something tech giants often can&amp;#x27;t: immediate, measurable impact. When engineers see their weather forecasting models directly influence quarterly results or their agent architecture prevent customers from ruining their lawns, the work carries weight that another incremental improvement to an ad algorithm never will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a right to win,” Baxter says. “We have 150 years of this experience.” That experience is now data, and data is the company’s competitive edge. ScottsMiracle-Gro didn’t outspend its rivals or chase the newest AI model. It turned knowledge into an operating system for growth. For a company built on soil, its biggest breakthrough might be cultivating data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Some immediately declared the app platform of the future — predicting a ChatGPT-powered world where Apple’s App Store becomes obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;An open question was answered today – "what will the AI-native distribution channel be?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like ChatGPT will be that channel with 800M active users + the Apps SDK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is likely as important as Steve Jobs announcing the app store in March of 2008 … pic.twitter.com/6RCbIi0foq&lt;/p&gt;— Anish Acharya (@illscience) October 7, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But while OpenAI’s app platform presents an emerging threat, Apple’s vision for an improved Siri — though still seriously delayed — could still play out in its favor. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After all, Apple already controls the hardware, the operating system, and has roughly 1.5 billion iPhone users globally, compared to ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly active users. If Apple’s bet pays off, it could position the iPhone maker in a way that would not only maintain its app industry dominance but also modernize how we use apps in the AI era. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple’s plan is to kill the app icon without killing the app itself. Its vision for AI-powered computing — introduced at its developer conference last year — would see iPhone users interact with an overhauled version of Siri and a revamped system that changes the way you use apps on your phone. (Imagine less tapping and more talking.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apps-are-passe-long-live-apps"&gt;Apps are passé, long live apps?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s an idea whose time has come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Organizing little tappable icons on your iPhone’s Home Screen to make online information more accessible is a dated metaphor for computing. Meant to resemble a scaled-down version of a computer’s desktop, apps are becoming a less common way for users to interact with many of their preferred online services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These days, consumers are just as likely to ask an AI assistant for a recommendation or insight as they are to do a Google search or launch a dedicated, single-purpose app, like Yelp. They’ll talk out loud to their smart speakers or Bluetooth-connected AirPods to play their favorite tunes; they’ll ask a chatbot for business information or a summary of reviews for a new movie or show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI, a large language model trained on web-scraped data and more, determines what the user wants to know and spits out a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is arguably easier than scouring through Google’s search results for the right link with the answer. (That’s something Google itself realized over a decade ago, when it started putting answers to user queries right on the search results page.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI is also often easier than finding the right app on your now overcrowded iPhone, launching it, and then interacting with its user interface — which varies from app to app — to perform your task or get an answer to your question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056248" height="454" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/iphone-app-library-GettyImages1756853433.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;NurPhoto / Contributor &lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;(opens in a new window)&lt;/span&gt; / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, ChatGPT’s app system, while seemingly improving on this model, remains locked inside the ChatGPT user experience. It requires consumers to engage in a chatbot-style interface to use their apps, which could require user education. To call up an app, you have to name it as the first word of your prompt or otherwise mention the app by name to get a button that prompts you to “use the app for the answer.” Then, you have to type in an accurate query. (If you mess this up, early tests by Bloomberg indicate you could get stuck on a loading screen with no results!)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We have to wonder: is this the future of apps, or just the future while there’s no other competition? When another solution becomes available — one that’s built into your iPhone, no less — will consumers keep using ChatGPT, or are they still willing to give Siri another try? We don’t know, but we wouldn’t count out Apple yet, even though Siri has quite a bad reputation to salvage at this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Siri may be an embarrassment as it stands today, but Apple’s overall ecosystem has advantages. For starters, consumers &lt;em&gt;already have&lt;/em&gt; the apps they want to use on their phone or know how to find them on the App Store, if not. They’ve used many of these apps for years. Muscle memory goes a long way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, there are a few roadblocks to getting started with ChatGPT’s app platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056483" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2641.png?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You have to install the app in question, of course; then you have to connect the app to ChatGPT by jumping through a warning-filled permission screen. This process requires you to authenticate with the app using your existing username and password, and to enter the two-factor authentication code, if applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After this one-time setup, things should be easier. For instance, after you generate a Spotify playlist with AI, it can be launched in the Spotify app with a tap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, this experience won’t differ much from Apple’s plans if Apple is able to make things work as promised. Apple says you’ll be able to talk or text Siri to control your apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056249" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-09-at-5.24.02PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are other disadvantages to the OpenAI app model. You can only interact with one app at a time, instead of being able to switch back and forth between apps — something that could be useful when comparing prices or trying to decide between a hotel room and an Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using apps within ChatGPT also strips away the branding, design, and identity that consumers associate with their favorite apps. (For those who hate how cluttered Spotify’s app has become, perhaps that’s a good thing. Others, however, will disagree.) And, in some cases, using the mobile app version to accomplish your goals may still be easier than using the ChatGPT app version because of the flexibility the former offers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, compelling users to switch app platforms could be difficult when there isn’t an obvious advantage to using apps within ChatGPT — except for the fact that it’s neat that you can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-apple-save-siri-s-reputation-with-ai-features"&gt;Can Apple save Siri’s reputation with AI features? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its WWDC 2024 demonstration — which Apple swears was not “demoware” — the company showed how the apps would function under this new system and how they could use other AI features like proofreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most importantly, Apple told developers that they’ll be able to take advantage of some of its AI capabilities without having to do additional work — like a note-taking app using proofreading or rewriting tools. Plus, developers who have already integrated SiriKit into their apps will be able to do more in terms of having users take action in their apps. (SiriKit, a toolkit for making apps interoperable with Siri and Apple’s Shortcuts, is something developers have been using since iOS 10.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These developers will see immediate enhancements when the new Siri rolls out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2792502" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-SiriKit-01-e1718052065212.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple said it will focus on categories like Notes, Media, Messaging, Payments, Restaurant Reservations, VoIP Calling, and Workouts, to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apps in these categories will be able to let their users take actions via Siri. In practice, that means Siri will be able to invoke any item from an app’s menus. For example, you could ask Siri to see your presenter notes in a slide deck, and your productivity app would respond accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The apps would also be able to access any text displayed on the page using Apple’s standard text systems. That could make the app interactions feel more natural, without the user having to give specifically worded prompts or commands. For instance, if you had a reminder to wish your grandpa a happy birthday, you could say “FaceTime him” to take that action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2792501" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-SiriKit-02.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple’s existing Intents framework is also being updated to gain access to Apple Intelligence, covering even more apps in categories like Books, Browsers, Cameras, Document Readers, File Management, Journals, Mail, Photos, Presentations, Spreadsheets, Whiteboards, and Word Processors. Here, Apple is creating new “Intents” that are pre-defined, trained, and tested, and making them available to developers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That means you could tell the photo-editing app Darkroom to apply a cinematic filter to an image via Siri. Plus, Siri will be able to suggest an app’s actions, helping iPhone users discover what their apps can do and take those actions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Developers have been adopting the App Intents framework, introduced in iOS 16, because it offers other functionality to integrate their app’s actions and content with other platform features, including Spotlight, Siri, the iPhone’s Action button, widgets, controls, and visual search features — not just Apple Intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2851355" height="385" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/photo-edits-via-AI-siri.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also, unlike ChatGPT, Apple runs its own operating system on its own hardware and offers the App Store as a discovery mechanism, the app infrastructure, and developer tools, APIs, and frameworks — not just the AI-powered interface that will help you use your apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though Apple may have to borrow some AI tech from others to do that last bit, it has the data to personalize your app recommendations, and, for the privacy-minded, the controls that let you limit how much information apps themselves can collect. (Where’s the “Do Not Track” option for ChatGPT’s app system, we wonder?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s system doesn’t work out of the box with all your apps at launch. It requires developer adoption and relies on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a newer technology for connecting AI assistants to other systems. That’s why ChatGPT currently works with only a handful of apps, like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva. MCP adoption is growing, but the delay in its becoming broadly adopted could give Apple the extra time it needs to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What’s more, word is that Apple’s AI system is nearly ready. The company is reportedly already internally testing this, allowing users to take actions in apps by using Siri voice commands. Bloomberg reported that this smarter version of Siri works out of the box works with many apps, including those from major players like Uber, AllTrails, Threads, Temu, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook, and WhatsApp. And it’s still on track to ship next year, Apple confirmed to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apple-has-an-iphone-openai-has-jony-ive"&gt;Apple has an iPhone, OpenAI has Jony Ive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The iPhone’s status as an app platform will also be difficult to disrupt, even from a company as large and powerful as OpenAI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT maker understands this, too, which is why OpenAI is exploring its own device with Apple’s former head of design, Jony Ive. It wants its AI to become more of a part of consumers’ everyday lives and habits, which could require a hardware device. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But, so far, the company has struggled to think up a better computing paradigm than the smartphone, reports indicate. At the same time, the general public has demonstrated an aversion to always-on AI devices, which bump up against existing social norms and threaten privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI backlash has covered AI device maker Friend’s NYC subway posters, led Taylor Swift fans to attack their idol for dabbling in AI, and threatened the reputation of popular consumer brands and enterprise businesses alike. That leaves the future success of an OpenAI device in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For now, that means OpenAI’s app model is one that essentially boils down to using its app to control other apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Apple gets its Siri upgrade right, that intermediary may not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;This week, OpenAI announced that apps can now run directly inside ChatGPT, letting users book travel, create playlists, and edit designs without switching between different apps. Some immediately declared the app platform of the future — predicting a ChatGPT-powered world where Apple’s App Store becomes obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;An open question was answered today – "what will the AI-native distribution channel be?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like ChatGPT will be that channel with 800M active users + the Apps SDK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is likely as important as Steve Jobs announcing the app store in March of 2008 … pic.twitter.com/6RCbIi0foq&lt;/p&gt;— Anish Acharya (@illscience) October 7, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But while OpenAI’s app platform presents an emerging threat, Apple’s vision for an improved Siri — though still seriously delayed — could still play out in its favor. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After all, Apple already controls the hardware, the operating system, and has roughly 1.5 billion iPhone users globally, compared to ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly active users. If Apple’s bet pays off, it could position the iPhone maker in a way that would not only maintain its app industry dominance but also modernize how we use apps in the AI era. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple’s plan is to kill the app icon without killing the app itself. Its vision for AI-powered computing — introduced at its developer conference last year — would see iPhone users interact with an overhauled version of Siri and a revamped system that changes the way you use apps on your phone. (Imagine less tapping and more talking.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apps-are-passe-long-live-apps"&gt;Apps are passé, long live apps?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s an idea whose time has come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Organizing little tappable icons on your iPhone’s Home Screen to make online information more accessible is a dated metaphor for computing. Meant to resemble a scaled-down version of a computer’s desktop, apps are becoming a less common way for users to interact with many of their preferred online services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These days, consumers are just as likely to ask an AI assistant for a recommendation or insight as they are to do a Google search or launch a dedicated, single-purpose app, like Yelp. They’ll talk out loud to their smart speakers or Bluetooth-connected AirPods to play their favorite tunes; they’ll ask a chatbot for business information or a summary of reviews for a new movie or show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI is also often easier than finding the right app on your now overcrowded iPhone, launching it, and then interacting with its user interface — which varies from app to app — to perform your task or get an answer to your question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056248" height="454" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/iphone-app-library-GettyImages1756853433.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;NurPhoto / Contributor &lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;(opens in a new window)&lt;/span&gt; / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apple-has-an-iphone-openai-has-jony-ive"&gt;Apple has an iPhone, OpenAI has Jony Ive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The iPhone’s status as an app platform will also be difficult to disrupt, even from a company as large and powerful as OpenAI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT maker understands this, too, which is why OpenAI is exploring its own device with Apple’s former head of design, Jony Ive. It wants its AI to become more of a part of consumers’ everyday lives and habits, which could require a hardware device. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But, so far, the company has struggled to think up a better computing paradigm than the smartphone, reports indicate. At the same time, the general public has demonstrated an aversion to always-on AI devices, which bump up against existing social norms and threaten privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI backlash has covered AI device maker Friend’s NYC subway posters, led Taylor Swift fans to attack their idol for dabbling in AI, and threatened the reputation of popular consumer brands and enterprise businesses alike. That leaves the future success of an OpenAI device in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For now, that means OpenAI’s app model is one that essentially boils down to using its app to control other apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Apple gets its Siri upgrade right, that intermediary may not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/11/its-not-too-late-for-apple-to-get-ai-right/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Ready or not, enterprises are betting on AI (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/11/ready-or-not-enterprises-are-betting-on-ai/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ai-avatar-simpleshow-2154151760.jpg?resize=1200,826" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-megaphone wp-block-embed-megaphone"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;This has been a big week for AI companies signing enterprise deals, with Zendesk unveiling new AI agents that are supposed to be able to resolve 80% of customer service issues, Anthropic and IBM announcing a strategic partnership, and Deloitte also announcing a deal with Anthropic. Plus, Google announced a new AI-for-business platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That doesn’t mean it’s going to be smooth sailing for big organizations using AI. In fact, the timing of the Deloitte announcement was a bit awkward, coming on the same day the Australia Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said the professional services and consulting firm would have to pay a refund for delivering a report to the department with what appeared to be a number of AI-generated hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec, Sean O’Kane, and I discussed the latest AI headlines, contrasting it with last week’s news about the new Sora app. While AI companies may eventually make real money from consumer social networking apps, enterprise deals offer a more immediate path to significant revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthony: &lt;/strong&gt;I think this actually ties back to our discussion last week about some of these GenAI social networks. We were framing that as potentially a way that these AI companies could eventually make money, which I definitely think is the case, but there’s a long road to get there. And the enterprise, sometimes people don’t find it quite as interesting or sexy as consumer, [but] it’s actually where the real money is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maybe Sora is how OpenAI will make money five years from now, but this is how these companies are going to make money now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And the Deloitte [news] was especially striking. Sometimes you can feel like a little bit of a broken record to just point out how these models [aren’t always] totally ready for prime time, but I find it encouraging that the Australian government actually pushed back and said, no, you cannot do this.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not necessarily that no one should ever use AI in the creation of these kinds of reports, although I think you could make that argument. But if you’re going to do it, you actually have to be responsible for the outputs. You have to actually go through and make sure that the information being cited is real. You can’t feed it into a model and just [say] “All right, my job is done, that’ll be however many billable hours.” I think anyone who does that should be embarrassed and fined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirsten:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely. Sean, Zendesk also had an announcement this week, and they’re really creating these tools that are going to handle pretty much all of customer service, basically removing the human from that process. In your everyday [life], how you go about the world or how automakers deal with service, for instance, are you starting to see that kind of [automation] creep in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I’ve actually written about it a few times. There are a bunch of different startups that are developing full customer service suites, voice agents, LLMs for emails and texts [from] dealerships and service centers. I actually think that’s a worthy idea, because the problem there isn’t: We don’t have enough people for the jobs to do this stuff and it’s going to take their jobs away. It’s that you can never get somebody on the phone or you get bounced around.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Especially going for service, you get bounced to the service department. Everybody’s busy. So if you can capture it accurately and make it easier for people to get a response, the question there for me is how much will those businesses adopt it and stick with it. There’s been all sorts of technologies over the years, like web forms and things like that, where these dealerships have done it, but then they forget about it. And then it just sits on their website and you think that it’s going to work, and then it doesn’t work, because they just want you to call them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So I have some optimism and some hope that stuff like this is actually gonna be people’s first touch point with [a business]. And it looks like we’re about to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
