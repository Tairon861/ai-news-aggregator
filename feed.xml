&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the U.S. capital, Huang met with President Trump and U.S. policymakers, reaffirming &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;NVIDIA’s support for the Administration’s effort to create jobs, strengthen domestic AI infrastructure and onshore manufacturing, and ensure that America leads in AI worldwide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Beijing, Huang&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;met with government and industry officials to discuss how AI will &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;raise productivity and expand opportunity. The discussions underscored how researchers worldwide can advance safe and secure AI for the benefit of all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Huang also provided an update to customers, noting that NVIDIA is filing applications to sell the NVIDIA H20 GPU again. The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon. Finally, Huang announced a new, fully compliant NVIDIA RTX PRO GPU that “is ideal for digital twin AI for smart factories and logistics.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Huang noted during his visits, the world has reached an inflection point — AI has become a fundamental resource, like energy, water and the internet. Jensen emphasized NVIDIA’s commitment to support open-source research, foundation models and applications, which democratize AI and will empower emerging economies in every region, including Latin America, Europe, Asia and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“General-purpose, open-source research and foundation models are the backbone of AI innovation,” Huang explained to reporters in D.C. “We believe that every civil model should run best on the U.S. technology stack, encouraging nations worldwide to choose America.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company expects to receive U.S. government licenses soon and begin deliveries shortly after, according to a blog post. Nvidia is also introducing a new “RTX Pro” chip designed specifically for the Chinese market, calling it “fully compliant” with regulations and ideal for digital manufacturing applications like smart factories and logistics.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The H20 chip sits at the center of a broader U.S.-China tech standoff. While not Nvidia’s most advanced AI processor, the H20 is the most powerful chip the company can legally sell to China under existing export controls. It’s specifically designed for “inference” tasks — running existing AI models for day-to-day applications — rather than training new AI systems from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chinese tech giants including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent had been aggressively stockpiling these chips in the first three months of this year in anticipation of stricter export controls. The chip’s appeal lies partly in its superior memory bandwidth compared to Chinese alternatives, along with Nvidia’s widely-adopted software ecosystem that makes the hardware easier to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The regulatory back-and-forth began in April when the Trump administration restricted H20 sales, potentially costing Nvidia $15 billion to $16 billion in revenue, judging by how much Chinese firms reportedly splashed out for them in the first quarter alone. The move targeted chips exceeding specific performance thresholds, including total memory bandwidth of 1,400 gigabytes per second or input/output bandwidth of 1,100 GB per second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the restrictions were fairly short-lived. Soon after CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1 million-per-head dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in early April, the administration paused the ban. According to NPR, the White House changed its mind after Nvidia promised new U.S. data center investments. Within a week of NPR’s report being published, Nvidia announced plans to build AI servers in the U.S. worth as much as $500 billion over the next four years, with help from partners such as TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The flip-flopping has drawn criticism from U.S. lawmakers who argue it undermines the country’s efforts to limit China’s AI capabilities and who point to DeepSeek to underscore why it matters. The Chinese startup took the AI world by storm earlier this year by building an impressive model using Nvidia’s H800 chips, which are slightly more powerful predecessors to the H20. (The U.S. banned the sale of those H800 chips back in October 2023, but Chinese suppliers have managed to figure out workarounds.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement sent to TechCrunch, Nvidia spokesman Hector Marinez said Huang has been meeting with officials in Washington and Beijing this month and “emphasizing the benefits that AI will bring to business and society worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the meantime, the whole episode underscores the ongoing balancing act that U.S. policymakers are attempting, with concerns about national security running up against powerful commercial interests.

The company has been poaching AI researchers, while Zuckerberg announced on Monday that Meta is building a 5-gigawatt data center called Hyperion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The urgency is palpable. As SemiAnalysis reported last week and Business Insider noted, Meta is so eager to boost its computing power that it’s literally erecting tents for temporary data center capacity while its facilities are still under construction. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These are all signs that Meta wants to build up its AI capacity faster after falling behind competitors like OpenAI, xAI, and Google — and that Zuckerberg isn’t willing to wait for typical construction timelines to close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This design isn’t about beauty or redundancy. It’s about getting compute online fast!” SemiAnalysis said in its report. “From prefabricated power and cooling modules to ultra-light structures, speed is of the essence as there is no backup generation (ie, no diesel generators in sight),” it added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for its Hyperion data center, Meta spokesperson Ashley Gabriel tells TechCrunch that it will be located in Louisiana and will likely have a capacity of 2 gigawatts by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

God help them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On July 8, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic announced a $23 million partnership with one of the largest teachers’ unions in the United States to bring more AI into K–12 classrooms. Called the National Academy for AI Instruction, the initiative will train teachers at a New York City headquarters on how to use AI both for teaching and for tasks like planning lessons and writing reports, starting this fall&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The companies could face an uphill battle. Right now, most of the public perceives AI’s use in the classroom as nothing short of ruinous—a surefire way to dampen critical thinking and hasten the decline of our collective attention span (a viral story from &lt;em&gt;New York &lt;/em&gt;magazine, for example, described how easy it now is to coast through college thanks to constant access to ChatGPT).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amid that onslaught, AI companies insist that AI promises more individualized learning, faster and more creative lesson planning, and quicker grading. The companies sponsoring this initiative are, of course, not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;No—as they hunt for profits, their goal is to make users out of teachers and students. Anthropic is pitching its AI models to universities, and OpenAI offers free courses for teachers. In an initial training session for teachers by the new National Academy for AI Instruction, representatives from Microsoft showed teachers how to use the company’s AI tools for lesson planning and emails, according to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It's early days, but what does the evidence actually say about whether AI is helping or hurting students? There’s at least some data to support the case made by tech companies: A recent survey of 1,500 teens conducted by Harvard’s Graduate School of Education showed that kids are using AI to brainstorm and answer questions they're afraid to ask in the classroom. Studies examining settings ranging from math classes in Nigeria to colleges physics courses at Harvard have suggested that AI tutors can lead students to become more engaged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And yet there’s more to the story. The same Harvard survey revealed that kids are also frequently using AI for cheating and shortcuts. And an oft-cited paper from Microsoft found that relying on AI can reduce critical thinking. Not to mention the fact that “hallucinations” of incorrect information are an inevitable part of how large language models work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There's a lack of clear evidence that AI can be a net benefit for students, and it's hard to trust that the AI companies funding this initiative will give honest advice on when &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;to use AI in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the fanfare around the academy's launch, and the fact the first teacher training is scheduled to take place in just a few months, OpenAI and Anthropic told me they couldn't share any specifics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It's not as if teachers themselves aren't already grappling with how to approach AI. One such teacher, Christopher Harris, who leads a library system covering 22 rural school districts in New York, has created a curriculum aimed at AI literacy. Topics range from privacy when using smart speakers (a lesson for second graders) to misinformation and deepfakes (instruction for high schoolers). I asked him what he’d like to see in the curriculum used by the new National Academy for AI Instruction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The real outcome should be teachers that are confident enough in their understanding of how AI works and how it can be used as a tool that they can teach students about the technology as well,” he says. The thing to avoid would be overfocusing on tools and pre-built prompts that teachers are instructed to use without knowing how they work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But all this will be for naught without an adjustment to how schools evaluate students in the age of AI, Harris says: “The bigger issue will be shifting the fundamental approaches to how we assign and assess student work in the face of AI cheating.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new initiative is led by the American Federation of Teachers, which represents 1.8 million members, as well as the United Federation of Teachers, which represents 200,000 members in New York.

God help them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On July 8, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic announced a $23 million partnership with one of the largest teachers’ unions in the United States to bring more AI into K–12 classrooms. Called the National Academy for AI Instruction, the initiative will train teachers at a New York City headquarters on how to use AI both for teaching and for tasks like planning lessons and writing reports, starting this fall&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The companies could face an uphill battle. Right now, most of the public perceives AI’s use in the classroom as nothing short of ruinous—a surefire way to dampen critical thinking and hasten the decline of our collective attention span (a viral story from &lt;em&gt;New York &lt;/em&gt;magazine, for example, described how easy it now is to coast through college thanks to constant access to ChatGPT).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amid that onslaught, AI companies insist that AI promises more individualized learning, faster and more creative lesson planning, and quicker grading. The companies sponsoring this initiative are, of course, not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;No—as they hunt for profits, their goal is to make users out of teachers and students. Anthropic is pitching its AI models to universities, and OpenAI offers free courses for teachers. In an initial training session for teachers by the new National Academy for AI Instruction, representatives from Microsoft showed teachers how to use the company’s AI tools for lesson planning and emails, according to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It's early days, but what does the evidence actually say about whether AI is helping or hurting students? There’s at least some data to support the case made by tech companies: A recent survey of 1,500 teens conducted by Harvard’s Graduate School of Education showed that kids are using AI to brainstorm and answer questions they're afraid to ask in the classroom. Studies examining settings ranging from math classes in Nigeria to colleges physics courses at Harvard have suggested that AI tutors can lead students to become more engaged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And yet there’s more to the story. The same Harvard survey revealed that kids are also frequently using AI for cheating and shortcuts. And an oft-cited paper from Microsoft found that relying on AI can reduce critical thinking. Not to mention the fact that “hallucinations” of incorrect information are an inevitable part of how large language models work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There's a lack of clear evidence that AI can be a net benefit for students, and it's hard to trust that the AI companies funding this initiative will give honest advice on when &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;to use AI in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the fanfare around the academy's launch, and the fact the first teacher training is scheduled to take place in just a few months, OpenAI and Anthropic told me they couldn't share any specifics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It's not as if teachers themselves aren't already grappling with how to approach AI. One such teacher, Christopher Harris, who leads a library system covering 22 rural school districts in New York, has created a curriculum aimed at AI literacy. Topics range from privacy when using smart speakers (a lesson for second graders) to misinformation and deepfakes (instruction for high schoolers). I asked him what he’d like to see in the curriculum used by the new National Academy for AI Instruction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The real outcome should be teachers that are confident enough in their understanding of how AI works and how it can be used as a tool that they can teach students about the technology as well,” he says. The thing to avoid would be overfocusing on tools and pre-built prompts that teachers are instructed to use without knowing how they work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But all this will be for naught without an adjustment to how schools evaluate students in the age of AI, Harris says: “The bigger issue will be shifting the fundamental approaches to how we assign and assess student work in the face of AI cheating.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new initiative is led by the American Federation of Teachers, which represents 1.8 million members, as well as the United Federation of Teachers, which represents 200,000 members in New York. If they win over these groups, the tech companies will have significant influence over how millions of teachers learn about AI. But some educators are resisting the use of AI entirely, including several hundred who signed an open letter last week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Helen Choi is one of them. “I think it is incumbent upon educators to scrutinize the tools that they use in the classroom to look past hype,” says Choi, an associate professor at the University of Southern California, where she teaches writing. “Until we know that something is useful, safe, and ethical, we have a duty to resist mass adoption of tools like large language models that are not designed by educators with education in mind.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

Nextdoor has also updated its overall design to look more contemporary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Launched 15 years ago, Nextdoor has long served as a popular platform for neighborhood conversations, helping users connect over things like recommendations for plumbers and suggestions for nearby places to eat. But eventually, its growth stalled and engagement declined as the platform became associated with posts containing misinformation and racism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, the company is looking to turn things around and attract more users by making its platform more helpful, useful, and timely. With this redesign, Nextdoor is looking to increase the quality and quantity of local information on the platform, Nextdoor CEO and co-founder Nirav Tolia told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To bring news to its platform, Nextdoor has partnered with 3,500 local publications across the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. Notable outlets include the San Francisco Standard, The London Standard, and The Toronto Star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027588" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-12.54.43PM.png?w=347" width="347" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Nextdoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The reason that this is so important for us is historically, Nextdoor has relied 100% on user-generated content, just the content that’s created by your neighbors,” Tolia said. “That’s been a great source of information. But, to really make sure if it’s happening in your neighborhood, we need to bring in local news as well. So this is the first time we’re letting third party publishers use our distribution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tolia stated that these aren’t commercial agreements, as Nextdoor isn’t paying for the content, nor are the publishers paying the company. Additionally, Nextdoor isn’t hosting the content; it’s simply displaying a headline, a snippet, and an image, and directing traffic to the publications. Users will be able to discuss the news in a comments section under each post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tolia noted that publishers are just the first new type of content coming to Nextdoor, as the platform plans to allow small businesses, schools, and organizations to have native presences in the app in the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In terms of the new alerts, Nextdoor now shows real-time updates on things like weather, traffic, power outages, storms, and wildfires. These alerts will appear on a dynamic neighborhood map, allowing neighbors to have timely conversations about safety and preparedness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The service is partnering with Samdesk and Weather.com, which includes The Weather Channel app and Weather.com, to power these alerts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027590" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-12.54.48PM.png?w=337" width="337" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Nextdoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When there’s something that is definitely worth paying attention to, we call that the yellow state, and we’ll put that alert right at the top,” Tolia said. “When there’s something critical, we call that the red state and it’ll take over the whole app, because at that point, you don’t care about the conversations neighbors are having about pickleball. You don’t really care about the new restaurant review that the local publishers put in. You need to get together with your neighbors and help save each other’s lives in some cases.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tolia noted that these alerts are hyper-localized because Nextdoor is built on a geospatial platform. So unlike Amber Alerts that are sent out to everyone in a certain location, Nextdoor says it can personalize its alerts down to the house. For example, if there’s a power outage, the app will only send the alert to the people whose power is out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for the launch of Faves, Tolia says recommendations from neighbors are more valuable than going on Google or ChatGPT when looking to find a local restaurant or a place to spend time with family over the weekend, which is why Nextdoor is launching the feature.&amp;nbsp;The new Faves feature displays curated lists of recommendations, and also lets you ask specific questions to get suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have an LLM for every neighborhood where we’ve taken 15 years of neighbor conversations and we can now answer questions about that information in a really compelling way,” Tolia said. “So we have the first, as far as we know, the first truly local AI that’s powered by neighbor conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can ask questions like, “What is the best place to hike with kids?” and receive a quick, summarized response that pulls information from posts from real users on Nextdoor. Underneath the summary, you can see and click through to the posts that the summary is referencing.&lt;/p&gt;

Ko, who researches audio processing, and his collaborators wanted to prevent this kind of identity fraud. “People are starting to demand ways to opt out of the unknown generation of their voices without consent,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt; &lt;p&gt;AI companies generally keep a tight grip on their models to discourage misuse. For example, if you ask ChatGPT to give you someone’s phone number or instructions for doing something illegal, it will likely just tell you it cannot help. However, as many examples over time have shown, clever prompt engineering or model fine-tuning can sometimes get these models to say things they otherwise wouldn’t. The unwanted information may still be hiding somewhere inside the model so that it can be accessed with the right techniques.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At present, companies tend to deal with this issue by applying guardrails; the idea is to check whether the prompts or the AI’s responses contain disallowed material. Machine unlearning instead asks whether an AI can be made to forget a piece of information that the company doesn’t want it to know. The technique takes a leaky model and the specific training data to be redacted and uses them to create a new model—essentially, a version of the original that never learned that piece of data. While machine unlearning has ties to older techniques in AI research, it’s only in the past couple of years that it’s been applied to large language models.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jinju Kim, a master’s student at Sungkyunkwan University who worked on the paper with Ko and others, sees guardrails as fences around the bad data put in place to keep people away from it. “You can’t get through the fence, but some people will still try to go under the fence or over the fence,” says Kim. But unlearning, she says, attempts to remove the bad data altogether, so there is nothing behind the fence at all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The way current text-to-speech systems are designed complicates this a little more, though. These so-called “zero-shot” models use examples of people’s speech to learn to re-create any voice, including those not in the training set—with enough data, it can be a good mimic when supplied with even a small sample of someone’s voice. So “unlearning” means a model not only needs to “forget” voices it was trained on but also has to learn not to mimic specific voices it wasn’t trained on. All the while, it still needs to perform well for other voices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To demonstrate how to get those results, Kim taught a recreation of VoiceBox, a speech generation model from Meta, that when it was prompted to produce a text sample in one of the voices to be redacted, it should instead respond with a random voice. To make these voices realistic, the model “teaches” itself using random voices of its own creation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;According to the team’s results, which are to be presented this week at the International Conference on Machine Learning, prompting the model to imitate a voice it has “unlearned” gives back a result that—according to state-of-the-art tools that measure voice similarity—mimics the forgotten voice more than 75% less effectively than the model did before. In practice, this makes the new voice unmistakably different. But the forgetfulness comes at a cost: The model is about 2.8% worse at mimicking permitted voices. While these percentages are a bit hard to interpret, the demo the researchers released online offers very convincing results, both for how well redacted speakers are forgotten and how well the rest are remembered. A sample from the demo is given below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-audio"&gt;&lt;audio controls="controls" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/original_audio.wav"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A voice sample of a speaker to be forgotten by the model.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-audio"&gt;&lt;audio controls="controls" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/original_audio_generated.wav"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The generated text-to-speech audio from the original model using the above as a prompt.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-audio"&gt;&lt;audio controls="controls" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/new_audio_generated_1.wav"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The generated text-to-speech audio using the same prompt, but now from the model where the speaker was forgotten.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ko says the unlearning process can take “several days,” depending on how many speakers the researchers want the model to forget. Their method also requires an audio clip about five minutes long for each speaker whose voice is to be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In machine unlearning, pieces of data are often replaced with randomness so that they can’t be reverse-engineered back to the original. In this paper, the randomness for the forgotten speakers is very high—a sign, the authors claim, that they are truly forgotten by the model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“I have seen people optimizing for randomness in other contexts,” says Vaidehi Patil, a PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who researches machine unlearning. “This is one of the first works I’ve seen for speech.” Patil is organizing a machine unlearning workshop affiliated with the conference, and the voice unlearning research will also be presented there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She points out that unlearning itself involves inherent trade-offs between efficiency and forgetfulness because the process can take time, and can degrade the usability of the final model. “There’s no free lunch. You have to compromise something,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Machine unlearning may still be at too early a stage for, say, Meta to introduce Ko and Kim’s methods into VoiceBox. But there is likely to be industry interest. Patil is researching unlearning for Google DeepMind this summer, and while Meta did not respond with a comment, it has hesitated for a long time to release VoiceBox to the wider public because it is so vulnerable to misuse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The voice unlearning team seems optimistic that its work could someday get good enough for real-life deployment. “In real applications, we would need faster and more scalable solutions,” says Ko. “We are trying to find those.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/forgetting-audio_94607b.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A technique known as “machine unlearning” could teach AI models to forget specific voices—an important step in stopping the rise of audio deepfakes, where someone’s voice is copied to carry out fraud or scams.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Recent advances in artificial intelligence have revolutionized the quality of text-to-speech technology so that people can convincingly re-create a piece of text in any voice, complete with natural speaking patterns and intonations, instead of having to settle for a robotic voice reading it out word by word. “Anyone’s voice can be reproduced or copied with just a few seconds of their voice,” says Jong Hwan Ko, a professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea and the coauthor of a new paper that demonstrates one of the first applications of machine unlearning to speech generation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Copied voices have been used in scams, disinformation, and harassment.

Machine unlearning instead asks whether an AI can be made to forget a piece of information that the company doesn’t want it to know. It works by taking a model and the specific data to be redacted then using them to create a new model—essentially, a version of the original that never learned that piece of data.&lt;/p&gt;

They will train teachers at a New York City headquarters on how to use AI both for teaching and for tasks like planning lessons and writing reports, starting this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these companies could face an uphill battle.

Friends or family members may disagree over what’s best for their loved one, which can lead to distressing situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Wendler, a bioethicist at the US National Institutes of Health, and his colleagues have been working on an idea for something that could make things easier: an artificial intelligence-based tool that can help surrogates predict what the patients themselves would want in any given situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wendler hopes to start building their tool as soon as they secure funding for it, potentially in the coming months. But rolling it out won’t be simple. Critics wonder how such a tool can ethically be trained on a person’s data, and whether life-or-death decisions should ever be entrusted to AI.

Friends or family members may disagree over what’s best for their loved one, which can lead to distressing situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Wendler, a bioethicist at the US National Institutes of Health, and his colleagues have been working on an idea for something that could make things easier: an artificial intelligence-based tool that can help surrogates predict what the patients themselves would want in any given situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wendler hopes to start building their tool as soon as they secure funding for it, potentially in the coming months. But rolling it out won’t be simple. Critics wonder how such a tool can ethically be trained on a person’s data, and whether life-or-death decisions should ever be entrusted to AI.
