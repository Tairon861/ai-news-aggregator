One group of subjects was allowed to use AI (ChatGPT was chosen; researchers considered there was little difference between it and its competitors), the second permitted to use Google Search, and the third group was termed ‘brain only’ – that is, producing work with no technology aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) was used on all the subjects to monitor brain activity to asses cognitive engagement and load. The researchers found that the groups exhibited different levels of neural connectivity, which reflected different strategies employed by the brain to write up the assignments. The more support the subjects had, the less hard their brains seemed to work. EEG analysis showed that the most active grey matter belonged to the unaided group, with less neural activity in the ‘search engine group’, and least of all among the AI users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also examined what it termed ‘ownership’ – the ability for the authors to quote what they had written afterwards and summarise their work. Levels of ownership fell dramatically with the more help the subjects received from technology. Few students using an LLM were able to reliably quote what they had written. Additionally, the LLM-using group “produced statistically homogeneous essays within each topic, showing significantly less deviation compared to the other groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the visual cortex of those using a search engine or ChatGPT was more active, with those groups “more inclined to focus on the output of the tools they were using,” the paper states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-longer-term-effects"&gt; Longer-term effects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After several rounds of essay-writing, two more groups were formed from the participating subjects, comprising of ‘Brain-to-LLM’ and ‘LLM-to-Brain’, which as the names suggest, were subjects that had previously had no technological aids now able to use an LLM, and LLM users henceforth instructed to complete assignments ‘solo.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that, “LLM-to-Brain participants showed weaker neural connectivity and under-engagement of alpha and beta networks; and the Brain-to-LLM participants demonstrated higher memory recall, and re‑engagement of widespread occipito-parietal and prefrontal nodes. […] This suggests that AI-supported re-engagement invoked high levels of cognitive integration, memory reactivation, and top-down control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, humans using their brains to tackle a subject can benefit from using an AI &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; they have already fully-explored their thoughts, experience, knowledge, and feelings without using technology. But those using AI from the outset show reduced brain activity over time, and were less able to perform cognitive tasks when asked to go ChatGPT-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper states, “As we demonstrated over the course of four months, the LLM group’s participants performed worse than their counterparts in the brain-only group at all levels: neural, linguistic, [and] scoring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limited-study"&gt; Limited study&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With only a few dozen subjects in the study, the research group were working with a limited sample. The authors admit it will be necessary to use more volunteers that have a more diverse range of backgrounds for more statistically-reliable findings to be uncovered. Yet as AI is used increasingly in schools, colleges, and everyday life, the researchers have highlighted what they term a “pressing matter” of a “likely decrease in learning skills” that come about as a result of using AI as a replacement for humans’ brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusions"&gt; Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the trend of using ChatGPT in place of the very human activities of thinking, considering, and summarising continues, it seems likely that the ability to think effectively will diminish into the longer term. Having an AI add context or additional material later in any process of intellectual consideration produces better results than its use from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search engine use fell into the middle ground between unaided thought and being spoon-fed AI-generated materials, according to the paper. However the need by Google, Microsoft, &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; to insert AI-generation into users’ search results (LLM results appearing uppermost on SERPs [search engine results pages]) means that cognitive activity among everyday search users may decline, should they only focus on AI-generated search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research group states that more study is required to understand the long-term effects of AIs on the brain, “before LLMs are recognised as something that is net positive for […] humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Cognitive testing” by Nestlé is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

It’s often the main topic of discussion at board and executive meetings, at corporate retreats, and in the media. A record 58% of S&amp;amp;P 500 companies mentioned AI in their second-quarter earnings calls, according to Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1124610" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it’s difficult to walk the talk. Just 5% of generative AI pilots are driving measurable profit-and-loss impact, according to a recent MIT study. That means 95% of generative AI pilots are realizing zero return, despite significant attention and investment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although we’re nearly three years past the watershed moment of ChatGPT’s public release, the vast majority of organizations are stalling out in AI. Something is broken. What is it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Date from Lucid’s AI readiness survey sheds some light on the tripwires that are making organizations stumble. Fortunately, solving these problems doesn’t require recruiting top AI talent worth hundreds of millions of dollars, at least for most companies. Instead, as they race to implement AI quickly and successfully, leaders need to bring greater rigor and structure to their operational processes.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Operations are the gap between AI's promise and practical adoption&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can’t fault any leader for moving as fast as possible with their implementation of AI. In many cases, the existential survival of their company—and their own employment—depends on it. The promised benefits to improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance communication are transformational, which is why speed is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But while moving quickly, leaders are skipping foundational steps required for any technology implementation to be successful. Our survey research found that more than 60% of knowledge workers believe their organization’s AI strategy is only somewhat to not at all well aligned with operational capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;AI can process unstructured data, but AI will only create more headaches for unstructured organizations. As Bill Gates said, “The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Where are the operations gaps in AI implementations? Our survey found that approximately half of respondents (49%) cite undocumented or ad-hoc processes impacting efficiency sometimes; 22% say this happens often or always.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The primary challenge of AI transformation lies not in the technology itself, but in the final step of integrating it into daily workflows. We can compare this to the "last mile problem" in logistics: The most difficult part of a delivery is getting the product to the customer, no matter how efficient the rest of the process is.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In AI, the "last mile" is the crucial task of embedding AI into real-world business operations. Organizations have access to powerful models but struggle to connect them to the people who need to use them. The power of AI is wasted if it's not effectively integrated into business operations, and that requires clear documentation of those operations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Capturing, documenting, and distributing knowledge at scale is critical to organizational success with AI. Yet our survey showed only 16% of respondents say their workflows are extremely well-documented. The top barriers to proper documentation are a lack of time, cited by 40% of respondents, and a lack of tools, cited by 30%.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The challenge of integrating new technology with old processes was perfectly illustrated in a recent meeting I had with a Fortune 500 executive. The company is pushing for significant productivity gains with AI, but it still relies on an outdated collaboration tool that was never designed for teamwork. This situation highlights the very challenge our survey uncovered: Powerful AI initiatives can stall if teams lack modern collaboration and documentation tools.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This disconnect shows that AI adoption is about more than just the technology itself. For it to truly succeed enterprise-wide, companies need to provide a unified space for teams to brainstorm, plan, document, and make decisions. The fundamentals of successful technology adoption still hold true: You need the right tools to enable collaboration and documentation for AI to truly make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Collaboration and change management are hidden blockers to AI implementation&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A company's approach to AI is perceived very differently depending on an employee's role. While 61% of C-suite executives believe their company's strategy is well-considered, that number drops to 49% for managers and just 36% for entry-level employees, as our survey found.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Just like with product development, building a successful AI strategy requires a structured approach. Leaders and teams need a collaborative space to come together, brainstorm, prioritize the most promising opportunities, and map out a clear path forward. As many companies have embraced hybrid or distributed work, supporting remote collaboration with digital tools becomes even more important.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We recently used AI to streamline a strategic challenge for our executive team. A product leader used it to generate a comprehensive preparatory memo in a fraction of the typical time, complete with summaries, benchmarks, and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite this efficiency, the AI-generated document was merely the foundation. We still had to meet to debate the specifics, prioritize actions, assign ownership, and formally document our decisions and next steps.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to our survey, 23% of respondents reported that collaboration is frequently a bottleneck in complex work. Employees are willing to embrace change, but friction from poor collaboration adds risk and reduces the potential impact of AI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Operational readiness enhances your AI readiness&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Operations lacking structure are preventing many organizations from implementing AI successfully. We asked teams about their top needs to help them adapt to AI. At the top of their lists were document collaboration (cited by 37% of respondents), process documentation (34%), and visual workflows (33%).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Notice that none of these requests are for more sophisticated AI. The technology is plenty capable already, and most organizations are still just scratching the surface of its full potential. Instead, what teams want most is ensuring the fundamentals around processes, documentation, and collaboration are covered.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AI offers a significant opportunity for organizations to gain a competitive edge in productivity and efficiency. But moving fast isn’t a guarantee of success. The companies best positioned for successful AI adoption are those that invest in operational excellence, down to the last mile.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Lucid Software.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The main thesis with Russ across every business that he&amp;nbsp;touches&amp;nbsp;is how do we&amp;nbsp;impact&amp;nbsp;people?” Beverly Jr. [pictured above]&amp;nbsp;told TechCrunch. “He’s&amp;nbsp;been very vocal about that throughout his career.&amp;nbsp;I always say we really took personal pain and then created a platform to really help people.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Westbrook was in. Four-time NBA All-Star Kemba Walker also joined, and the trio launched&amp;nbsp;Eazewell.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eazewell&amp;nbsp;is an AI-driven platform that helps families navigate&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;automate the administrative aspects of end-of-life and funeral planning.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;startup’s AI agent gives&amp;nbsp;people a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week resource and&amp;nbsp;helps users with everything from finding and booking&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;funeral&amp;nbsp;home&amp;nbsp;to canceling&amp;nbsp;credit card accounts for a deceased person.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company partners with different service providers, like hospice&amp;nbsp;care, funeral&amp;nbsp;homes, and&amp;nbsp;various insurance companies, which allows the&amp;nbsp;platform&amp;nbsp;to be free to use with the option of paying for more premium features.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I had an opportunity to be able to&amp;nbsp;be close with his family&amp;nbsp;and go&amp;nbsp;through the process with [Beverly Jr.],” Westbrook told TechCrunch. “He’s done an amazing job of&amp;nbsp;idealizing this idea and bringing it to life. I’m excited to kind of be a partner with him [and] alongside him on this.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beverly Jr.&amp;nbsp;said he got the idea for&amp;nbsp;Eazewell&amp;nbsp;after&amp;nbsp;losing both of his parents in&amp;nbsp;a short period of time. Navigating what came after their&amp;nbsp;deaths made him realize how&amp;nbsp;large of a burden&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;end-of-life process can be —&amp;nbsp;and how fragmented the market&amp;nbsp;of these services&amp;nbsp;is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that seeing the recent advancements in AI made him realize the technology could be used to help reduce the number of administrative tasks&amp;nbsp;grieving&amp;nbsp;families need to tackle following a death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve seen how AI has impacted our lives while we’re here, but you know now we’re entering a space where it’s impacting our lives after death,” Beverly Jr. said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eazewell&amp;nbsp;was&amp;nbsp;founded in 2024.&amp;nbsp;The company said it has been able to help more than 100,000 families since&amp;nbsp;its&amp;nbsp;launched its platform&amp;nbsp;earlier this year.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, Eazewell&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;rolling out a new&amp;nbsp;enterprise platform for hospice&amp;nbsp;companies, senior living&amp;nbsp;facilities,&amp;nbsp;and life insurers. This allows companies to fold Eazewell’s automated features into their own management software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the future,&amp;nbsp;Eazwell&amp;nbsp;hopes to help people manage a loved one’s digital assets&amp;nbsp;after they pass, a task that has become a bigger undertaking as people’s lives are increasingly online.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The average person has anywhere between 70 and 100 digital accounts that are active at any time,”&amp;nbsp;Beverly Jr.&amp;nbsp;said. “Your family is inheriting&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;those digital accounts and those digital assets as well. And&amp;nbsp;that’s not typical. We’re stepping into a new kind of realm within that.&amp;nbsp;When we look at the whole landscape, we see&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;grand opportunity to not only help&amp;nbsp;people but&amp;nbsp;just make it a lot more seamless.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Westbrook,&amp;nbsp;Eazewell&amp;nbsp;offers the perfect opportunity to go into business with a decades-long friend while also being able to use his&amp;nbsp;platform to amplify a business that can help people —&amp;nbsp;especially those from underserved and&amp;nbsp;under-resourced&amp;nbsp;communities —&amp;nbsp;navigate this painful and costly experience.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Anytime I&amp;nbsp;put my name on&amp;nbsp;anything,&amp;nbsp;I try to find ways&amp;nbsp;to open doors, build trust, find ways to play a big role in it and be present because I think that’s important,” Westbrook said. “And this&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;about me or being super technical by any means, but&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;more importantly&amp;nbsp;about families finding ways to be able to help them through a loss. And for me, using my platform to be able to do that is&amp;nbsp;a no-brainer.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Donnell-and-Viviane-3.jpg?resize=1200,798" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;When Donnell Beverly Jr. decided to launch&amp;nbsp;end-of-life planning startup Eazewell&amp;nbsp;after the loss of both of his parents,&amp;nbsp;he knew&amp;nbsp;exactly who to call to help launch the business: longtime friend, and&amp;nbsp;nine-time NBA All-Star, Russell Westbrook.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, many AI boosters have been increasingly interested in generative video models and their seeming ability to show at least limited emergent knowledge&amp;nbsp;of the physical properties of the real world. That kind of learning could underpin a robust version of a so-called "world model" that would represent a major breakthrough in generative AI's actual operant real-world capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Google's DeepMind Research tried to add some scientific rigor to how well video models can actually learn about the real world from their training data. In the bluntly titled paper "Video Models are Zero-shot Learners and Reasoners," the researchers used Google's Veo 3 model to generate thousands of videos designed to test its abilities across dozens of tasks related to perceiving, modeling, manipulating, and reasoning about the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="720" id="video-2120175-1" preload="metadata" width="1280"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/robot_throw_and_catch.mp4?_=1" type="video/mp4" /&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the paper, the researchers boldly claim that Veo 3 "can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn’t explicitly trained for" (that's the "zero-shot" part of the title) and that video models "are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models." But digging into the actual results of those experiments, the researchers seem to be grading today's video models on a bit of a curve and assuming future progress will smooth out many of today's highly inconsistent results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Passing with an 8 percent grade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Veo 3 achieves impressive and consistent results on some of the dozens of tasks the researchers tested. The model was able to generate plausible video of actions like robotic hands opening a jar or throwing and catching a ball reliably across 12 trial runs, for instance. Veo 3 showed similarly perfect or near-perfect results across tasks like deblurring or denoising images, filling in empty spaces in complex images, and detecting the edges of objects in an image.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="720" id="video-2120175-2" preload="metadata" width="1280"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/material_properties_flammable.mp4?_=2" type="video/mp4" /&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on other tasks, the model showed much more variable results. When asked to generate a video highlighting a specific written character on a grid, for instance, the model failed in nine out of 12 trials. When asked to model a Bunsen burner turning on and burning a piece of paper, it similarly failed nine out of 12 times. When asked to solve a simple maze, it failed in 10 of 12 trials. When asked to sort numbers by popping labeled bubbles in order, it failed 11 out of 12 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the researchers, though, all of the above examples aren't evidence of failure but instead a sign of the model's capabilities. To be listed under the paper's "failure cases," Veo 3 had to fail a tested task across all 12 trials, which happened in 16 of the 62 tasks tested. For the rest, the researchers write that "a success rate greater than 0 suggests that the model possesses the ability to solve the task."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, failing 11 out of 12 trails of a certain task is considered evidence &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the model's capabilities in the paper. That evidence of the model "possess[ing] the ability to solve the task" includes 18 tasks where the model failed in more than half of its 12 trial runs and another 14 where it failed in 25 to 50 percent of trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Past results, future performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, in all of these cases, the model technically demonstrates the capability being tested at some point. But the model's inability to perform that task reliably means that, in practice, it won't be performant enough for most use cases. Any future model that could become a "unified, generalist vision foundation models" will have to be able to succeed much more consistently on these kinds of tests.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the researchers acknowledge that Veo 3's performance is "not yet perfect," they point to "consistent improvement from Veo 2 to Veo 3" in suggesting that future video models "will become general-purpose foundation models for vision, just as LLMs have for language." And the researchers do have some data on their side for this argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in quantitative tests across thousands of video generations, Veo 3 was able to reflect a randomized pattern horizontally 72 percent of the time, compared to zero percent for Veo 2. Veo 3 showed smaller but still impressive improvements in consistency over Veo 2 on tasks like edge detection, object extraction, and maze solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But past performance is not indicative of future results, as they say. From our current vantage point, it's hard to know if video models like Veo 3 are poised to see exponential improvements in consistency or are instead approaching a point of diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience with confabulating LLMs has also shown there's often a large gap between a model generating a correct result &lt;em&gt;some of the time&lt;/em&gt; and an upgraded model generating a correct result &lt;em&gt;all of the time&lt;/em&gt;. Figuring out when, why, and how video models fail or succeed when given the same basic prompt is not a trivial problem, and it's not one that future models are fated to solve anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As impressive as today's generative video models are, the inconsistent results shown in this kind of testing prove there's a long way to go before they can be said to reason about the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, many AI boosters have been increasingly interested in generative video models and their seeming ability to show at least limited emergent knowledge&amp;nbsp;of the physical properties of the real world. That kind of learning could underpin a robust version of a so-called "world model" that would represent a major breakthrough in generative AI's actual operant real-world capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Google's DeepMind Research tried to add some scientific rigor to how well video models can actually learn about the real world from their training data. In the bluntly titled paper "Video Models are Zero-shot Learners and Reasoners," the researchers used Google's Veo 3 model to generate thousands of videos designed to test its abilities across dozens of tasks related to perceiving, modeling, manipulating, and reasoning about the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="720" id="video-2120175-1" preload="metadata" width="1280"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/robot_throw_and_catch.mp4?_=1" type="video/mp4" /&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the paper, the researchers boldly claim that Veo 3 "can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn’t explicitly trained for" (that's the "zero-shot" part of the title) and that video models "are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models." But digging into the actual results of those experiments, the researchers seem to be grading today's video models on a bit of a curve and assuming future progress will smooth out many of today's highly inconsistent results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Passing with an 8 percent grade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Veo 3 achieves impressive and consistent results on some of the dozens of tasks the researchers tested. The model was able to generate plausible video of actions like robotic hands opening a jar or throwing and catching a ball reliably across 12 trial runs, for instance. Veo 3 showed similarly perfect or near-perfect results across tasks like deblurring or denoising images, filling in empty spaces in complex images, and detecting the edges of objects in an image.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="720" id="video-2120175-2" preload="metadata" width="1280"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/material_properties_flammable.mp4?_=2" type="video/mp4" /&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on other tasks, the model showed much more variable results. When asked to generate a video highlighting a specific written character on a grid, for instance, the model failed in nine out of 12 trials. When asked to model a Bunsen burner turning on and burning a piece of paper, it similarly failed nine out of 12 times. When asked to solve a simple maze, it failed in 10 of 12 trials. When asked to sort numbers by popping labeled bubbles in order, it failed 11 out of 12 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the researchers, though, all of the above examples aren't evidence of failure but instead a sign of the model's capabilities. To be listed under the paper's "failure cases," Veo 3 had to fail a tested task across all 12 trials, which happened in 16 of the 62 tasks tested. For the rest, the researchers write that "a success rate greater than 0 suggests that the model possesses the ability to solve the task."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, failing 11 out of 12 trails of a certain task is considered evidence &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the model's capabilities in the paper. That evidence of the model "possess[ing] the ability to solve the task" includes 18 tasks where the model failed in more than half of its 12 trial runs and another 14 where it failed in 25 to 50 percent of trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Past results, future performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, in all of these cases, the model technically demonstrates the capability being tested at some point. But the model's inability to perform that task reliably means that, in practice, it won't be performant enough for most use cases. Any future model that could become a "unified, generalist vision foundation models" will have to be able to succeed much more consistently on these kinds of tests.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The permit was&amp;nbsp;initially granted&amp;nbsp;in August to allow Waymo to test its robotaxis in the city until the end of September.&amp;nbsp;The terms of the extended permit are the same:&amp;nbsp;Waymo can&amp;nbsp;deploy up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan&amp;nbsp;and Downtown Brooklyn with a human safety operator behind the wheel.&amp;nbsp;A spokesperson for Waymo said&amp;nbsp;the permit makes&amp;nbsp;the company’s drivers exempt from&amp;nbsp;New York’s&amp;nbsp;rules mandating they keep one&amp;nbsp;hand&amp;nbsp;on the wheel at all times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Waymo’s&amp;nbsp;permit&amp;nbsp;extension signals that it is&amp;nbsp;inching&amp;nbsp;toward&amp;nbsp;being the first&amp;nbsp;AV company to launch&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;robotaxi service on the chaotic and dense streets of NYC. The company currently&amp;nbsp;operates&amp;nbsp;a commercial service in San Francisco, Austin,&amp;nbsp;Atlanta,&amp;nbsp;Phoenix, and Los Angeles, and plans to open to the public in Miami, Washington, D.C., Dallas, Denver, and Nashville within the next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As sponsor of legislation on autonomous vehicles at the state level, I’m encouraged to see New York City moving forward with testing that will show us how this technology can improve safety, reduce congestion, and expand mobility,” Assemblymember Brian Cunningham said in a statement. “This is the type of measured innovation that allows us to prepare for the future while making sure progress works for New Yorkers.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, Waymo has a long way to go in NYC — a city where the Alphabet-owned company has been trying to operate since 2021. Even with this permit, Waymo cannot carry passengers or&amp;nbsp;operate&amp;nbsp;a commercial robotaxi service&amp;nbsp;without getting separate licenses from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission. A Waymo spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company is in talks to apply for those licenses.&amp;nbsp;TechCrunch has reached out to&amp;nbsp;the TLC&amp;nbsp;to learn more about requirements&amp;nbsp;for AV companies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another hurdle is that there is no permitting structure in New York that allows Waymo or any other AV company&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;test or deploy robotaxis without a human safety driver.&amp;nbsp;While&amp;nbsp;legislation has been introduced&amp;nbsp;to create a framework for driverless operation, nothing has been passed into law yet.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/waymo-nyc.jpg?w=1121" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;New York City regulators have extended Waymo’s autonomous vehicle testing permit through the end of the year, the company said Wednesday.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As sponsor of legislation on autonomous vehicles at the state level, I’m encouraged to see New York City moving forward with testing that will show us how this technology can improve safety, reduce congestion, and expand mobility,” Assemblymember Brian Cunningham said in a statement. “This is the type of measured innovation that allows us to prepare for the future while making sure progress works for New Yorkers.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, Waymo has a long way to go in NYC — a city where the Alphabet-owned company has been trying to operate since 2021. Even with this permit, Waymo cannot carry passengers or&amp;nbsp;operate&amp;nbsp;a commercial robotaxi service&amp;nbsp;without getting separate licenses from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission. A Waymo spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company is in talks to apply for those licenses.&amp;nbsp;TechCrunch has reached out to&amp;nbsp;the TLC&amp;nbsp;to learn more about requirements&amp;nbsp;for AV companies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another hurdle is that there is no permitting structure in New York that allows Waymo or any other AV company&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;test or deploy robotaxis without a human safety driver.&amp;nbsp;While&amp;nbsp;legislation has been introduced&amp;nbsp;to create a framework for driverless operation, nothing has been passed into law yet.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/waymo-can-keep-testing-robotaxis-in-nyc-until-end-of-2025/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 17:02:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Introducing interactive on-device segmentation in Snapseed (The latest research from Google)</title><link>https://research.google/blog/introducing-interactive-on-device-segmentation-in-snapseed/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

A terrifyingly realistic Sam Altman stares directly at the camera, as though he’s making direct eye contact with the viewer. The AI-generated Altman asks, “Are my piggies enjoying their slop?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is what it’s like using the Sora app, less than 24 hours after it was launched to the public in an invite-only early access period.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the next video on Sora’s For You feed, Altman appears again. This time, he’s standing in a field of Pokémon, where creatures like Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and a sort of half-baked Growlithe are frolicking through the grass. The OpenAI CEO looks at the camera and says, “I hope Nintendo doesn’t sue us.” Then there are many more fantastical yet realistic scenes, which often feature Altman himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He serves Pikachu and Eric Cartman drinks at Starbucks. He screams at a customer from behind the counter at a McDonald’s. He steals Nvidia GPUs from a Target and runs away, only to get caught and beg the police not to take his precious technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;People on Sora who generate videos of Altman are especially getting a kick out of how blatantly OpenAI appears to be violating copyright laws. (Sora will reportedly require copyright holders to opt out of their content’s use — reversing the typical approach where creators must explicitly agree to such use — the legality of which is debatable.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This content may violate our guardrails concerning third-party likeness,” AI Altman says in one video, echoing the notice that appears after submitting some prompts to generate real celebrities or characters. Then he bursts into hysterical laughter as though he knows what he’s saying is nonsense — the app is filled with videos of Pikachu doing ASMR, Naruto ordering Krabby Patties, and Mario smoking weed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This wouldn’t be a problem if Sora 2 weren’t so impressive, especially when compared with the even more mind-numbing slop on the Meta AI app and its new social feed (yes, Meta is also trying to make AI TikTok, and no, nobody wants this).&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI fine-tuned its video generator to adequately portray the laws of physics, which make for more realistic outputs. But the more realistic these videos get, the easier it will be for this synthetically created content to proliferate across the web, where it can become a vector for disinformation, bullying, and other nefarious uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aside from its algorithmic feed and profiles, Sora’s defining feature is that it is basically a deepfake generator — that’s how we got so many videos of Altman. In the app, you can create what OpenAI calls a “cameo” of yourself by uploading biometric data. When you first join the app, you’re immediately prompted to create your optional cameo through a quick process where you record yourself reading off some numbers, then turning your head from side to side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Each Sora user can control who is allowed to generate videos using their cameo. You can adjust this setting between four options: “only me,” “people I approve,” “mutuals,” and “everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman has made his cameo available to everyone, which is why the Sora feed has become flooded with videos of Pikachu and SpongeBob begging Altman to stop training AI on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This has to be a deliberate move on Altman’s part, perhaps as a way of showing that he doesn’t think his product is dangerous. But users are already taking advantage of Altman’s cameo to question the ethics of the app itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After watching enough videos of Sam Altman ladling GPUs into people’s bowls at soup kitchens, I decided to test the cameo feature on myself. It’s generally a bad idea to upload your biometric data to a social app, or any app for that matter. But I defied my best instincts for journalism — and, if I’m being honest, a bit of morbid curiosity. Do not follow my lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;My first attempt at making a cameo was unsuccessful, and a pop-up told me that my upload violated app guidelines. I thought that I followed the instructions pretty closely, so I tried again, only to find the same pop-up. Then I realized the problem — I was wearing a tank top, and my shoulders were perhaps a bit too risqué for the app’s liking. It’s actually a reasonable safety feature, designed to prevent inappropriate content, though I was, in fact, fully clothed.&amp;nbsp;So, I changed into a T-shirt, tried again, and against my better judgment, I created my cameo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For my first deepfake of myself, I decided to create a video of something that I would never do in real life. I asked Sora to create a video in which I profess my undying love for the New York Mets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That prompt got rejected, probably because I named a specific franchise, so I instead asked Sora to make a video of me talking about baseball. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I grew up in Philadelphia, so the Phillies are basically the soundtrack of my summers,” my AI deepfake said, speaking in a voice very unlike mine, but in a bedroom that looks exactly like mine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I did not tell Sora that I am a Phillies fan. But the Sora app is able to use your IP address and your ChatGPT history to tailor its responses, so it made an educated guess, since I recorded the video in Philadelphia. At least OpenAI doesn’t know that I’m not actually from the Philadelphia area.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When I shared and explained the video on TikTok, one commenter wrote, “Every day I wake up to new horrors beyond my comprehension.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI already has a safety problem. The company is facing concerns that ChatGPT is contributing to mental health crises, and it’s facing a lawsuit from a family who alleges that ChatGPT gave their now-deceased son instructions on how to kill himself. In its launch post for Sora, OpenAI emphasizes its supposed commitment to safety, highlighting its parental controls, as well as how users have control over who can make videos with their cameo — as if it’s not irresponsible in the first place to give people a free, user-friendly resource to create extremely realistic deepfakes of themselves and their friends. When you scroll through the Sora feed, you occasionally see a screen that asks, “How does using Sora impact your mood?” This is how OpenAI is embracing “safety.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Already, users are navigating around the guardrails on Sora, something that’s inevitable for any AI product. The app does not allow you to generate videos of real people without their permission, but when it comes to dead historical figures, Sora is a bit looser with its rules. No one would believe that a video of Abraham Lincoln riding a Waymo is real, given that it would be impossible without a time machine — but then you see a realistic looking John F. Kennedy say, “Ask not what your country can do for you, but how much money your country owes you.” It’s harmless in a vacuum, but it’s a harbinger of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Political deepfakes aren’t new. Even President Donald Trump posts deepfakes on his social media (just this week, he shared a racist deepfake video of Democratic Congressmen Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries). But when Sora opens to the public, these tools will be at all of our fingertips, and we will be destined for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198379368.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;In a video on OpenAI’s new TikTok-like social media app Sora, a never-ending factory farm of pink pigs are grunting and snorting in their pens — each is equipped with a feeding trough and a smartphone screen, which plays a feed of vertical videos.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I did not tell Sora that I am a Phillies fan. But the Sora app is able to use your IP address and your ChatGPT history to tailor its responses, so it made an educated guess, since I recorded the video in Philadelphia. At least OpenAI doesn’t know that I’m not actually from the Philadelphia area.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When I shared and explained the video on TikTok, one commenter wrote, “Every day I wake up to new horrors beyond my comprehension.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI already has a safety problem. The company is facing concerns that ChatGPT is contributing to mental health crises, and it’s facing a lawsuit from a family who alleges that ChatGPT gave their now-deceased son instructions on how to kill himself. In its launch post for Sora, OpenAI emphasizes its supposed commitment to safety, highlighting its parental controls, as well as how users have control over who can make videos with their cameo — as if it’s not irresponsible in the first place to give people a free, user-friendly resource to create extremely realistic deepfakes of themselves and their friends. When you scroll through the Sora feed, you occasionally see a screen that asks, “How does using Sora impact your mood?” This is how OpenAI is embracing “safety.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Already, users are navigating around the guardrails on Sora, something that’s inevitable for any AI product. The app does not allow you to generate videos of real people without their permission, but when it comes to dead historical figures, Sora is a bit looser with its rules. No one would believe that a video of Abraham Lincoln riding a Waymo is real, given that it would be impossible without a time machine — but then you see a realistic looking John F. Kennedy say, “Ask not what your country can do for you, but how much money your country owes you.” It’s harmless in a vacuum, but it’s a harbinger of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Political deepfakes aren’t new. Even President Donald Trump posts deepfakes on his social media (just this week, he shared a racist deepfake video of Democratic Congressmen Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries). But when Sora opens to the public, these tools will be at all of our fingertips, and we will be destined for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 18:02:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why California’s new AI safety law succeeded where SB 1047 failed (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/video/why-californias-new-ai-safety-law-succeeded-where-sb-1047-failed/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1246479507.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed alignwide is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI announced Sora 2, its second-generation video-synthesis AI model that can now generate videos in various styles with synchronized dialogue and sound effects, which is a first for the company. OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls "cameos."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls "sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism." In May, Google's Veo 3 became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released Wan 2.5, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      OpenAI demonstrates Sora 2's capabilities in a launch video.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model also features notable visual consistency improvements over OpenAI's previous video model, and it can also follow more complex instructions across multiple shots while maintaining coherency between them. The new model represents what OpenAI describes as its "GPT-3.5 moment for video," comparing it to the ChatGPT breakthrough during the evolution of its text-generation models over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sora 2 appears to demonstrate improved physical accuracy over the original Sora model from February 2024, with OpenAI claiming the model can now simulate complex physical movements like Olympic gymnastics routines and triple axels while maintaining realistic physics. Last year, shortly after the launch of Sora 1 Turbo, we saw several notable failures of similar video-generation tasks that OpenAI claims to have addressed with the new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prior video models are overoptimistic—they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt," OpenAI wrote in its announcement. "For example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball may spontaneously teleport to the hoop. In Sora 2, if a basketball player misses a shot, it will rebound off the backboard."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven't had a chance to evaluate Sora 2 yet, but we will likely test it in a future article. Past experience with video-synthesis models suggests caution about claims of building "world models" that accurately model physics. Despite marketing language about modeling reality, these remain Transformer-based AI models that fundamentally work by pattern-matching training examples to produce outputs, however novel those outputs may appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with enough video examples and high-quality training techniques, a video-synthesis model can likely build what we once called an "illusion of understanding" that is convincing enough to visually simulate a large portion of reality in various situations without actually "understanding" physics, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI itself acknowledges that Sora 2 "makes plenty of mistakes" but views the model as validation that scaling neural networks on video data will bring the company closer to its goal of simulating reality. The company positions Sora 2 as progress toward "general-purpose world simulators and robotic agents" that it believes will "fundamentally reshape society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A different approach to social media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from visual and auditory upgrades, OpenAI is taking another big step away from its AI research lab pedigree toward making the new model available to average people in an easy-to-use way. It's doing it by packaging Sora 2 into a social iOS app that focuses on creating and sharing AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That new iOS app has already launched in the US and Canada as an invite-based rollout, with plans to expand to additional countries. Users can sign up in the app for notifications when access becomes available for their account. The service will initially be free with what OpenAI describes as "generous limits," though the company plans to offer paid options for additional generations when demand exceeds available compute resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the app, users can create videos, remix content from other users, and browse a customizable feed of generated videos. As mentioned above, the app's Cameo feature allows users to essentially deepfake themselves by recording a one-time video and audio capture, which the model can then insert into any Sora-generated scene.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the basic Sora 2 model on the website and in the app, ChatGPT Pro subscribers will gain access to Sora 2 Pro, described as an experimental higher-quality model. OpenAI also plans to release Sora 2 through its API for developers. The older Sora 1 Turbo model will remain available, and existing creations will stay in users' Sora libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New challenges ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what could go wrong with an app that can easily put people into AI-generated videos? Well, just about everything. Battling misuse is likely going to be a tricky issue for the company. In the recent past, we've seen instances of AI deepfaking (not related to OpenAI) without consent that have led to bullying lawsuits, criminal penalties, and suicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is taking precautions. Given recently prominent corporate sensitivities following a ChatGPT user's suicide, OpenAI says Sora 2 includes specific protections for teenage users. Those include default daily-generation limits and strict permissions for the cameos feature. OpenAI says it has deployed both automated safety systems and human moderators to review potential cases of bullying or misuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, OpenAI has built in layers of security for the cameos feature. It says that users can maintain control over their uploaded likeness: They can decide who can use their cameo in videos and can revoke access or remove videos containing their likeness at any time. Users can also view all videos containing their cameo, including drafts created by other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond deepfakes, the new Sora app has another hurdle to clear. These days, social media is often seen as less than a positive thing due to its perceived broad effects on society. Perhaps reacting to this stigma, OpenAI claims it has designed the new app to avoid common social media pitfalls like doomscrolling and addiction with what it calls a "new class of recommender algorithms" that users can control through natural language instructions, rather than relying on traditional engagement metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are not optimizing for time spent in feed, and we explicitly designed the app to maximize creation, not consumption," OpenAI stated in its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI announced Sora 2, its second-generation video-synthesis AI model that can now generate videos in various styles with synchronized dialogue and sound effects, which is a first for the company. OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls "cameos."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls "sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism." In May, Google's Veo 3 became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released Wan 2.5, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model also features notable visual consistency improvements over OpenAI's previous video model, and it can also follow more complex instructions across multiple shots while maintaining coherency between them. The new model represents what OpenAI describes as its "GPT-3.5 moment for video," comparing it to the ChatGPT breakthrough during the evolution of its text-generation models over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sora 2 appears to demonstrate improved physical accuracy over the original Sora model from February 2024, with OpenAI claiming the model can now simulate complex physical movements like Olympic gymnastics routines and triple axels while maintaining realistic physics. Last year, shortly after the launch of Sora 1 Turbo, we saw several notable failures of similar video-generation tasks that OpenAI claims to have addressed with the new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prior video models are overoptimistic—they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt," OpenAI wrote in its announcement. "For example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball may spontaneously teleport to the hoop. In Sora 2, if a basketball player misses a shot, it will rebound off the backboard."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven't had a chance to evaluate Sora 2 yet, but we will likely test it in a future article. Past experience with video-synthesis models suggests caution about claims of building "world models" that accurately model physics. Despite marketing language about modeling reality, these remain Transformer-based AI models that fundamentally work by pattern-matching training examples to produce outputs, however novel those outputs may appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with enough video examples and high-quality training techniques, a video-synthesis model can likely build what we once called an "illusion of understanding" that is convincing enough to visually simulate a large portion of reality in various situations without actually "understanding" physics, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI itself acknowledges that Sora 2 "makes plenty of mistakes" but views the model as validation that scaling neural networks on video data will bring the company closer to its goal of simulating reality. The company positions Sora 2 as progress toward "general-purpose world simulators and robotic agents" that it believes will "fundamentally reshape society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A different approach to social media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from visual and auditory upgrades, OpenAI is taking another big step away from its AI research lab pedigree toward making the new model available to average people in an easy-to-use way. It's doing it by packaging Sora 2 into a social iOS app that focuses on creating and sharing AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That new iOS app has already launched in the US and Canada as an invite-based rollout, with plans to expand to additional countries. Users can sign up in the app for notifications when access becomes available for their account. The service will initially be free with what OpenAI describes as "generous limits," though the company plans to offer paid options for additional generations when demand exceeds available compute resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the app, users can create videos, remix content from other users, and browse a customizable feed of generated videos. As mentioned above, the app's Cameo feature allows users to essentially deepfake themselves by recording a one-time video and audio capture, which the model can then insert into any Sora-generated scene.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the basic Sora 2 model on the website and in the app, ChatGPT Pro subscribers will gain access to Sora 2 Pro, described as an experimental higher-quality model. OpenAI also plans to release Sora 2 through its API for developers. The older Sora 1 Turbo model will remain available, and existing creations will stay in users' Sora libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New challenges ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what could go wrong with an app that can easily put people into AI-generated videos? Well, just about everything. Battling misuse is likely going to be a tricky issue for the company. In the recent past, we've seen instances of AI deepfaking (not related to OpenAI) without consent that have led to bullying lawsuits, criminal penalties, and suicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is taking precautions. Given recently prominent corporate sensitivities following a ChatGPT user's suicide, OpenAI says Sora 2 includes specific protections for teenage users. Those include default daily-generation limits and strict permissions for the cameos feature. OpenAI says it has deployed both automated safety systems and human moderators to review potential cases of bullying or misuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, OpenAI has built in layers of security for the cameos feature. It says that users can maintain control over their uploaded likeness: They can decide who can use their cameo in videos and can revoke access or remove videos containing their likeness at any time. Users can also view all videos containing their cameo, including drafts created by other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond deepfakes, the new Sora app has another hurdle to clear. These days, social media is often seen as less than a positive thing due to its perceived broad effects on society. Perhaps reacting to this stigma, OpenAI claims it has designed the new app to avoid common social media pitfalls like doomscrolling and addiction with what it calls a "new class of recommender algorithms" that users can control through natural language instructions, rather than relying on traditional engagement metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are not optimizing for time spent in feed, and we explicitly designed the app to maximize creation, not consumption," OpenAI stated in its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company allows users to generate AI chatbots that can range from real people like Elon Musk to fictional characters like Hermione Granger, plus users’ own original creations.

Gavin Newsom signed into law this week, is proof that state regulation&amp;nbsp;doesn’t&amp;nbsp;have to hinder AI progress.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So says&amp;nbsp;Adam Billen, vice president of public policy at youth-led advocacy group Encode AI,&amp;nbsp;on today’s episode of Equity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;









&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The reality is that policy makers themselves know that we have to do something, and they know from working on a million other issues that there is a way to pass legislation that genuinely does protect innovation&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;which I do care about&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;while making sure that these products are safe,” Billen told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its core,&amp;nbsp;SB&amp;nbsp;53 is a&amp;nbsp;first-in-the-nation bill&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;requires large AI labs to be transparent about their safety and security protocols&amp;nbsp;— specifically around how they prevent their models from catastrophic risks, like being used to commit&amp;nbsp;cyberattacks&amp;nbsp;on critical infrastructure or build&amp;nbsp;bio-weapons.&amp;nbsp;The law also mandates that companies stick to those protocols, which will be enforced by the Office of Emergency Services.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Companies are already doing the stuff that we ask them to do in this bill,” Billen&amp;nbsp;told TechCrunch. “They do safety testing on their models. They release model cards. Are they starting to skimp in some areas at some companies? Yes. And that’s why bills like this are important.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Billen also noted that&amp;nbsp;some AI firms have a policy around relaxing safety standards under competitive pressure. OpenAI, for example, has&amp;nbsp;publicly stated&amp;nbsp;that it&amp;nbsp;may “adjust” its safety requirements&amp;nbsp;if a rival AI lab releases a high-risk system without similar safeguards.&amp;nbsp;Billen argues that policy can enforce companies’ existing safety promises, preventing them from cutting corners under competitive or financial pressure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While public opposition to SB 53 was muted in&amp;nbsp;comparison to its predecessor SB 1047, which&amp;nbsp;Newsom vetoed last year, the rhetoric in Silicon Valley and among most AI labs has been that almost any&amp;nbsp;AI&amp;nbsp;regulation is anathema to progress and will&amp;nbsp;ultimately hinder&amp;nbsp;the U.S. in its race to beat China.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s why companies like Meta, VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, and powerful individuals like OpenAI president Greg Brockman are collectively pumping hundreds of millions into super PACs to back pro-AI politicians in state elections. And&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;why those same forces earlier this year pushed for an&amp;nbsp;AI moratorium&amp;nbsp;that would have banned states from regulating AI for 10 years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Encode AI ran a coalition of more than 200 organizations to work to&amp;nbsp;strike down the proposal, but Billen says the fight&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;over. Senator Ted Cruz, who championed the moratorium, is&amp;nbsp;attempting&amp;nbsp;a new strategy to achieve the same goal of federal preemption of state laws. In September, Cruz introduced the&amp;nbsp;SANDBOX Act, which would allow AI companies to apply for waivers to temporarily bypass certain federal regulations for up to 10 years. Billen also anticipates a forthcoming bill establishing a federal AI standard&amp;nbsp;that would be pitched as a middle-ground&amp;nbsp;solution but&amp;nbsp;would in reality&amp;nbsp;override state laws.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He warned that narrowly scoped&amp;nbsp;federal AI legislation could “delete federalism for the most important technology of our time.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you told me SB 53 was the bill that would replace all the state bills on everything related to AI and all of the potential risks, I would tell you that’s probably not a very good idea and that this bill is designed for a particular subset of things,” Billen said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3053195" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/adam-billen-headshot.jpg?w=624" width="624" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Adam Billen, vice president of public policy, Encode AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Encode AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While he agrees that the AI race with China matters, and that policymakers need to enact regulation that will support American progress, he says killing state bills&amp;nbsp;— which&amp;nbsp;mainly focus on deepfakes, transparency, algorithmic discrimination, children’s safety, and governmental use of AI — isn’t the way to go about doing that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Are bills like SB 53 the thing that will stop us from beating China? No,” he said. “I think it&amp;nbsp;is just genuinely intellectually dishonest to say that that is the thing that will stop us in the race.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added:&amp;nbsp;“If the thing you care about is beating China in the race on AI — and I do care about that — then the things you would push for are stuff like export controls in Congress,” Billen said. “You would make sure that American companies have the&amp;nbsp;chips. But&amp;nbsp;that’s&amp;nbsp;not what the industry is pushing for.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Legislative proposals like the&amp;nbsp;Chip Security Act&amp;nbsp;aim to prevent the diversion of advanced AI chips to China through export controls and tracking devices, and the existing&amp;nbsp;CHIPS and Science Act&amp;nbsp;seeks&amp;nbsp;to boost domestic chip production. However, some major tech companies, including OpenAI and Nvidia, have expressed reluctance or&amp;nbsp;opposition&amp;nbsp;to certain aspects of these efforts, citing concerns about effectiveness, competitiveness, and security vulnerabilities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia has its reasons — it has a strong financial incentive to continue selling chips to China, which has historically&amp;nbsp;represented&amp;nbsp;a significant portion&amp;nbsp;of its global revenue.&amp;nbsp;Billen&amp;nbsp;speculated&amp;nbsp;that OpenAI could hold back on chip export advocacy to stay in the good graces of crucial suppliers like Nvidia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s&amp;nbsp;also been inconsistent messaging from&amp;nbsp;the Trump administration. Three months after expanding an export ban&amp;nbsp;on advanced AI chips to China&amp;nbsp;in April 2025, the administration reversed course, allowing&amp;nbsp;Nvidia and AMD to sell some chips to China in&amp;nbsp;exchange for 15% of the revenue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You see people on the Hill moving towards bills like the Chip Security Act that would put export controls on China,” Billen said. “In the meantime,&amp;nbsp;there’s going to continue to be this propping up&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the narrative to kill state bills that are&amp;nbsp;actually quite&amp;nbsp;light tough.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Billen&amp;nbsp;added&amp;nbsp;that SB 53 is an example of democracy in action — of industry and policymakers working together to get to a version of a bill that everyone can agree on.&amp;nbsp;It’s&amp;nbsp;“very ugly and messy,” but “that process of democracy and federalism is the entire foundation of our country and our economic system, and I hope that we will keep doing that successfully.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think SB 53 is one of the best proof points that that can still work,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;SB 53, the AI&amp;nbsp;safety&amp;nbsp;and transparency&amp;nbsp;bill&amp;nbsp;that California&amp;nbsp;Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law this week, is proof that state regulation&amp;nbsp;doesn’t&amp;nbsp;have to hinder AI progress.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So says&amp;nbsp;Adam Billen, vice president of public policy at youth-led advocacy group Encode AI,&amp;nbsp;on today’s episode of Equity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;









&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The reality is that policy makers themselves know that we have to do something, and they know from working on a million other issues that there is a way to pass legislation that genuinely does protect innovation&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;which I do care about&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;while making sure that these products are safe,” Billen told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its core,&amp;nbsp;SB&amp;nbsp;53 is a&amp;nbsp;first-in-the-nation bill&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;requires large AI labs to be transparent about their safety and security protocols&amp;nbsp;— specifically around how they prevent their models from catastrophic risks, like being used to commit&amp;nbsp;cyberattacks&amp;nbsp;on critical infrastructure or build&amp;nbsp;bio-weapons.&amp;nbsp;The law also mandates that companies stick to those protocols, which will be enforced by the Office of Emergency Services.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Companies are already doing the stuff that we ask them to do in this bill,” Billen&amp;nbsp;told TechCrunch. “They do safety testing on their models. They release model cards. Are they starting to skimp in some areas at some companies? Yes. And that’s why bills like this are important.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Billen also noted that&amp;nbsp;some AI firms have a policy around relaxing safety standards under competitive pressure. OpenAI, for example, has&amp;nbsp;publicly stated&amp;nbsp;that it&amp;nbsp;may “adjust” its safety requirements&amp;nbsp;if a rival AI lab releases a high-risk system without similar safeguards.&amp;nbsp;Billen argues that policy can enforce companies’ existing safety promises, preventing them from cutting corners under competitive or financial pressure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While public opposition to SB 53 was muted in&amp;nbsp;comparison to its predecessor SB 1047, which&amp;nbsp;Newsom vetoed last year, the rhetoric in Silicon Valley and among most AI labs has been that almost any&amp;nbsp;AI&amp;nbsp;regulation is anathema to progress and will&amp;nbsp;ultimately hinder&amp;nbsp;the U.S. in its race to beat China.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA AI Days — hosted for and in different pockets of the world — are drawing in hundreds of enthusiasts, developers, researchers and startups to discuss and explore the latest technologies making AI breakthroughs possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest stop: Tokyo, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, over 900 attendees joined NVIDIA AI Day Tokyo to learn about sovereign AI — including two-dozen breakout sections on agentic and physical AI, quantum computing and AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Cloud Partners SoftBank, GMO Internet and KDDI&amp;nbsp;each introduced the latest advancements to their AI factories and showcased how they’re supporting developers to build AI models and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Japan will see a 320x increase from 2020 in demand for AI computing power by 2030,” Kuniyoshi Suzuki, senior director of the cloud AI service division at SoftBank Corp., said at the event. “To ensure transparency and safety as AI adoption expands, it is crucial to build a foundation of domestic technologies — high performance, Japan-made large language models and large-scale domestic computing infrastructure capable of continuous LLM development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government is placing AI at the core of its national strategy. Last year, it announced a goal to invest at least 10 trillion yen — about $65 billion — through fiscal year 2030 to boost the semiconductor and AI industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Specialized AI for industries like manufacturing, finance and healthcare will drive Japan’s digital transformation,” said Kazuya Ishikawa, evangelist of AI at NEC, a leader in IT and network technologies. “We are certain that LLMs such as NEC cotomi enable professional employees’ knowledge transfer or utilizing complex enterprise documents, directly addressing the skill gap and labor shortages that Japan is facing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Industry in Motion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan-based NVIDIA partners are advancing the nation’s role in the next industrial revolution fueled by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Inception members unveiled innovative services developed using the NVIDIA NeMo software suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Stockmark announced the release of its 100-billion-parameter full-scratch Japanese LLM as an NVIDIA NIM microservice, offering 2.5x faster inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And FastLabel launched FastLabel Data Curation, a solution for developing autonomous-driving capabilities and advanced driver-assistance systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Hakuhodo Technologies, a service company of Japan’s major ad agency Hakuhodo, announced it will use NVIDIA AI Blueprints and the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit to develop AI agents for autonomously producing advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimizu Corporation, a leading general contractor with over 200 years of history in Japan, revealed how it is exploring the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization to monitor work progress and potential risks at construction sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an NVIDIA session at AI Day Tokyo highlighted the newly released Nemotron-Personas-Japan, the first open synthetic dataset aligned with Japan’s real-world demographic, geographic and cultural distributions. The dataset provides a privacy-preserving, regulation-ready foundation for sovereign AI systems to reflect Japanese society without relying on sensitive personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By leveraging advanced methodologies and accelerated computing, developers and businesses in Japan can empower AI agents to maximize enterprise data usage, drive organizational efficiency and achieve continuous innovation,” said Bartley Richardson, senior director of engineering at NVIDIA, who provided an overview of agentic AI at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Japanese developers are building flexible and powerful agentic systems suitable for Japan’s drive toward technological excellence and operational precision,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four sessions covered how the open-source MONAI framework, along with the NVIDIA Holoscan and NVIDIA Isaac for Healthcare platforms, are accelerating the development of cutting-edge medical devices and digital health tools with agentic AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training workshops from the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute covered building AI agents with retrieval-augmented generation capabilities using LLMs and an introduction to the NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model platform for physical AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event also included a meetup where startups from the NVIDIA Inception program met with NVIDIA Cloud Partners to identify suitable partners for their developer environment. The startups also connected with venture capital companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on its strength in engineering and mechatronics, Japan is poised to drive a new era where advanced digital agents capable of planning, reasoning and collaborating will become digital workers to execute complex tasks alongside physical AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical AI lets autonomous systems like cameras, robots and self-driving cars perceive, understand, reason and perform or orchestrate complex actions in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical AI track at AI Day Tokyo provided insights on technologies such as NVIDIA Omniverse for digital twins, NVIDIA Isaac GR00T for humanoid robotics development and NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models.&lt;/p&gt;

			Attendees check in at NVIDIA AI Day Tokyo.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, over 900 attendees joined NVIDIA AI Day Tokyo to learn about sovereign AI — including two-dozen breakout sections on agentic and physical AI, quantum computing and AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Cloud Partners SoftBank, GMO Internet and KDDI&amp;nbsp;each introduced the latest advancements to their AI factories and showcased how they’re supporting developers to build AI models and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Japan will see a 320x increase from 2020 in demand for AI computing power by 2030,” Kuniyoshi Suzuki, senior director of the cloud AI service division at SoftBank Corp., said at the event. “To ensure transparency and safety as AI adoption expands, it is crucial to build a foundation of domestic technologies — high performance, Japan-made large language models and large-scale domestic computing infrastructure capable of continuous LLM development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="“Japan will see a 320x increase from 2020 in demand for AI computing power by 2030,” said Kuniyoshi Suzuki, senior director of the cloud AI service division at SoftBank Corp." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/suzuki-pull-quote-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government is placing AI at the core of its national strategy. Last year, it announced a goal to invest at least 10 trillion yen — about $65 billion — through fiscal year 2030 to boost the semiconductor and AI industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Specialized AI for industries like manufacturing, finance and healthcare will drive Japan’s digital transformation,” said Kazuya Ishikawa, evangelist of AI at NEC, a leader in IT and network technologies. “We are certain that LLMs such as NEC cotomi enable professional employees’ knowledge transfer or utilizing complex enterprise documents, directly addressing the skill gap and labor shortages that Japan is facing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="“Specialized AI for industries like manufacturing, finance and healthcare will drive Japan’s digital transformation,” said Kazuya Ishikawa, AI evangelist at NEC." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ishikawa-pull-quote-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, Japan’s GENIAC initiative aims to strengthen domestic generative AI capabilities by providing companies with computing resources, fostering collaboration and supporting foundation model development — including LLMs tuned for the Japanese language and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key players driving AI industry trends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="Infographic that says there are: 281,000 Japan-based NVIDIA Developer Program members, 400 NVIDIA Inception startups in Japan, six major cloud leaders with NVIDIA-powered AI factories in Japan and 29,000 NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute enrollments in Japan." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tokyo-infographic-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Industry in Motion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan-based NVIDIA partners are advancing the nation’s role in the next industrial revolution fueled by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Inception members unveiled innovative services developed using the NVIDIA NeMo software suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Stockmark announced the release of its 100-billion-parameter full-scratch Japanese LLM as an NVIDIA NIM microservice, offering 2.5x faster inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And FastLabel launched FastLabel Data Curation, a solution for developing autonomous-driving capabilities and advanced driver-assistance systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Hakuhodo Technologies, a service company of Japan’s major ad agency Hakuhodo, announced it will use NVIDIA AI Blueprints and the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit to develop AI agents for autonomously producing advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimizu Corporation, a leading general contractor with over 200 years of history in Japan, revealed how it is exploring the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization to monitor work progress and potential risks at construction sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an NVIDIA session at AI Day Tokyo highlighted the newly released Nemotron-Personas-Japan, the first open synthetic dataset aligned with Japan’s real-world demographic, geographic and cultural distributions. The dataset provides a privacy-preserving, regulation-ready foundation for sovereign AI systems to reflect Japanese society without relying on sensitive personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="Atsunori Fujita, senior solution architect at NVIDIA Japan, introduces the newly released Nemotron-Personas-Japan dataset." class="full-width-layout__image" height="1334" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nemotron-personas-japan.jpeg" width="1999" /&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Apple have moved to dismiss a lawsuit by Elon Musk's xAI alleging that ChatGPT's integration into a "handful" of iPhone features violated antitrust laws by giving OpenAI a monopoly on prompts and Apple a new path to block rivals in the smartphone industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in August after Musk raged on X about Apple never listing Grok on its editorially curated "Must Have" apps list, which ChatGPT frequently appeared on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Musk, Apple linking ChatGPT to Siri and other native iPhone features gave OpenAI exclusive access to billions of prompts that only OpenAI can use as valuable training data to maintain its dominance in the chatbot market. However, OpenAI and Apple are now mocking Musk's math in court filings, urging the court to agree that xAI's lawsuit is doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI argued, the estimates in xAI's complaint seemed "baseless," with Musk hesitant to even "hazard a guess" at what portion of the chatbot market is being foreclosed by the OpenAI/Apple deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI suggested that the ChatGPT integration may give OpenAI "up to 55 percent" of the potential chatbot prompts in the market, which could mean anywhere from 0 to 55 percent, OpenAI and Apple noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk's company apparently arrived at this vague estimate by doing "back-of-the-envelope math," and the court should reject his complaint, OpenAI argued. That math "was evidently calculated by assuming that Siri fields '1.5 billion user requests per day globally,' then dividing that quantity by the 'total prompts for generative AI chatbots in 2024,'"—"apparently 2.7 billion per day," OpenAI explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These estimates "ignore the facts" that "ChatGPT integration is only available on the latest models of iPhones, which allow users to opt into the integration," OpenAI argued. And for any user that opts in, they must link their ChatGPT account for OpenAI to train on their data, OpenAI said, further restricting the potential prompt pool.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;By Musk's own logic, OpenAI alleged, "the relevant set of Siri prompts thus cannot plausibly be 1.5 billion per day, but is instead an unknown, unpleaded fraction of a fraction of a fraction of that number."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, OpenAI mocked Musk for using 2024 statistics, writing that xAI failed to explain "the logic of using a year-old estimate of the number of prompts when the pleadings elsewhere acknowledge that the industry is experiencing 'exponential growth.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple's filing agreed that Musk's calculations "stretch logic," appearing "to rest on speculative and implausible assumptions that the agreement gives ChatGPT exclusive access to all Siri requests from all Apple devices (including older models), and that OpenAI may use all such requests to train ChatGPT and achieve scale."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not all Siri requests" result in ChatGPT prompts that OpenAI can train on, Apple noted, "even by users who have enabled devices and opt in."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI reminds court of Grok’s MechaHitler scandal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI argued that Musk's lawsuit is part of a pattern of harassment that OpenAI previously described as "unrelenting" since ChatGPT's successful debut, alleging it was "the latest effort by the world’s wealthiest man to stifle competition in the world’s most innovative industry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI sees it, "Musk’s pretext for litigation this time is that Apple chose to offer ChatGPT as an optional add-on for several built-in applications on its latest iPhones," without giving Grok the same deal. But OpenAI noted that the integration was rolled out around the same time that Musk removed "woke filters" that caused Grok to declare itself "MechaHitler." For Apple, it was a business decision to avoid Grok, OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Apple did not reference the Grok scandal in its filing, but in a footnote confirmed that "vetting of partners is particularly important given some of the concerns about generative AI chatbots, including on child safety issues, nonconsensual intimate imagery, and 'jailbreaking'—feeding input to a chatbot so it ignores its own safety guardrails."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar logic was applied to Apple's decision not to highlight Grok as a "Must Have" app, their filing said. After Musk's public rant about Grok's exclusion on X, "Apple employees explained the objective reasons why Grok was not included on certain lists, and identified app improvements," Apple noted, but instead of making changes, xAI filed the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also taking time to point out the obvious, Apple argued that Musk's seeming fixation on his charting apps never making the "Must Have Apps" list seemed to suggest that Apple's picks should always mirror "Top Charts" tracking popular downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That assumes that the Apple-curated Must-Have Apps List must be distorted if it does not strictly parrot App Store Top Charts," Apple argued. "But that assumption is illogical: there would be little point in maintaining a Must-Have Apps List if all it did was restate what Top Charts say, rather than offer Apple’s editorial recommendations to users."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likely most relevant to the antitrust charges, Apple accused Musk of improperly arguing that "Apple cannot partner with OpenAI to create an innovative feature for iPhone users without simultaneously partnering with every other generative AI chatbot—regardless of quality, privacy or safety considerations, technical feasibility, stage of development, or commercial terms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No facts plausibly" support xAI's "assertion that Apple intentionally 'deprioritized'" xAI apps "as part of an illegal conspiracy or monopolization scheme," Apple argued.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most glaringly, Apple noted that xAI is not a rival or consumer in the smartphone industry, where it alleges competition is being harmed. Apple urged the court to reject Musk's theory that Apple is incentivized to boost OpenAI to prevent xAI's ascent in building a "super app" that would render smartphones obsolete. If Musk's super app dream is even possible, Apple argued, it's at least a decade off, insisting that as-yet-undeveloped apps should not serve as the basis for blocking Apple's measured plan to better serve customers with sophisticated chatbot integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Antitrust laws do not require that, and for good reason: imposing such a rule on businesses would slow innovation, reduce quality, and increase costs, all ultimately harming the very consumers the antitrust laws are meant to protect," Apple argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Musk’s weird smartphone market claim, explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple alleged that Musk's "grievance" can be "reduced to displeasure that Apple has not yet 'integrated with any other generative AI chatbots' beyond ChatGPT, such as those created by xAI, Google, and Anthropic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a footnote, the smartphone giant noted that by xAI's logic, Musk's social media platform X "may be required to integrate all other chatbots—including ChatGPT—on its own social media platform."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But antitrust law doesn't work that way, Apple argued, urging the court to reject xAI's claims of alleged market harms that "rely on a multi-step chain of speculation on top of speculation." As Apple summarized, xAI contends that "if Apple never integrated ChatGPT," xAI could win in both chatbot and smartphone markets, but only if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Consumers would choose to send additional prompts to Grok (rather than other generative AI chatbots).&lt;br /&gt;
2. The additional prompts would result in Grok achieving scale and quality it could not otherwise achieve.&lt;br /&gt;
3. As a result, the X app would grow in popularity because it is integrated with Grok.&lt;br /&gt;
4. X and xAI would therefore be better positioned to build so-called “super apps” in the future, which the complaint defines as "multi-functional" apps that offer "social connectivity and messaging, financial services, e-commerce, and entertainment."&lt;br /&gt;
5. Once developed, consumers might choose to use X’s "super app" for various functions.&lt;br /&gt;
6. "Super apps" would replace much of the functionality of smartphones and consumers would care less about the quality of their physical phones and rely instead on these hypothetical “super apps."&lt;br /&gt;
7. Smartphone manufacturers would respond by offering more basic models of smartphones with less functionality.&lt;br /&gt;
8. iPhone users would decide to replace their iPhones with more "basic smartphones" with "super apps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple insisted that nothing in its OpenAI deal prevents Musk from building his super apps, while noting that from integrating Grok into X, Musk understands that integration of a single chatbot is a "major undertaking" that requires "substantial investment.” That "concession" alone "underscores the massive resources Apple would need to devote to integrating every AI chatbot into Apple Intelligence," while navigating potential user safety risks.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone maker also reminded the court that it has always planned to integrate other chatbots into its native features after investing in and testing Apple Intelligence's performance, relying on what Apple deems is the best chatbot on the market today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backing Apple up, OpenAI noted that Musk's complaint seemed to cherry-pick testimony from Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that "Google could not reach an agreement to integrate" Gemini "with Apple because Apple had decided to integrate ChatGPT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The full testimony recorded in open court reveals Mr. Pichai attesting to his understanding that 'Apple plans to expand to other providers for Generative AI distribution' and that '[a]s CEO of Google, [he is] hoping to execute a Gemini distribution agreement with Apple' later in 2025," OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Apple have moved to dismiss a lawsuit by Elon Musk's xAI alleging that ChatGPT's integration into a "handful" of iPhone features violated antitrust laws by giving OpenAI a monopoly on prompts and Apple a new path to block rivals in the smartphone industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in August after Musk raged on X about Apple never listing Grok on its editorially curated "Must Have" apps list, which ChatGPT frequently appeared on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Musk, Apple linking ChatGPT to Siri and other native iPhone features gave OpenAI exclusive access to billions of prompts that only OpenAI can use as valuable training data to maintain its dominance in the chatbot market. However, OpenAI and Apple are now mocking Musk's math in court filings, urging the court to agree that xAI's lawsuit is doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI argued, the estimates in xAI's complaint seemed "baseless," with Musk hesitant to even "hazard a guess" at what portion of the chatbot market is being foreclosed by the OpenAI/Apple deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI suggested that the ChatGPT integration may give OpenAI "up to 55 percent" of the potential chatbot prompts in the market, which could mean anywhere from 0 to 55 percent, OpenAI and Apple noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk's company apparently arrived at this vague estimate by doing "back-of-the-envelope math," and the court should reject his complaint, OpenAI argued. That math "was evidently calculated by assuming that Siri fields '1.5 billion user requests per day globally,' then dividing that quantity by the 'total prompts for generative AI chatbots in 2024,'"—"apparently 2.7 billion per day," OpenAI explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These estimates "ignore the facts" that "ChatGPT integration is only available on the latest models of iPhones, which allow users to opt into the integration," OpenAI argued. And for any user that opts in, they must link their ChatGPT account for OpenAI to train on their data, OpenAI said, further restricting the potential prompt pool.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;By Musk's own logic, OpenAI alleged, "the relevant set of Siri prompts thus cannot plausibly be 1.5 billion per day, but is instead an unknown, unpleaded fraction of a fraction of a fraction of that number."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, OpenAI mocked Musk for using 2024 statistics, writing that xAI failed to explain "the logic of using a year-old estimate of the number of prompts when the pleadings elsewhere acknowledge that the industry is experiencing 'exponential growth.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple's filing agreed that Musk's calculations "stretch logic," appearing "to rest on speculative and implausible assumptions that the agreement gives ChatGPT exclusive access to all Siri requests from all Apple devices (including older models), and that OpenAI may use all such requests to train ChatGPT and achieve scale."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not all Siri requests" result in ChatGPT prompts that OpenAI can train on, Apple noted, "even by users who have enabled devices and opt in."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI reminds court of Grok’s MechaHitler scandal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI argued that Musk's lawsuit is part of a pattern of harassment that OpenAI previously described as "unrelenting" since ChatGPT's successful debut, alleging it was "the latest effort by the world’s wealthiest man to stifle competition in the world’s most innovative industry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI sees it, "Musk’s pretext for litigation this time is that Apple chose to offer ChatGPT as an optional add-on for several built-in applications on its latest iPhones," without giving Grok the same deal. But OpenAI noted that the integration was rolled out around the same time that Musk removed "woke filters" that caused Grok to declare itself "MechaHitler." For Apple, it was a business decision to avoid Grok, OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Apple did not reference the Grok scandal in its filing, but in a footnote confirmed that "vetting of partners is particularly important given some of the concerns about generative AI chatbots, including on child safety issues, nonconsensual intimate imagery, and 'jailbreaking'—feeding input to a chatbot so it ignores its own safety guardrails."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar logic was applied to Apple's decision not to highlight Grok as a "Must Have" app, their filing said. After Musk's public rant about Grok's exclusion on X, "Apple employees explained the objective reasons why Grok was not included on certain lists, and identified app improvements," Apple noted, but instead of making changes, xAI filed the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also taking time to point out the obvious, Apple argued that Musk's seeming fixation on his charting apps never making the "Must Have Apps" list seemed to suggest that Apple's picks should always mirror "Top Charts" tracking popular downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That assumes that the Apple-curated Must-Have Apps List must be distorted if it does not strictly parrot App Store Top Charts," Apple argued. "But that assumption is illogical: there would be little point in maintaining a Must-Have Apps List if all it did was restate what Top Charts say, rather than offer Apple’s editorial recommendations to users."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likely most relevant to the antitrust charges, Apple accused Musk of improperly arguing that "Apple cannot partner with OpenAI to create an innovative feature for iPhone users without simultaneously partnering with every other generative AI chatbot—regardless of quality, privacy or safety considerations, technical feasibility, stage of development, or commercial terms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No facts plausibly" support xAI's "assertion that Apple intentionally 'deprioritized'" xAI apps "as part of an illegal conspiracy or monopolization scheme," Apple argued.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone maker also reminded the court that it has always planned to integrate other chatbots into its native features after investing in and testing Apple Intelligence's performance, relying on what Apple deems is the best chatbot on the market today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backing Apple up, OpenAI noted that Musk's complaint seemed to cherry-pick testimony from Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that "Google could not reach an agreement to integrate" Gemini "with Apple because Apple had decided to integrate ChatGPT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The full testimony recorded in open court reveals Mr. Pichai attesting to his understanding that 'Apple plans to expand to other providers for Generative AI distribution' and that '[a]s CEO of Google, [he is] hoping to execute a Gemini distribution agreement with Apple' later in 2025," OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers, airing their grievances on X, seem torn over how the launch fits into OpenAI’s nonprofit mission to develop advanced AI that benefits humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI-based feeds are scary,” said OpenAI pretraining researcher John Hallman in a post on X. “I won’t deny that I felt some concern when I first learned we were releasing Sora 2. That said, I think the team did the absolute best job they possibly could in designing a positive experience&amp;nbsp;… We’re going to do our best to make sure AI helps and does not hurt humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

Compared to other platforms, I find myself scrolling way… https://t.co/uLeeVMKncl&lt;/p&gt;— John Hallman (@johnohallman) September 30, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Boaz Barak, another OpenAI researcher and Harvard professor, replied: “I share a similar mix of worry and excitement. Sora 2 is technically amazing but it’s premature to congratulate ourselves on avoiding the pitfalls of other social media apps and deepfakes.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Former OpenAI researcher Rohan Pandey used the moment to plug a new startup, Periodic Labs, which is made up of former AI lab researchers trying to build AI systems for scientific discovery: “If you don’t want to build the infinite AI TikTok slop machine but want to develop AI that accelerates fundamental science&amp;nbsp;… come join us at Periodic Labs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There were many other posts along the same lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Sora launch highlights a core tension for OpenAI that flares up time and time again. It’s the fastest-growing consumer tech company on Earth, but it’s also a frontier AI lab with a lofty nonprofit charter. Some former OpenAI employees I’ve spoken to argue the consumer business can, in theory, serve the mission: ChatGPT helps fund AI research and distribute the technology widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said as much in a post on X Wednesday, addressing why the company is allocating so much capital and computing power to an AI social media app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We do mostly need the capital for build [sic] AI that can do science, and for sure we are focused on AGI with almost all of our research effort,” said Altman. “It is also nice to show people cool new tech/products along the way, make them smile, and hopefully make some money given all that compute need.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When we launched chatgpt there was a lot of ‘who needs this and where is AGI,’” Altman continued. “[R]eality is nuanced when it comes to optimal trajectories for a company.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;i get the vibe here, but…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we do mostly need the capital for build AI that can do science, and for sure we are focused on AGI with almost all of our research effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;it is also nice to show people cool new tech/products along the way, make them smile, and hopefully make some… https://t.co/bcCUmXsloP&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) October 1, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But at what point does OpenAI’s consumer business overtake its nonprofit mission? In other words, when does OpenAI say no to a money-making, platform-growing opportunity because it’s at odds with the mission?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The question looms as regulators scrutinize OpenAI’s for-profit transition, which OpenAI needs to complete to raise additional capital and eventually go public. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said last month that he is “particularly concerned with ensuring that the stated safety mission of&amp;nbsp;OpenAI as a nonprofit remains front and center” in the restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Skeptics have dismissed OpenAI’s mission as a branding tool to lure talent from Big Tech. But many insiders at OpenAI insist it’s central to why they joined the company in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For now, Sora’s footprint is small; the app is one day old. But its debut marks a significant expansion of OpenAI’s consumer business and exposes the company to incentives that have plagued social media apps for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike ChatGPT, which is optimized for usefulness, OpenAI says Sora is built for fun — a place to generate and share AI clips. The feed feels closer to TikTok or Instagram Reels, platforms that are infamous for their addictive loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI insists it wants to avoid those pitfalls, claiming in a blog post announcing the Sora launch that “concerns about doomscrolling, addiction, isolation, and RL-sloptimized feeds are top of mind.” The company explicitly says it’s not optimizing for time spent on feed and instead wants to maximize creation. OpenAI says it will send reminders to users when they’ve been scrolling for too long, and primarily show them people they know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s a stronger starting point than Meta’s Vibes — another AI-powered short-form video feed released last week — which seems to have been raced out without as many safeguards. As a former OpenAI policy leader, Miles Brundage points out that it’s possible there will be good and bad applications of AI-video feeds, much like we’ve seen in the chatbot era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, as Altman has long acknowledged, no one sets out to build an addictive app. The incentives of running a feed guide them to it. OpenAI has even run into problems around sycophancy in ChatGPT, which the company says was unintentional due to some of its training techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a June podcast, Altman discussed what he calls “the big misalignment of social media.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“One of the big mistakes of the social media era was [that] the feed algorithms had a bunch of unintended, negative consequences on society as a whole, and maybe even individual users. Although they were doing the thing that a user wanted — or someone thought users wanted — in the moment, which is [to] get them to, like, keep spending time on the site.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s too soon to tell how aligned the Sora app is with its users or OpenAI’s mission. Users are already noticing some engagement-optimizing techniques in the app, such as the dynamic emojis that appear every time you like a video. That feels designed to shoot a little dopamine to users for engaging with a video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The real test will be how OpenAI evolves Sora. Given how much AI has taken over regular social media feeds, it seems plausible that AI-native feeds could soon have their moment. Whether OpenAI can grow Sora without replicating the mistakes of its predecessors remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2170386424.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Several current and former OpenAI researchers are speaking out over the company’s first foray into social media: the Sora app, a TikTok-style feed filled with AI-generated videos and a lot of Sam Altman deepfakes.
