Patil started at the company earlier this week, taking over from co-founder Sam McCandlish, who will move to a new role as chief architect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the change, Anthropic is updating the structure of its core technical group, bringing the company’s product-engineering team into closer contact with the infrastructure and inference teams. As CTO, Patil will oversee compute, infrastructure, inference, and a variety of other engineering tasks. In the chief architect role, McCandlish will work on pre-training and large-scale model training, extending much of his previous work. Both Patil and McCandlish will report to Anthropic president Daniela Amodei.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This new leadership structure comes as Anthropic faces intense infrastructure competition from AI labs at OpenAI and Meta, which have invested billions into computing infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028, and OpenAI has contracted a similar amount through its work with Oracle and the Stargate project. The scale of Anthropic’s own infrastructure spending is less clear, but there will be immense pressure to optimize the growing infrastructure for both speed and power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, the popularity of Anthropic’s Claude products has already put the company’s infrastructure under significant strain. In July, the company introduced new rate limits to Claude Code, with an eye toward power users who had been running the app “continuously in the background, 24/7.” Under the new rules, users are limited to between 240 and 480 hours of Sonnet usage each week, and between 24 and 40 hours of Opus 4 usage, depending on infrastructure strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With more than 20 years in different engineering roles, Patil brings significant infrastructure experience to Anthropic. He previously spent five years in technical roles at Stripe and served as a senior VP for cloud infrastructure at Oracle. He has also held engineering roles at Amazon and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement, Amodei emphasized Patil’s experience building stable infrastructure for enterprises. “Rahul brings a proven track record in building and scaling the kind of dependable infrastructure that businesses need,” the statement reads. “I couldn’t be more excited about what this means for strengthening Claude’s position as the leading intelligence platform for enterprises.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a paired statement, Patil applauded Anthropic’s research and commitment to AI safety. “I’m thrilled to join Anthropic at this pivotal moment in AI development,” Patil said, adding that his work at the company “feels like the most important work I could be doing right now — I personally can’t think of a greater calling and responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The new TX-Generative AI Next (TX-GAIN) computing system at the&amp;nbsp;Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center  (LLSC) is the most powerful AI supercomputer at any U.S. university. With its recent ranking from  TOP500, which biannually publishes a list of the top supercomputers in various categories, TX-GAIN joins the ranks of other powerful systems at the LLSC, all supporting research and development at Lincoln Laboratory and across the MIT campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TX-GAIN will enable our researchers to achieve scientific and engineering breakthroughs. The system will play a large role in supporting generative AI, physical simulation, and data analysis across all research areas," says Lincoln Laboratory Fellow&amp;nbsp;Jeremy Kepner, who heads the LLSC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC is a key resource for accelerating innovation at Lincoln Laboratory. Thousands of researchers tap into the LLSC to analyze data, train models, and run simulations for federally funded research projects. The supercomputers have been used, for example,&amp;nbsp;to simulate billions of aircraft encounters to develop collision-avoidance systems for the Federal Aviation Administration, and to train models in the complex tasks of autonomous navigation for the Department of Defense. Over the years, LLSC capabilities have been essential to numerous&amp;nbsp;award-winning technologies, including those that have improved  airline safety,  prevented the spread of new diseases, and  aided in hurricane responses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, TX-GAIN is especially equipped for developing and applying generative AI. Whereas traditional AI focuses on categorization tasks, like identifying whether a photo depicts a dog or cat, generative AI produces entirely new outputs. Kepner describes it as a mathematical combination of interpolation (filling in the gaps between known data points) and extrapolation (extending data beyond known points). Today, generative AI is widely known for its use of large language models to create human-like responses to user prompts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Lincoln Laboratory, teams are applying generative AI to various domains beyond large language models. They are using the technology, for instance, to evaluate radar signatures, supplement weather data where coverage is missing, root out anomalies in network traffic, and explore chemical interactions to design new medicines and materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable such intense computations, TX-GAIN is powered by more than 600 NVIDIA graphics processing unit accelerators specially designed for AI operations, in addition to traditional high-performance computing hardware. With a peak performance of two AI exaflops (two quintillion floating-point operations per second), TX-GAIN is the top AI system at a university, and in the Northeast.&amp;nbsp;Since TX-GAIN came online this summer, researchers have taken notice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TX-GAIN is allowing us to model not only significantly more protein interactions than ever before, but also much larger proteins with more atoms. This new computational capability is a game-changer for protein characterization efforts in biological defense," says Rafael Jaimes, a researcher in Lincoln Laboratory's&amp;nbsp;Counter–Weapons of Mass Destruction Systems Group.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC's focus on&amp;nbsp;interactive supercomputing makes it especially useful to researchers. For years, the LLSC has pioneered software that lets users access its powerful systems without needing to be experts in configuring algorithms for parallel processing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The LLSC has always tried to make supercomputing feel like working on your laptop," Kepner says. "The amount of data and the sophistication of analysis methods needed to be competitive today are well beyond what can be done on a laptop. But with our user-friendly approach, people can run their model and get answers quickly from their workspace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond supporting programs solely at Lincoln Laboratory, TX-GAIN is enhancing research collaborations with MIT's campus. Such collaborations include the&amp;nbsp;Haystack Observatory,&amp;nbsp;Center for Quantum Engineering,&amp;nbsp;Beaver Works, and&amp;nbsp;Department of Air Force–MIT AI Accelerator. The latter initiative is rapidly prototyping, scaling, and applying AI technologies for the U.S. Air Force and Space Force,&amp;nbsp;optimizing flight scheduling for global operations as one fielded example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC systems are housed in an energy-efficient data center and facility in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Research staff in the LLSC are also tackling the immense&amp;nbsp;energy needs of AI and leading research into various&amp;nbsp;power-reduction methods. One software tool they developed can reduce the energy of training an AI model by&amp;nbsp;as much as 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The LLSC provides the capabilities needed to do leading-edge research, while in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner," Kepner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the supercomputers at the LLSC use the "TX" nomenclature in homage&amp;nbsp;to Lincoln Laboratory's Transistorized Experimental Computer Zero (TX-0) of 1956. TX-0 was one of the world's first transistor-based machines, and its 1958 successor,&amp;nbsp;TX-2, is storied for its role in pioneering human-computer interaction and AI. With TX-GAIN,&amp;nbsp;the LLSC continues this legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship announced that Ana Bakshi has been named its new executive director. Bakshi stepped into the role at the start of the fall semester and will collaborate closely with the managing director, Ethernet Inventors Professor of the Practice Bill Aulet, to elevate the center to higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ana is uniquely qualified for this role. She brings a deep and highly decorated background in entrepreneurship education at the highest levels, along with exceptional leadership and execution skills,” says Aulet. “Since I first met her 12 years ago, I have been extraordinarily impressed with her commitment to create the highest-quality centers and institutes for entrepreneurs, first at King’s College London and then at Oxford University. This ideal skill set is compounded by her experience in leading high-growth companies, most recently as the chief operation officer in an award-winning AI startup. I’m honored and thrilled to welcome her to MIT — her knowledge and energy will greatly elevate our community, and the field as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rapidly changing environment creates imperative for raising the bar for entrepreneurship education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to raise the bar for innovation-driven entrepreneurship education is both timely and urgent. The rate of change is getting faster and faster every day, especially with artificial intelligence, and is generating new problems that need to be solved, as well as exacerbating existing problems in climate, health care, manufacturing, future of work, education, and economic stratification, to name but a few. The world needs more entrepreneurs and better entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi joins the Trust Center at an exciting time in its history. MIT is at the forefront of helping to develop people and systems that can turn challenges into opportunities using an entrepreneurial mindset, skill set, and way of operating.&amp;nbsp;Bakshi’s deep experience and success will be key to unlocking this opportunity. “I am truly honored to join the Trust Center at such a pivotal moment,” Bakshi says. “In an era defined by both extraordinary challenges and extraordinary possibilities, the future will be built by those bold enough to try, and MIT will be at the forefront of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translating academic research into real-world impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi has a decade of experience building two world-class entrepreneurship centers from the ground up. She served as the founding director at King’s College and then at Oxford. In this role, she was responsible for all aspects of these centers, including fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While at Oxford, she authored a data-driven approach to determining efficacy of outcomes for their programs, as evidenced by a 61-page study, “Universities: Drivers of Prosperity and Economic Recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the director of the Oxford Foundry (Oxford’s cross-university entrepreneurship center), Bakshi focused on investing in ambitious founders and talent. The center was backed by global entrepreneurial leaders such as the founders of LinkedIn and Twitter, with corporate partnerships including Santander and EY, and investment funds including Oxford Science Enterprises (OSE). As of 2021, the startups supported by the Foundry and King’s College have raised over $500 million and have created nearly 3,000 jobs, spanning diverse industries including health tech, climate tech, cybersecurity, fintech, and deep tech spinouts focusing on world-class science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, she built the highly successful and economically sustainable&amp;nbsp;Entrepreneurship School, Oxford’s first digital online learning platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi comes to MIT after having worked in the private sector as the chief operating officer (COO) in a rapidly growing artificial intelligence startup for almost two years,&amp;nbsp;Quench.ai, with offices in London and New York City. She was the first C-suite employee at Quench.ai, serving as COO and now senior advisor, helping companies unlock value from their knowledge through AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right place, right time, right person moving at the speed of MIT AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, then turbocharged in the 1940s with the creation and operation of the&amp;nbsp;RadLab, and continuing to this day, entrepreneurship is at the core of MIT’s identity and mission.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MIT has been a leader in entrepreneurship for decades. It’s now the third leg of the school, alongside teaching and research,” says Mark Gorenberg ’76, chair of the MIT Corporation. “I’m excited to have such a transformative leader as Ana join the Trust Center team, and I look forward to the impact she will have on the students and the wider academic community at MIT as we enter an exciting new phase in company building, driven by the accelerated use of AI and emerging technologies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a time where we are rethinking management education, entrepreneurship as an interdisciplinary field to create impact is even more important to our future. To have such an experienced and accomplished leader in academia and the startup world, especially in AI, reinforces our commitment to be a global leader in this field,” says Richard M. Locke, John C Head III Dean at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT is a unique hub of research, innovation, and entrepreneurship, and that special mix creates massive positive impact that ripples around the world,” says Frederic Kerrest, MIT Sloan MBA ’09, co-founder of Okta, and member of the MIT Corporation. “In a rapidly changing, AI-driven world, Ana has the skills and experience to further accelerate MIT’s global leadership in entrepreneurship education to ensure that our students launch and scale the next generation of groundbreaking, innovation-driven startups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to her time at Oxford and King’s College, Bakshi served as an elected councilor representing 6,000-plus constituents, held roles in international nongovernmental organizations, and led product execution strategy at MAHI, an award-winning family-led craft sauce startup, available in thousands of major retailers across the U.K.&amp;nbsp;Bakshi sits on the&amp;nbsp;advisory council for conservation charity&amp;nbsp;Save the Elephants, leveraging AI-driven and scientific approaches to reduce human-wildlife conflict and protect elephant populations.&amp;nbsp;Her work and impact have been featured across &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, BBC, &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;. Bakshi was twice honored as a Top 50 Woman in Tech (U.K.), most recently in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As AI changes how we learn, how we build, and how we scale, my focus will be on helping MIT expand its support for phenomenal talent — students and faculty — with the skills, ecosystem, and backing to turn knowledge into impact,” Bakshi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35 years of impact to date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center was founded in 1990 by the late Professor Edward Roberts and serves all MIT students across all schools and all disciplines.&amp;nbsp;It supports 60-plus courses and extensive extracurricular programming, including the delta v academic accelerator. Much of the work of the center is generated through the Disciplined Entrepreneurship methodology, which offers a proven approach to create new ventures. Over a thousand schools and other organizations across the world use Disciplined Entrepreneurship books and resources to teach entrepreneurship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with AI-powered tools like&amp;nbsp;Orbit and&amp;nbsp;JetPack, the Trust Center is changing the way that entrepreneurship is taught and practiced. Its mission is to produce the next generation of innovation-driven entrepreneurs while advancing the field more broadly to make it both rigorous and practical. This approach of leveraging proven evidence-based methodology, emerging technology, the ingenuity of MIT students, and responding to industry shifts is similar to how MIT&amp;nbsp;established the field of chemical engineering in the 1890s. The desired result in both cases was to create a comprehensive, integrated, scalable, rigorous, and practical curriculum to create a new workforce to address the nation’s and world’s greatest challenges.&lt;/p&gt;        

      &lt;/div&gt;

Bakshi stepped into the role at the start of the fall semester and will collaborate closely with the managing director, Ethernet Inventors Professor of the Practice Bill Aulet, to elevate the center to higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ana is uniquely qualified for this role. She brings a deep and highly decorated background in entrepreneurship education at the highest levels, along with exceptional leadership and execution skills,” says Aulet. “Since I first met her 12 years ago, I have been extraordinarily impressed with her commitment to create the highest-quality centers and institutes for entrepreneurs, first at King’s College London and then at Oxford University. This ideal skill set is compounded by her experience in leading high-growth companies, most recently as the chief operation officer in an award-winning AI startup. I’m honored and thrilled to welcome her to MIT — her knowledge and energy will greatly elevate our community, and the field as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rapidly changing environment creates imperative for raising the bar for entrepreneurship education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to raise the bar for innovation-driven entrepreneurship education is both timely and urgent. The rate of change is getting faster and faster every day, especially with artificial intelligence, and is generating new problems that need to be solved, as well as exacerbating existing problems in climate, health care, manufacturing, future of work, education, and economic stratification, to name but a few. The world needs more entrepreneurs and better entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi joins the Trust Center at an exciting time in its history. MIT is at the forefront of helping to develop people and systems that can turn challenges into opportunities using an entrepreneurial mindset, skill set, and way of operating.&amp;nbsp;Bakshi’s deep experience and success will be key to unlocking this opportunity. “I am truly honored to join the Trust Center at such a pivotal moment,” Bakshi says. “In an era defined by both extraordinary challenges and extraordinary possibilities, the future will be built by those bold enough to try, and MIT will be at the forefront of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translating academic research into real-world impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi has a decade of experience building two world-class entrepreneurship centers from the ground up. She served as the founding director at King’s College and then at Oxford. In this role, she was responsible for all aspects of these centers, including fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While at Oxford, she authored a data-driven approach to determining efficacy of outcomes for their programs, as evidenced by a 61-page study, “Universities: Drivers of Prosperity and Economic Recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the director of the Oxford Foundry (Oxford’s cross-university entrepreneurship center), Bakshi focused on investing in ambitious founders and talent. The center was backed by global entrepreneurial leaders such as the founders of LinkedIn and Twitter, with corporate partnerships including Santander and EY, and investment funds including Oxford Science Enterprises (OSE). As of 2021, the startups supported by the Foundry and King’s College have raised over $500 million and have created nearly 3,000 jobs, spanning diverse industries including health tech, climate tech, cybersecurity, fintech, and deep tech spinouts focusing on world-class science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, she built the highly successful and economically sustainable&amp;nbsp;Entrepreneurship School, Oxford’s first digital online learning platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi comes to MIT after having worked in the private sector as the chief operating officer (COO) in a rapidly growing artificial intelligence startup for almost two years,&amp;nbsp;Quench.ai, with offices in London and New York City. She was the first C-suite employee at Quench.ai, serving as COO and now senior advisor, helping companies unlock value from their knowledge through AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right place, right time, right person moving at the speed of MIT AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, then turbocharged in the 1940s with the creation and operation of the&amp;nbsp;RadLab, and continuing to this day, entrepreneurship is at the core of MIT’s identity and mission.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MIT has been a leader in entrepreneurship for decades. It’s now the third leg of the school, alongside teaching and research,” says Mark Gorenberg ’76, chair of the MIT Corporation. “I’m excited to have such a transformative leader as Ana join the Trust Center team, and I look forward to the impact she will have on the students and the wider academic community at MIT as we enter an exciting new phase in company building, driven by the accelerated use of AI and emerging technologies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a time where we are rethinking management education, entrepreneurship as an interdisciplinary field to create impact is even more important to our future. To have such an experienced and accomplished leader in academia and the startup world, especially in AI, reinforces our commitment to be a global leader in this field,” says Richard M. Locke, John C Head III Dean at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT is a unique hub of research, innovation, and entrepreneurship, and that special mix creates massive positive impact that ripples around the world,” says Frederic Kerrest, MIT Sloan MBA ’09, co-founder of Okta, and member of the MIT Corporation. “In a rapidly changing, AI-driven world, Ana has the skills and experience to further accelerate MIT’s global leadership in entrepreneurship education to ensure that our students launch and scale the next generation of groundbreaking, innovation-driven startups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to her time at Oxford and King’s College, Bakshi served as an elected councilor representing 6,000-plus constituents, held roles in international nongovernmental organizations, and led product execution strategy at MAHI, an award-winning family-led craft sauce startup, available in thousands of major retailers across the U.K.&amp;nbsp;Bakshi sits on the&amp;nbsp;advisory council for conservation charity&amp;nbsp;Save the Elephants, leveraging AI-driven and scientific approaches to reduce human-wildlife conflict and protect elephant populations.&amp;nbsp;Her work and impact have been featured across &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, BBC, &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;. Bakshi was twice honored as a Top 50 Woman in Tech (U.K.), most recently in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As AI changes how we learn, how we build, and how we scale, my focus will be on helping MIT expand its support for phenomenal talent — students and faculty — with the skills, ecosystem, and backing to turn knowledge into impact,” Bakshi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35 years of impact to date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center was founded in 1990 by the late Professor Edward Roberts and serves all MIT students across all schools and all disciplines.&amp;nbsp;It supports 60-plus courses and extensive extracurricular programming, including the delta v academic accelerator. Much of the work of the center is generated through the Disciplined Entrepreneurship methodology, which offers a proven approach to create new ventures. Over a thousand schools and other organizations across the world use Disciplined Entrepreneurship books and resources to teach entrepreneurship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with AI-powered tools like&amp;nbsp;Orbit and&amp;nbsp;JetPack, the Trust Center is changing the way that entrepreneurship is taught and practiced. Its mission is to produce the next generation of innovation-driven entrepreneurs while advancing the field more broadly to make it both rigorous and practical. This approach of leveraging proven evidence-based methodology, emerging technology, the ingenuity of MIT students, and responding to industry shifts is similar to how MIT&amp;nbsp;established the field of chemical engineering in the 1890s. The desired result in both cases was to create a comprehensive, integrated, scalable, rigorous, and practical curriculum to create a new workforce to address the nation’s and world’s greatest challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a robotics pioneer who has spent decades building humanoid machines recommends that you stand at least nine feet away from any full-sized walking robot, you should probably listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My advice to people is to not come closer than 3 meters to a full-size walking robot," Rodney Brooks writes in a technical essay titled "Why Today’s Humanoids Won’t Learn Dexterity" published on his blog last week. "Until someone comes up with a better version of a two-legged&amp;nbsp;walking robot that is much safer to be near, and even in contact with, we will not see humanoid robots get certified to be deployed in zones that also have people in them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooks, the MIT professor emeritus who co-founded iRobot (of Roomba fame) and Rethink Robotics, believes companies pouring billions into humanoid development are chasing an expensive fantasy. Among other problems yet to be addressed, he warns that today's bipedal humanoids are fundamentally unsafe for humans to be near when they walk due to the massive kinetic energy they generate while maintaining balance. That stored-up energy can cause severe injury if the robot falls or its limbs strike someone.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on the dangers of robots in a minute. Beyond concerns about malfunction, Brooks contests the prevailing belief that humanoid robots will soon replace human workers by learning dexterity through watching videos of people performing tasks. It's a common robotics AI training technique we have covered in the past. He does not think such robots are impossible, but that they may be further off than most people think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some corners of the tech world, robot hype has reached a fever pitch due to the rapid gains in AI. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has claimed that the company's Optimus robots could generate $30 trillion in revenue, while Figure's CEO Brett Adcock envisions humanoids serving millions of tasks in the labor force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, hardware is much harder than software. Unlike software that runs in a virtual world, the laws of physics are unforgiving and immutable, and interacting with the physical world safely requires a great deal of sensory input. Brooks, who has been working on robot manipulation since the 1970s, argues these companies are missing the fundamental ingredient for dexterous manipulation: the sense of touch.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The crux of Brooks' argument centers on how companies like Tesla and Figure are training their robots. Both have publicly stated they are using a vision-only approach, having workers wear camera rigs to record tasks like folding shirts or picking up objects. The data is then fed into AI models, which can imitate permutations of the motions in novel contexts. Tesla recently shifted away from motion capture suits and teleoperation for data collection to a video-based method, with workers wearing helmets and backpacks equipped with five cameras. Figure's "Project Go-Big" initiative similarly relies on transferring knowledge directly from what they call "everyday human video."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In addition to video capture from real humans performing tasks, some robotics AI models use simulations of physical space for training, which have similar limitations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These approaches, Brooks argues, ignore decades of research showing that human dexterity depends on an extraordinarily complex touch-sensing system. He cites work from Roland Johansson's lab at Umeå University showing that when a person's fingertips are anesthetized, a seven-second task of picking up and lighting a match stretches to nearly 30 seconds of fumbling. The human hand contains about 17,000 mechanoreceptors, with 1,000 concentrated in each fingertip alone. Recent research from David Ginty's lab at Harvard has identified 15 families of neurons involved in touch sensing, detecting everything from gentle indentation to vibrations to skin stretching. That's a lot of sensory information that current robot systems cannot yet capture or simulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The physics of falling robots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the dexterity problem lies an even more immediate safety concern. Current humanoid robots use powerful electric motors and a decades-old algorithm called zero moment point to maintain balance by pumping large amounts of energy into their systems when instability is detected. This approach works well enough to keep them upright most of the time, but it creates what Brooks describes as a fundamental incompatibility with human proximity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scaling laws of physics make full-sized humanoids exponentially more dangerous than their smaller counterparts. When you double the size of a robot, Brooks says, its mass increases by a factor of eight. That means a falling full-sized humanoid has eight times the kinetic energy of a half-sized version. If that rapidly accelerating metal leg encounters anything in its path during a fall, the impact can cause severe injury.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;In his post, Brooks recounts being "way too close" to an Agility Robotics Digit humanoid when it fell several years ago. He has not dared approach one while walking since. Even in promotional videos from humanoid companies, Brooks notes, humans are never shown close to moving humanoid robots unless separated by furniture, and even then, the robots only shuffle minimally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This safety problem extends beyond accidental falls. For humanoids to fulfill their promised role in health care and factory settings, they need certification to operate in zones shared with humans. Current walking mechanisms make such certification virtually impossible under existing safety standards in most parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brooks predicts that within 15 years, there will indeed be many robots called "humanoids" performing various tasks. But ironically, they will look nothing like today's bipedal machines. They will have wheels instead of feet, varying numbers of arms, and specialized sensors that bear no resemblance to human eyes. Some will have cameras in their hands or looking down from their midsections. The definition of "humanoid" will shift, just as "flying cars" now means electric helicopters rather than road-capable aircraft, and "self-driving cars" means vehicles with remote human monitors rather than truly autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billions currently being invested in forcing today's rigid, vision-only humanoids to learn dexterity will largely disappear, Brooks argues. Academic researchers are making more progress with systems that incorporate touch feedback, like MIT's approach using a glove that transmits sensations between human operators and robot hands. But even these advances remain far from the comprehensive touch sensing that enables human dexterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, few people spend their days near humanoid robots, but Brooks's three-meter rule stands as a practical warning of challenges ahead from someone who has spent decades building these machines. The gap between promotional videos and deployable reality remains large, measured not just in years but in fundamental unsolved problems of physics, sensing, and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a robotics pioneer who has spent decades building humanoid machines recommends that you stand at least nine feet away from any full-sized walking robot, you should probably listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My advice to people is to not come closer than 3 meters to a full-size walking robot," Rodney Brooks writes in a technical essay titled "Why Today’s Humanoids Won’t Learn Dexterity" published on his blog last week. "Until someone comes up with a better version of a two-legged&amp;nbsp;walking robot that is much safer to be near, and even in contact with, we will not see humanoid robots get certified to be deployed in zones that also have people in them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooks, the MIT professor emeritus who co-founded iRobot (of Roomba fame) and Rethink Robotics, believes companies pouring billions into humanoid development are chasing an expensive fantasy. Among other problems yet to be addressed, he warns that today's bipedal humanoids are fundamentally unsafe for humans to be near when they walk due to the massive kinetic energy they generate while maintaining balance. That stored-up energy can cause severe injury if the robot falls or its limbs strike someone.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on the dangers of robots in a minute. Beyond concerns about malfunction, Brooks contests the prevailing belief that humanoid robots will soon replace human workers by learning dexterity through watching videos of people performing tasks. It's a common robotics AI training technique we have covered in the past. He does not think such robots are impossible, but that they may be further off than most people think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some corners of the tech world, robot hype has reached a fever pitch due to the rapid gains in AI. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has claimed that the company's Optimus robots could generate $30 trillion in revenue, while Figure's CEO Brett Adcock envisions humanoids serving millions of tasks in the labor force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, hardware is much harder than software. Unlike software that runs in a virtual world, the laws of physics are unforgiving and immutable, and interacting with the physical world safely requires a great deal of sensory input. Brooks, who has been working on robot manipulation since the 1970s, argues these companies are missing the fundamental ingredient for dexterous manipulation: the sense of touch.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The crux of Brooks' argument centers on how companies like Tesla and Figure are training their robots. Both have publicly stated they are using a vision-only approach, having workers wear camera rigs to record tasks like folding shirts or picking up objects. The data is then fed into AI models, which can imitate permutations of the motions in novel contexts. Tesla recently shifted away from motion capture suits and teleoperation for data collection to a video-based method, with workers wearing helmets and backpacks equipped with five cameras. Figure's "Project Go-Big" initiative similarly relies on transferring knowledge directly from what they call "everyday human video."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In addition to video capture from real humans performing tasks, some robotics AI models use simulations of physical space for training, which have similar limitations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These approaches, Brooks argues, ignore decades of research showing that human dexterity depends on an extraordinarily complex touch-sensing system. He cites work from Roland Johansson's lab at Umeå University showing that when a person's fingertips are anesthetized, a seven-second task of picking up and lighting a match stretches to nearly 30 seconds of fumbling. The human hand contains about 17,000 mechanoreceptors, with 1,000 concentrated in each fingertip alone. Recent research from David Ginty's lab at Harvard has identified 15 families of neurons involved in touch sensing, detecting everything from gentle indentation to vibrations to skin stretching. That's a lot of sensory information that current robot systems cannot yet capture or simulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The physics of falling robots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the dexterity problem lies an even more immediate safety concern. Current humanoid robots use powerful electric motors and a decades-old algorithm called zero moment point to maintain balance by pumping large amounts of energy into their systems when instability is detected. This approach works well enough to keep them upright most of the time, but it creates what Brooks describes as a fundamental incompatibility with human proximity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scaling laws of physics make full-sized humanoids exponentially more dangerous than their smaller counterparts. When you double the size of a robot, Brooks says, its mass increases by a factor of eight. That means a falling full-sized humanoid has eight times the kinetic energy of a half-sized version. If that rapidly accelerating metal leg encounters anything in its path during a fall, the impact can cause severe injury.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;In his post, Brooks recounts being "way too close" to an Agility Robotics Digit humanoid when it fell several years ago. He has not dared approach one while walking since. Even in promotional videos from humanoid companies, Brooks notes, humans are never shown close to moving humanoid robots unless separated by furniture, and even then, the robots only shuffle minimally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This safety problem extends beyond accidental falls. For humanoids to fulfill their promised role in health care and factory settings, they need certification to operate in zones shared with humans. Current walking mechanisms make such certification virtually impossible under existing safety standards in most parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brooks predicts that within 15 years, there will indeed be many robots called "humanoids" performing various tasks. But ironically, they will look nothing like today's bipedal machines. They will have wheels instead of feet, varying numbers of arms, and specialized sensors that bear no resemblance to human eyes. Some will have cameras in their hands or looking down from their midsections. The definition of "humanoid" will shift, just as "flying cars" now means electric helicopters rather than road-capable aircraft, and "self-driving cars" means vehicles with remote human monitors rather than truly autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billions currently being invested in forcing today's rigid, vision-only humanoids to learn dexterity will largely disappear, Brooks argues. Academic researchers are making more progress with systems that incorporate touch feedback, like MIT's approach using a glove that transmits sensations between human operators and robot hands. But even these advances remain far from the comprehensive touch sensing that enables human dexterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, few people spend their days near humanoid robots, but Brooks's three-meter rule stands as a practical warning of challenges ahead from someone who has spent decades building these machines. The gap between promotional videos and deployable reality remains large, measured not just in years but in fundamental unsolved problems of physics, sensing, and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

Can it keep it? (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/after-nine-years-of-grinding-replit-finally-found-its-market-can-it-keep-it/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-9.34.51PM.png?resize=1200,668" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;While AI coding startups like Cursor close brow-raising rounds on barely three years of existence, Replit’s path to a $3 billion valuation has been anything but swift. For CEO Amjad Masad, who’s been building tools to democratize programming since 2009, it’s a story of muscling through multiple failed business models, years stuck at the same revenue plateau, and a reckoning last year that forced him to cut half his staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That makes what happened next more remarkable. Earlier this month, the Bay Area-based company closed a $250 million funding round led by Prysm Capital, nearly tripling its valuation from 2023. The raise came on the heels of never-before-seen revenue growth for the company — from just $2.8 million last year to $150 million in annualized revenue in less than a year. But for Masad, this moment represents something more than finally realizing financial traction. It’s the culmination of a 16-year obsession.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our mission has always been the same,” Masad told me on the newest episode of TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC Download podcast. “Initially, we said we want to make programming more accessible, and then we sort of upped the ante a little bit. We said we’re going to create a billion programmers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s purposely audacious – what a headline! – but it’s also something that Masad, a Palestinian-Jordanian, has been working toward for his entire career. As he tells it, he came to the United States in 2012 after his open-source coding project began gaining attention – including catching the eye of the New York Times. But he’d been making programming more accessible since building his first online coding experience back in 2009, with his work as an early engineer at the startup Codecademy kicking off what became the massively online open courses (MOOC) revolution. (His code also powered the in-browser tutorials of Udacity, a Codecademy rival that launched in 2012, one year after Codecademy was founded.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, turning that vision into a viable business of his own proved a lot harder than he anticipated. Replit was founded in 2016, and for eight long years, the company struggled to find product-market fit. “We had reached that $2.83 million [in annual recurring revenue] back in ’21, maybe,” Masad recalled. “And so this is how painful it’s been. We’ve been hovering around the same revenue for like four or five years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company tried selling to schools (“incredibly difficult,” Masad noted), cycling through different business models, and watched each one stabilize around the same modest revenue level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Along the way, Replit built sophisticated infrastructure for cloud development environments and “multiplayer coding,” collaborative editing akin to Google Docs but for programming. But the technical achievement wasn’t translating into revenue growth, and by last year, with the company at 130 employees and burning through cash, Masad said he had to make a painful decision. “I looked at our burn, and I looked at our progress on our revenue chart, and it just didn’t make any sense. The business wasn’t viable.” Replit cut its headcount by 50%, bringing it down to around 60 to 70 people at its lowest point.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then came the breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last fall, Replit launched Replit Agent, which Masad calls “the first agent-based coding experience in the world” that can’t just write code but “debug it, deploy, provision the database for you, just act as a true software engineering partner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Soon after, in January of this year, he announced that Replit was abandoning professional developers as its core market.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Hacker News was really unhappy,” Masad acknowledged when we talked. But he also hasn’t looked back, completely moving away from competing in the crowded market of tools for professional developers – where companies like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others are battling it out – to instead focus on creating a billion software developers from white-collar employees with no technical background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The idea of making programming more accessible to the average individual, to the knowledge worker, really, that’s where we think our market is,” Masad explains. “It’s a fundamentally new market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Right now, that bet looks very smart. Numerous reports this summer said that revenue at Replit had grown to over $150 million in annualized revenue and Masad hinted that it’s now even higher. He also said that unlike many AI-powered coding companies, Replit is gross margin positive. On enterprise deals, which make up an increasing share of revenue, margins are “80% to 90%,” according to Masad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s hard to verify such a claim, but Replit’s market position received some validation this week when Andreessen Horowitz released its first AI Spending Report in partnership with fintech firm Mercury. Analyzing transaction data from Mercury, the report tracked the top 50 AI-native application layer companies that startups are actually spending money on. While major labs OpenAI and Anthropic took the top two spots, Replit landed at No. 3, outranking every other development tool. (Worth noting: Andreessen Horowitz has invested in multiple rounds of funding for Replit.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Profitability is rare in AI coding because many competitors face what Masad calls “the negative gross margin trap.” The reality is that serving professional developers with AI assistance can be compute-intensive. Counterintuitively, Replit’s focus on non-technical users – who might seem like they’d require more AI assistance – works in their favor on the business model front for enterprise customers like Zillow, Duolingo, and Coinbase, which pay $100 per seat, plus usage-based pricing built on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This new path hasn’t been without some faceplants. In July, venture capitalist Jason Lemkin went viral after the newest version of Replit’s AI agent deleted his production database with 100-plus executive contacts, fabricating 4,000 fake records afterward and later admitting to Lemkin that it “panicked.” (There is a failure mode in AI agents called reward hacking, where models become so obsessed with achieving a certain goal that they effectively cheat when they miss the mark.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rather than becoming defensive, Masad and his team owned the problem. In fact, says Masad, within two days, they rolled out an automatic safety system that separates a user’s “practice” database from their “real” one. The way Masad describes it, it’s a little like having two versions of a website’s filing cabinet — the AI agent can experiment freely in a development database, but the production database, which is the real thing that users interact with, is completely walled off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Masad told me the incident ultimately put the company on stronger footing, given the problems around safety and security it needed to figure out — and fast. “If you solve hard problems, then you have a technology moat,” he said. (Lemkin, for his part, says he has become a super user of Replit despite having no technical background just months ago.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, even now, Replit isn’t out of the woods. If anything, its success has painted a target on its back. To wit, the company — which now employs 110 people — still faces an existential threat from the very AI labs whose models power its platform: Anthropic and OpenAI. Both companies have launched their own coding tools that compete directly with companies like Replit and Cursor, and these foundation model companies can afford to subsidize their coding tools and post-train their models on their own products, optimizing performance in ways that third-party platforms might always struggle to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Replit’s advantage, according to Masad, lies in targeting non-technical users rather than professional developers, plus the sophisticated infrastructure around deployment and database management that it has built and which foundation model companies still don’t prioritize (for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, Replit has another unusual advantage for a startup: a $350 million war chest. Despite raising $100 million in 2023, the company “hadn’t touched” those funds by the time it raised this latest round, Masad told me. The company is capital efficient by design, though Masad joked that as an entrepreneur who grew up watching his refugee father struggle, “one thing I need to learn is to be less frugal and start spending money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whether that edge keeps Replit ahead of competitors is an open question, and it’s one about which Masad is mindful. Right now, the plan is to scale operations, accelerate product development, and pursue acquisitions — both acqui-hires and potentially companies working on agent automation in specific verticals. But for Masad, who appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast in July and has seen his company’s fortunes transform, the moment is bittersweet. When asked how it feels to be receiving so much attention – not to mention that $3 billion valuation – he invoked the adage that “this too shall pass. This might mean that when you’re in a bad situation, that’ll pass, but we’re also in a good situation that will pass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a stoic response from someone who spent the better part of a decade working away at the same revenue level, convinced that AI agents would eventually transform programming but unable to prove it to the market. But one major difference between Replit and the wave of AI coding startups now flooding the market is that Masad has lived through multiple hype cycles and has he emerged with something relatively differentiated – and reportedly profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’ve learned to be a little stoic,” he said. “What matters is for us to do the right thing, be principled, and move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-9.34.51PM.png?resize=1200,668" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;While AI coding startups like Cursor close brow-raising rounds on barely three years of existence, Replit’s path to a $3 billion valuation has been anything but swift. For CEO Amjad Masad, who’s been building tools to democratize programming since 2009, it’s a story of muscling through multiple failed business models, years stuck at the same revenue plateau, and a reckoning last year that forced him to cut half his staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That makes what happened next more remarkable. Earlier this month, the Bay Area-based company closed a $250 million funding round led by Prysm Capital, nearly tripling its valuation from 2023. The raise came on the heels of never-before-seen revenue growth for the company — from just $2.8 million last year to $150 million in annualized revenue in less than a year. But for Masad, this moment represents something more than finally realizing financial traction. It’s the culmination of a 16-year obsession.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our mission has always been the same,” Masad told me on the newest episode of TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC Download podcast. “Initially, we said we want to make programming more accessible, and then we sort of upped the ante a little bit. We said we’re going to create a billion programmers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s purposely audacious – what a headline! – but it’s also something that Masad, a Palestinian-Jordanian, has been working toward for his entire career. As he tells it, he came to the United States in 2012 after his open-source coding project began gaining attention – including catching the eye of the New York Times. But he’d been making programming more accessible since building his first online coding experience back in 2009, with his work as an early engineer at the startup Codecademy kicking off what became the massively online open courses (MOOC) revolution. (His code also powered the in-browser tutorials of Udacity, a Codecademy rival that launched in 2012, one year after Codecademy was founded.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, turning that vision into a viable business of his own proved a lot harder than he anticipated. Replit was founded in 2016, and for eight long years, the company struggled to find product-market fit. “We had reached that $2.83 million [in annual recurring revenue] back in ’21, maybe,” Masad recalled. “And so this is how painful it’s been. We’ve been hovering around the same revenue for like four or five years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company tried selling to schools (“incredibly difficult,” Masad noted), cycling through different business models, and watched each one stabilize around the same modest revenue level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Along the way, Replit built sophisticated infrastructure for cloud development environments and “multiplayer coding,” collaborative editing akin to Google Docs but for programming. But the technical achievement wasn’t translating into revenue growth, and by last year, with the company at 130 employees and burning through cash, Masad said he had to make a painful decision. “I looked at our burn, and I looked at our progress on our revenue chart, and it just didn’t make any sense. The business wasn’t viable.” Replit cut its headcount by 50%, bringing it down to around 60 to 70 people at its lowest point.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then came the breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last fall, Replit launched Replit Agent, which Masad calls “the first agent-based coding experience in the world” that can’t just write code but “debug it, deploy, provision the database for you, just act as a true software engineering partner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Soon after, in January of this year, he announced that Replit was abandoning professional developers as its core market.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Hacker News was really unhappy,” Masad acknowledged when we talked. But he also hasn’t looked back, completely moving away from competing in the crowded market of tools for professional developers – where companies like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others are battling it out – to instead focus on creating a billion software developers from white-collar employees with no technical background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The idea of making programming more accessible to the average individual, to the knowledge worker, really, that’s where we think our market is,” Masad explains. “It’s a fundamentally new market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Right now, that bet looks very smart. Numerous reports this summer said that revenue at Replit had grown to over $150 million in annualized revenue and Masad hinted that it’s now even higher. He also said that unlike many AI-powered coding companies, Replit is gross margin positive. On enterprise deals, which make up an increasing share of revenue, margins are “80% to 90%,” according to Masad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s hard to verify such a claim, but Replit’s market position received some validation this week when Andreessen Horowitz released its first AI Spending Report in partnership with fintech firm Mercury. Analyzing transaction data from Mercury, the report tracked the top 50 AI-native application layer companies that startups are actually spending money on. While major labs OpenAI and Anthropic took the top two spots, Replit landed at No. 3, outranking every other development tool. (Worth noting: Andreessen Horowitz has invested in multiple rounds of funding for Replit.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Profitability is rare in AI coding because many competitors face what Masad calls “the negative gross margin trap.” The reality is that serving professional developers with AI assistance can be compute-intensive. Counterintuitively, Replit’s focus on non-technical users – who might seem like they’d require more AI assistance – works in their favor on the business model front for enterprise customers like Zillow, Duolingo, and Coinbase, which pay $100 per seat, plus usage-based pricing built on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This new path hasn’t been without some faceplants. In July, venture capitalist Jason Lemkin went viral after the newest version of Replit’s AI agent deleted his production database with 100-plus executive contacts, fabricating 4,000 fake records afterward and later admitting to Lemkin that it “panicked.” (There is a failure mode in AI agents called reward hacking, where models become so obsessed with achieving a certain goal that they effectively cheat when they miss the mark.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rather than becoming defensive, Masad and his team owned the problem. In fact, says Masad, within two days, they rolled out an automatic safety system that separates a user’s “practice” database from their “real” one. The way Masad describes it, it’s a little like having two versions of a website’s filing cabinet — the AI agent can experiment freely in a development database, but the production database, which is the real thing that users interact with, is completely walled off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Masad told me the incident ultimately put the company on stronger footing, given the problems around safety and security it needed to figure out — and fast. “If you solve hard problems, then you have a technology moat,” he said. (Lemkin, for his part, says he has become a super user of Replit despite having no technical background just months ago.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, even now, Replit isn’t out of the woods. If anything, its success has painted a target on its back.
