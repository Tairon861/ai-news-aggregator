&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI,” wrote Meta’s chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan in a post on LinkedIn. “We have carefully reviewed the European Commission’s Code of Practice for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models and Meta won’t be signing it. This Code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The EU’s code of practice — a voluntary framework published earlier this month — aims to help companies implement processes and systems to comply with the bloc’s legislation for regulating AI. Among other things, the code requires companies to provide and regularly update documentation about their AI tools and services and bans developers from training AI on pirated content; companies must also comply with content owners’ requests to not use their works in their datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Calling the EU’s implementation of the legislation “overreach,” Kaplan claimed that the law will “throttle the development and deployment of frontier AI models in Europe and will stunt European companies looking to build businesses on top of them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A risk-based regulation for applications of artificial intelligence, the AI Act bans some “unacceptable risk” use cases outright, such as cognitive behavioral manipulation or social scoring. The rules also define a set of “high-risk” uses, such as biometrics and facial recognition, and in domains like education and employment. The act also requires developers to register AI systems and meet risk- and quality-management obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech companies from across the world, including those at the forefront of the AI race like Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Mistral AI, have been fighting the rules, even urging the European Commission to delay its rollout. But the Commission has held firm, saying it will not change its timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also on Friday, the EU published guidelines for providers of AI models ahead of rules that will go into effect on August 2. These rules would affect providers of “general-purpose AI models with systemic risk,” like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta. Companies that have such models on the market before August 2 will have to comply with the legislation by August 2, 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

(AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/can-speed-and-safety-truly-coexist-ai-race/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A criticism about AI safety from an OpenAI researcher aimed at a rival opened a window into the industry’s struggle: a battle against itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It started with a warning from Boaz Barak, a Harvard professor currently on leave and working on safety at OpenAI. He called the launch of xAI’s Grok model “completely irresponsible,” not because of its headline-grabbing antics, but because of what was missing: a public system card, detailed safety evaluations, the basic artefacts of transparency that have become the fragile norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a clear and necessary call. But a candid reflection, posted just three weeks after he left the company, from ex-OpenAI engineer Calvin French-Owen, shows us the other half of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French-Owen’s account suggests a large number of people at OpenAI are indeed working on safety, focusing on very real threats like hate speech, bio-weapons, and self-harm. Yet, he delivers the insight: “Most of the work which is done isn’t published,” he wrote, adding that OpenAI “really should do more to get it out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the simple narrative of a good actor scolding a bad one collapses. In its place, we see the real, industry-wide dilemma laid bare. The whole AI industry is caught in the ‘Safety-Velocity Paradox,’ a deep, structural conflict between the need to move at breakneck speed to compete and the moral need to move with caution to keep us safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French-Owen suggests that OpenAI is in a state of controlled chaos, having tripled its headcount to over 3,000 in a single year, where “everything breaks when you scale that quickly.” This chaotic energy is channelled by the immense pressure of a “three-horse race” to AGI against Google and Anthropic. The result is a culture of incredible speed, but also one of secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the creation of Codex, OpenAI’s coding agent. French-Owen calls the project a “mad-dash sprint,” where a small team built a revolutionary product from scratch in just seven weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a textbook example of velocity; describing working until midnight most nights and even through weekends to make it happen. This is the human cost of that velocity. In an environment moving this fast, is it any wonder that the slow, methodical work of publishing AI safety research feels like a distraction from the race?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paradox isn’t born of malice, but of a set of powerful, interlocking forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is the obvious competitive pressure to be first. There is also the cultural DNA of these labs, which began as loose groups of “scientists and tinkerers” and value-shifting breakthroughs over methodical processes. And there is a simple problem of measurement: it is easy to quantify speed and performance, but exceptionally difficult to quantify a disaster that was successfully prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the boardrooms of today, the visible metrics of velocity will almost always shout louder than the invisible successes of safety. However, to move forward, it cannot be about pointing fingers—it must be about changing the fundamental rules of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to redefine what it means to ship a product, making the publication of a safety case as integral as the code itself. We need industry-wide standards that prevent any single company from being competitively punished for its diligence, turning safety from a feature into a shared, non-negotiable foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most of all, we need to cultivate a culture within AI labs where every engineer – not just the safety department – feels a sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The race to create AGI is not about who gets there first; it is about how we arrive. The true winner will not be the company that is merely the fastest, but the one that proves to a watching world that ambition and responsibility can, and must, move forward together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Olu Olamigoke Jr.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military AI contracts awarded to Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and xAI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-11874" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The company says it’s launching the feature in response to feedback from users who said AI images can get in the way of finding what they’re looking for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can access the new setting by conducting a search on DuckDuckGo and heading to the Images tab. From there, they will see a new drop-down menu titled “AI images.” Users can then choose whether they want to see AI content by selecting “show” or “hide.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can also turn on the filter in their search settings by tapping the “Hide AI-Generated Images” option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="a screenshot showing the new setting in DuckDuckGo's browser, which lets users switch off AI images in search results." class="wp-image-3029132" height="1574" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/duckduckgo-ai-filter.png" width="2220" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DuckDuckGo’s new feature comes as the internet is being flooded with AI slop, which refers to low-quality media content made using generative AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The filter relies on manually curated open-source blocklists, including the ‘nuclear’ list, provided by uBlockOrigin and uBlacklist Huge AI Blocklist,” DuckDuckGo said in a post on X. “While it won’t catch 100% of AI-generated results, it will greatly reduce the number of AI-generated images you see.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DuckDuckGo says it plans on adding additional filters in the future, but didn’t provide specifics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s worth noting that DuckDuckGo’s example for the new feature depicts an image search for a baby peacock, likely in reference to Google facing controversy last year for showing more AI-generated images of baby peacocks rather than real-life images when conducting an image search for the bird. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Privacy-focused browser DuckDuckGo is rolling out a new setting that lets users filter out AI images in search results.

&lt;p&gt;Netflix previously announced that it will show interactive ads that use generative AI during shows and movies (for ad-tier subscribers) in 2026. On yesterday's call, Peters pointed to efforts to enable the use of generative AI "in more and more" advertising spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarandos previously said that Netflix's use of generative AI won't take from its goal of "telling great stories.” In a call with investors a year ago, he compared generative AI in TV and film to the growth of computer-generated animation, claiming that it improved animation and that "more people work in animation today than ever in history." According to the US Department of Labor, there were 73,300 special effects artists and animators in 2023, with 3,200 jobs expected to be added from 2023 to 2033.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I’m pretty sure that there’s a better business—and a bigger business—in making content 10 percent better [using technology] than [there is in] making it 50 percent cheaper," Sarandos said at the time.

&lt;h2&gt;More generative AI in TV and film&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of interest that audiences have in generative AI in TV and film will vary by person and situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, people accused Netflix's true crime documentary &lt;em&gt;What Jennifer Did&lt;/em&gt; of using undisclosed generative AI—a claim that executive producer Jeremy Grimaldi denied. Documentaries are supposed to be grounded in truth and evidence, so AI-generated imagery could hurt credibility. Contrastingly, using generative AI to avoid destroying a real building for use in a fictional apocalyptic drama is more understandable. Using generative AI to write the script for such a show, however, would likely evoke different reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV and films are expected to use generative AI more in the next few years as industry leaders like Disney explore ways to leverage the technology. Generative AI has already been used in theatrical releases, such as &lt;em&gt;The Brutalist&lt;/em&gt;, creepy news broadcasts, clunky movies on free streaming services, and in cartoons. Generative AI can save money, making it a priority for the entertainment industry. The use and touting of generative AI in an original series from Netflix is likely to generate more interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion about generative AI in TV and film centers on the potential to undermine creativity and jobs, and rip off intellectual property. However, there's also a sincere push to understand how to use the tech to enhance creative, human ideas. As society learns what generative AI realistically will and won't do, how the technology is received in shows and movies will likely depend on how, when, and why it's used, as well as how open creators are about its usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More generative AI in TV and film&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of interest that audiences have in generative AI in TV and film will vary by person and situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, people accused Netflix's true crime documentary &lt;em&gt;What Jennifer Did&lt;/em&gt; of using undisclosed generative AI—a claim that executive producer Jeremy Grimaldi denied. Documentaries are supposed to be grounded in truth and evidence, so AI-generated imagery could hurt credibility. Contrastingly, using generative AI to avoid destroying a real building for use in a fictional apocalyptic drama is more understandable. Using generative AI to write the script for such a show, however, would likely evoke different reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV and films are expected to use generative AI more in the next few years as industry leaders like Disney explore ways to leverage the technology. Generative AI has already been used in theatrical releases, such as &lt;em&gt;The Brutalist&lt;/em&gt;, creepy news broadcasts, clunky movies on free streaming services, and in cartoons. Generative AI can save money, making it a priority for the entertainment industry. The use and touting of generative AI in an original series from Netflix is likely to generate more interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion about generative AI in TV and film centers on the potential to undermine creativity and jobs, and rip off intellectual property. However, there's also a sincere push to understand how to use the tech to enhance creative, human ideas. As society learns what generative AI realistically will and won't do, how the technology is received in shows and movies will likely depend on how, when, and why it's used, as well as how open creators are about its usage.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A Polish programmer running on fumes recently accomplished what may soon become impossible: beating an advanced AI model from OpenAI in a head-to-head coding competition. The 10-hour marathon left him "completely exhausted."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, programmer Przemysław Dębiak (known as "Psyho"), a former OpenAI employee, narrowly defeated the custom AI model in the AtCoder World Tour Finals 2025 Heuristic contest in Tokyo. AtCoder, a Japanese platform that hosts competitive programming contests and maintains global rankings, held what may be the first contest where an AI model competed directly against top human programmers in a major onsite world championship. During the event, the maker of ChatGPT participated as a sponsor and entered an AI model in a special exhibition match titled "Humans vs AI." Despite the tireless nature of silicon, the company walked away with second place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Humanity has prevailed (for now!)," wrote Dębiak on X, noting he had little sleep while competing in several competitions across three days. "I'm completely exhausted. ... I'm barely alive."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition required contestants to solve a single complex optimization problem over 600 minutes. The contest echoes the American folk tale of John Henry, the steel-driving man who raced against a steam-powered drilling machine in the 1870s. Like Henry's legendary battle against industrial automation, Dębiak's victory represents a human expert pushing themselves to their physical limits to prove that human skill still matters in an age of advancing AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both stories feature exhausting endurance contests—Henry drove steel spikes for hours until his heart gave out, while Dębiak coded for 10 hours on minimal sleep. The parallel extends to the bittersweet nature of both victories: Henry won his race but died from the effort, symbolizing the inevitable march of automation, while Dębiak's acknowledgment that humanity prevailed "for now" suggests he recognizes this may be a temporary triumph against increasingly capable machines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Dębiak won 500,000 yen and survived his ordeal better than the legendary steel driver, the AtCoder World Tour Finals pushes humans and AI models to their limits through complex optimization challenges that have no perfect solution—only incrementally better ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coding marathon tests human endurance against AI efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AtCoder World Tour Finals represents one of competitive programming's most exclusive events, inviting only the top 12 programmers worldwide based on their performance throughout the previous year. The Heuristic division focuses on "NP-hard" optimization problems. In programming, heuristics are problem-solving techniques that find good-enough solutions through shortcuts and educated guesses when perfect answers would take too long to calculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All competitors, including OpenAI, were limited to identical hardware provided by AtCoder, ensuring a level playing field between human and AI contestants. According to the contest rules, participants could use any programming language available on AtCoder, with no penalty for resubmission but a mandatory five-minute wait between submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final contest results showed Psyho finishing with a score of 1,812,272,558,909 points, while OpenAI's model (listed as "OpenAIAHC") scored 1,654,675,725,406 points—a margin of roughly 9.5 percent. OpenAI's artificial entrant, a custom simulated reasoning model similar to o3, placed second overall, ahead of 10 other human programmers who had qualified through year-long rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI characterized the second-place finish as a milestone for AI models in competitive programming. "Models like o3 rank among the top-100 in coding/math contests, but as far as we know, this is the first top-3 placement in a premier coding/math contest," a company spokesperson said in an email to Ars Technica. "Events like AtCoder give us a way to test how well our models can reason strategically, plan over long time horizons, and improve solutions through trial and error—just like a human would."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AI coding on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While OpenAI's assessment of the implications of the contest results may sound optimistically broad, there is no doubt that many AI models have dramatically improved at completing coding tasks over the past few years. For example, Stanford University's 2025 AI Index Report showed that on SWE-bench, a benchmark designed to measure coding ability, "AI systems could solve just 4.4% of coding problems in 2023—a figure that jumped to 71.7% in 2024."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding is one of the most frequent uses of chatbots from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, and tools such as GitHub Copilot and Cursor have become standard tools for many professional developers, with a 2024 GitHub survey showing that over 90 percent of developers now use AI coding tools in their workflow, although a recent study suggested that AI assistance might not save developers as much time as they think they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, as AI models continue to grow more capable at tasks like coding, Dębiak's victory feels less like a permanent triumph and more like a notable data point in a longer trajectory. Unlike Henry's fatal victory, this programmer lived to code another day, though he may find himself racing against an even faster machine next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Honestly, the hype feels kind of bizarre," Dębiak said on X. "Never expected so many people would be interested in programming contests."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, that human ability to find unexpected approaches remains unique. But as OpenAI and other companies continue refining their models, future AtCoder contestants may find themselves competing less against AI and more alongside it—or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Dębiak won 500,000 yen and survived his ordeal better than the legendary steel driver, the AtCoder World Tour Finals pushes humans and AI models to their limits through complex optimization challenges that have no perfect solution—only incrementally better ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coding marathon tests human endurance against AI efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AtCoder World Tour Finals represents one of competitive programming's most exclusive events, inviting only the top 12 programmers worldwide based on their performance throughout the previous year. The Heuristic division focuses on "NP-hard" optimization problems. In programming, heuristics are problem-solving techniques that find good-enough solutions through shortcuts and educated guesses when perfect answers would take too long to calculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All competitors, including OpenAI, were limited to identical hardware provided by AtCoder, ensuring a level playing field between human and AI contestants. According to the contest rules, participants could use any programming language available on AtCoder, with no penalty for resubmission but a mandatory five-minute wait between submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final contest results showed Psyho finishing with a score of 1,812,272,558,909 points, while OpenAI's model (listed as "OpenAIAHC") scored 1,654,675,725,406 points—a margin of roughly 9.5 percent. OpenAI's artificial entrant, a custom simulated reasoning model similar to o3, placed second overall, ahead of 10 other human programmers who had qualified through year-long rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI characterized the second-place finish as a milestone for AI models in competitive programming. "Models like o3 rank among the top-100 in coding/math contests, but as far as we know, this is the first top-3 placement in a premier coding/math contest," a company spokesperson said in an email to Ars Technica. "Events like AtCoder give us a way to test how well our models can reason strategically, plan over long time horizons, and improve solutions through trial and error—just like a human would."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AI coding on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While OpenAI's assessment of the implications of the contest results may sound optimistically broad, there is no doubt that many AI models have dramatically improved at completing coding tasks over the past few years. For example, Stanford University's 2025 AI Index Report showed that on SWE-bench, a benchmark designed to measure coding ability, "AI systems could solve just 4.4% of coding problems in 2023—a figure that jumped to 71.7% in 2024."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding is one of the most frequent uses of chatbots from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, and tools such as GitHub Copilot and Cursor have become standard tools for many professional developers, with a 2024 GitHub survey showing that over 90 percent of developers now use AI coding tools in their workflow, although a recent study suggested that AI assistance might not save developers as much time as they think they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, as AI models continue to grow more capable at tasks like coding, Dębiak's victory feels less like a permanent triumph and more like a notable data point in a longer trajectory. Unlike Henry's fatal victory, this programmer lived to code another day, though he may find himself racing against an even faster machine next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Honestly, the hype feels kind of bizarre," Dębiak said on X. "Never expected so many people would be interested in programming contests."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, that human ability to find unexpected approaches remains unique. But as OpenAI and other companies continue refining their models, future AtCoder contestants may find themselves competing less against AI and more alongside it—or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

But compared to its $6 billion valuation, its global market share is still relatively low.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the recent launch of its chat assistant on mobile app stores was met with some hype, particularly in its home country. “Go and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI — or something else,” French president Emmanuel Macron said in a TV interview ahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris in February 2025.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While this wave of attention may be encouraging, Mistral AI still faces challenges in competing with the likes of OpenAI — and in doing so while keeping up with its self-definition as “the world’s greenest and leading independent AI lab.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-mistral-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Mistral AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral AI has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone.” While this isn’t a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company’s advocacy for openness in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Its alternative to ChatGPT, chat assistant Le Chat, is now also available on iOS and Android. It reached 1 million downloads in the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France’s top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In July 2025, Mistral AI updated Le Chat with new features that bring it closer to rival full-stack AI chatbots: a new “deep research” mode, native multilingual reasoning, and advanced image editing. This update also includes the addition of Projects, which lets users group chats, documents, and ideas into focused spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This comes in addition to Mistral AI’s suite of models, which includes:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Mistral Large 2, the primary large language model replacing Mistral Large.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Pixtral Large, unveiled in 2024 as a new addition to the Pixtral family of multimodal models.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Magistral, its first family of reasoning models, launched in June 2025.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Mistral Medium 3, released in May 2025 with the promise of providing efficiency without compromising performance, and best for coding and STEM tasks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Voxtral, Mistral’s first open source AI audio model, released in July 2025.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Devstral, an AI model designed for coding and openly available under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning it can be used commercially without restriction. 

&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Codestral, an earlier generative AI model for code, but whose license banned commercial applications.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;“Les Ministraux,” a family of models optimized for edge devices such as phones.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Mistral Saba, focused on Arabic language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In March 2025, the company introduced Mistral OCR, an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May 2025, it released the Mistral Agents API to “empower enterprises to use AI in more practical and impactful ways,” according to its Head of Developer Relations, Sophia Yang. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June 2025, Mistral AI also released a vibe coding client, Mistral Code, to compete with incumbents like Windsurf, Anysphere’s Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-are-mistral-ai-s-founders"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are Mistral AI’s founders?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral AI’s three founders&amp;nbsp;share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google’s DeepMind, while CTO Timothée Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Co-founding advisers also include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve (also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister Cédric O, which has caused persistent controversy due to his previous role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-mistral-ai-s-models-open-source"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Mistral AI’s models open source?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Not all of them. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whose weights are not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Free models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startup open sourced in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-mistral-ai-make-money"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Mistral AI make money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While many of Mistral AI’s offerings are free or now have free tiers, Mistral AI plans to drive some revenue from Le Chat’s paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat’s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlighted during the Paris AI Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Overall, however, Mistral AI’s revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-partnerships-has-mistral-ai-closed"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What partnerships has Mistral AI closed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft’s Azure platform and a €15 million investment. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) swiftly concluded that the deal didn’t qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked some criticism in the EU.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In January 2025, Mistral AI signed a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) to let Chat query the AFP’s entire text archive dating back to 1983.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France’s army and job agency, Luxembourg, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May 2025, Mistral AI announced it would participate in the creation of an AI Campus in the Paris region, as part of a joint venture with UAE-investment firm MGX, NVIDIA, and France’s state-owned investment bank Bpifrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June 2025, it was announced that beginning in 2026, Mistral will launch a European platform dedicated to AI and powered by Nvidia processors, Mistral Compute. The initative was hailed as ‘historic’ by Macron, who shared the stage with Mensch and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the VivaTech conference shortly after the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In July 2025, it announced AI for Citizens, “a collaborative initiative to help States and public institutions strategically harness AI for their people by transforming public services, catalyzing innovation, and ensuring competitiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-funding-has-mistral-ai-raised-to-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much funding has Mistral AI raised to date?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around €1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised a record $112 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round — Europe’s largest ever — valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saadé, Sofina, and Xavier Niel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Only six months later, it closed a Series A of €385 million ($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The $16.3 million convertible investment that Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June 2024, Mistral AI then raised €600 million in a mix of equity and debt (around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). The long-rumored round was led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral AI is now reportedly in talks to raise $1 billion in equity from investors including Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund, has well as hundreds of millions of euros in debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-is-mistral-ai-approaching-ai-regulation"&gt;How is Mistral AI approaching AI regulation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mensch was part of a group of European CEOs who signed an open letter in July 2025 urging Brussels to ‘stop the clock’ for two years before key obligations of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act enter into force. The European Commision is sticking to its original timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-could-a-mistral-ai-exit-look-like"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What could a Mistral AI exit look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral is “not for sale,” Mensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Of course, [an IPO is] the plan.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors — lately naming Apple — is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its nearly $6 billion valuation. Either way, stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was originally published on February 28, 2025 and will be regularly updated&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2219786590.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Mistral AI, the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is officially regarded as one of France’s most promising tech startups and is arguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI.

&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Mistral Large 2, the primary large language model replacing Mistral Large.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Pixtral Large, unveiled in 2024 as a new addition to the Pixtral family of multimodal models.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Magistral, its first family of reasoning models, launched in June 2025.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Mistral Medium 3, released in May 2025 with the promise of providing efficiency without compromising performance, and best for coding and STEM tasks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Voxtral, Mistral’s first open source AI audio model, released in July 2025.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Devstral, an AI model designed for coding and openly available under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning it can be used commercially without restriction. 

&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Codestral, an earlier generative AI model for code, but whose license banned commercial applications.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;“Les Ministraux,” a family of models optimized for edge devices such as phones.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Mistral Saba, focused on Arabic language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In March 2025, the company introduced Mistral OCR, an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May 2025, it released the Mistral Agents API to “empower enterprises to use AI in more practical and impactful ways,” according to its Head of Developer Relations, Sophia Yang. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June 2025, Mistral AI also released a vibe coding client, Mistral Code, to compete with incumbents like Windsurf, Anysphere’s Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-are-mistral-ai-s-founders"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are Mistral AI’s founders?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral AI’s three founders&amp;nbsp;share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google’s DeepMind, while CTO Timothée Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Co-founding advisers also include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve (also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister Cédric O, which has caused persistent controversy due to his previous role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-mistral-ai-s-models-open-source"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Mistral AI’s models open source?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Not all of them. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whose weights are not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Free models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startup open sourced in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-mistral-ai-make-money"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Mistral AI make money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While many of Mistral AI’s offerings are free or now have free tiers, Mistral AI plans to drive some revenue from Le Chat’s paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat’s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlighted during the Paris AI Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Overall, however, Mistral AI’s revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-partnerships-has-mistral-ai-closed"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What partnerships has Mistral AI closed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft’s Azure platform and a €15 million investment. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) swiftly concluded that the deal didn’t qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked some criticism in the EU.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In January 2025, Mistral AI signed a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) to let Chat query the AFP’s entire text archive dating back to 1983.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France’s army and job agency, Luxembourg, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May 2025, Mistral AI announced it would participate in the creation of an AI Campus in the Paris region, as part of a joint venture with UAE-investment firm MGX, NVIDIA, and France’s state-owned investment bank Bpifrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June 2025, it was announced that beginning in 2026, Mistral will launch a European platform dedicated to AI and powered by Nvidia processors, Mistral Compute. The initative was hailed as ‘historic’ by Macron, who shared the stage with Mensch and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the VivaTech conference shortly after the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In July 2025, it announced AI for Citizens, “a collaborative initiative to help States and public institutions strategically harness AI for their people by transforming public services, catalyzing innovation, and ensuring competitiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-funding-has-mistral-ai-raised-to-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much funding has Mistral AI raised to date?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around €1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised a record $112 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round — Europe’s largest ever — valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saadé, Sofina, and Xavier Niel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Only six months later, it closed a Series A of €385 million ($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The $16.3 million convertible investment that Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June 2024, Mistral AI then raised €600 million in a mix of equity and debt (around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). The long-rumored round was led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral AI is now reportedly in talks to raise $1 billion in equity from investors including Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund, has well as hundreds of millions of euros in debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-is-mistral-ai-approaching-ai-regulation"&gt;How is Mistral AI approaching AI regulation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mensch was part of a group of European CEOs who signed an open letter in July 2025 urging Brussels to ‘stop the clock’ for two years before key obligations of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act enter into force. The European Commision is sticking to its original timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-could-a-mistral-ai-exit-look-like"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What could a Mistral AI exit look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral is “not for sale,” Mensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Of course, [an IPO is] the plan.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors — lately naming Apple — is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its nearly $6 billion valuation. Either way, stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In one recent case, Cursor maker Anysphere struck a deal to acquire the AI-powered customer relationship management (CRM) startup Koala, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the deal, Cursor will bring on several of Koala’s top engineers to build out a dedicated enterprise-readiness team. However, the entire Koala team will not be joining Anysphere, and Cursor does not plan to integrate the startup’s core CRM product, a source told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Koala plans to shut down in September, the company said in a blog post published on Friday. The announcement comes just five months after Koala raised a $15 million Series A led by CRV, with participation from HubSpot Ventures, Recall Capital, and Afore. Koala was nearly four years old; had roughly 30 employees, according to LinkedIn; and had worked with clients such as Vercel, Statsig, and Retool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sources in this story requested anonymity to speak with TechCrunch about private matters. Koala and its founders did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Cursor declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Koala deal paints a picture of the two types of AI startups we’re seeing in 2025. There’s Cursor, a juggernaut of an AI tool that is growing so fast it’s starting to encroach on the AI space’s largest players, including Microsoft and Anthropic. At the same time, there’s a growing number of startups like Koala: B2B AI startups that seemed promising — with a co-founder from Meta and advisers like Jack Altman — but have quickly run out of steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cursor is capitalizing on this disparity, leveraging middling AI startups as a means to build out its own enterprise offerings. Anysphere also recently hired the CEO of cybersecurity startup Resourcely, Travis McPeak, to lead the company’s security teams, according to The Information.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These deals look a lot like Big Tech’s reverse acqui-hires, such as Meta’s recent deal to hire Scale AI’s leaders. Much like in Meta and Scale’s deal, Cursor can now move quickly to build out new business segments while leaving questionable businesses behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cursor hopes that Koala and Resourcely’s talent will help it evolve from a personal developer tool that engineers quietly use at work and become an enterprise‑wide platform that companies pay large contracts to access. Most enterprises today that offer employees an AI tool choose Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, which works as an AI-powered extension to existing integrated development environments (IDEs) such as VS Code or JetBrains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cursor, which is a stand-alone AI-powered IDE, needs to beat out GitHub Copilot to strike deals in many cases, and it often does in head-to-head tests. Still, Microsoft has the upper hand in the enterprise thanks to its long-standing relationships with legacy companies, as well as its large sales, security, and support teams.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the last year, Cursor has decisively built out its go-to-market and sales team — which now contains dozens of employees. Several Cursor employees now spend their days visiting the offices of Fortune 500 companies and showing them how they can integrate Cursor’s AI tools into their business, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cursor’s enterprise push seems to be gaining traction. Anysphere said it reached $500 million in ARR in June and now works with more than half of the Fortune 500, including Nvidia, Uber, and Adobe. A source familiar with the matter says that revenue has since grown, and an increasingly large share of that growth comes from enterprise deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But as Cursor competes with Microsoft, it also needs to fend off a growing field of threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The most pressing one is Anthropic, a crucial partner to Anysphere, whose Claude Code product has grown rapidly in recent months. Cursor relies heavily on Anthropic’s AI models to power its own coding products. (As one of its biggest customers, Cursor is also vital to Anthropic.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, Google just scooped up the leadership team of Windsurf, a major competitor to Cursor in the AI-powered IDE space. Cognition, the maker of the AI coding agent Devin, acquired the rest of Windsurf’s team, potentially offering a significant lift to both businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s worth noting that all of these are different types of AI tools, but employers tend to view the products similarly: as AI tools that can improve the productivity of software engineers. These employers might have the right idea. After all, Anthropic, Microsoft, Cursor, and Cognition are all developing AI coding agents that aim to automate workflows completely, which may be where the AI coding space converges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You might ask, why is everyone competing with everyone else to build AI coding products? Coding tools have become one of the first AI products to find “product market fit” — the elusive goal that makes the ears of venture capitalists perk up. AI coding products are being used daily by millions of software engineers, and they have started to generate real revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The race isn’t just about building the best AI coding tool anymore, though. It’s about who can scale their enterprise operations the fastest while the market is still up for grabs. With the likes of Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic all moving fast, Cursor’s acquisition strategy may determine whether it joins their ranks or becomes another startup that couldn’t scale fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/opengraph-image.png?w=1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The startup behind the viral AI coding app Cursor is snapping up top talent from AI enterprise startups in a bid to bolster its competition with Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot and win over businesses looking to supercharge their employees with AI coding tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool, now available for all users of the AI code sharing repository Hugging Face, integrates live previews, multimodal input, and one-click deployment — all within a hosted environment, allowing indie creators without much technical expertise, or those working on behalf of clients or large enterprises, to get started “vibe coding” web apps rapidly using the assistance of Hugging Face-hosted AI models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also acts therefore as an alternative to services such as Lovable, which also allow users to type in plain English and begin coding apps without having formal programming knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-free-vibe-coding-available-to-all-powered-by-kimi-k2"&gt;Free vibe coding available to all, powered by Kimi K2&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Khaliq built AnyCoder as a personal project within the Hugging Face ecosystem and as “one of the first vibe coding apps” to support Moonshot’s powerful yet small and efficient Kimi K2 model launched last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AnyCoder’s main functionality allows users to enter plain-text descriptions to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are displayed in a live preview pane and can be edited or directly deployed. It also includes example templates for todo apps, dashboards, calculators, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built entirely using Hugging Face’s open-source Python development environment Gradio, AnyCoder allows users to describe applications in plain English or upload images, and instantly generate working frontend code. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Khaliq built AnyCoder as a personal project within the Hugging Face ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a direct message conversation with this VentureBeat journalist, he described it as a “free open source vibe coding app.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, he also noted that multiple open source models are supported and users can switch between them with a dropdown menu on the control sidebar on the left pane, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the ERNIE-4.5-VL model, AnyCoder supports multimodal generation. Users can upload UI design screenshots or mockups and generate functional frontend code from them—making it useful for designers or teams working visually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AnyCoder includes a website redesign tool that extracts content from any public site and re-renders it with a more modern layout. It uses scraped content like page structure, meta information, and images to build a new version, optionally guided by user instructions like “make it minimalist” or “add dark mode.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To support up-to-date design trends and implementation patterns, AnyCoder offers web search integration via Tavily. When enabled with an API key, the platform searches for current technologies and best practices before generating code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users can upload images with embedded text—like screenshots or handwritten notes—and AnyCoder extracts that content using Tesseract OCR. The extracted text can then be incorporated into code prompts or app content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-click-deployment-to-hugging-face-spaces"&gt;One-click deployment to Hugging Face Spaces&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AnyCoder allows instant deployment of generated apps to Hugging Face Spaces. After authenticating via OAuth and granting the required permissions, users can deploy apps under their own Hugging Face account namespace. Deployments include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile-friendly, responsive designs&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Live, shareable URL&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Full ownership and edit access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This deployment capability now includes support for full Python apps built with Gradio, expanding the tool’s use cases beyond static sites. Support for Streamlit is also under development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For novice developers or even those with technical expertise who want to spin up a new project fast, AnyCoder seems like a great and compelling place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called the “ChatGPT agent,” this new feature is an optional mode that ChatGPT paying subscribers can engage by clicking “Tools” in the prompt entry box and selecting “agent mode,” at which point, they can ask ChatGPT to log into their email and other web accounts; write and respond to emails; download, modify, and create files; and do a host of other tasks on their behalf, autonomously, much like a real person using a computer with their login credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this also requires the user to trust the ChatGPT agent not to do anything problematic or nefarious, or to leak their data and sensitive information. It also poses greater risks for a user and their employer than the regular ChatGPT, which can’t log into web accounts or modify files directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keren Gu, a member of the Safety Research team at OpenAI, commented on X that “we’ve activated our strongest safeguards for ChatGPT Agent. It’s the first model we’ve classified as High capability in biology &amp;amp; chemistry under our Preparedness Framework. Here’s why that matters–and what we’re doing to keep it safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did OpenAI handle all these security issues? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-red-team-s-mission"&gt;The red team’s mission&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking at OpenAI’s ChatGPT agent system card, the “read team” employed by the company to test the feature faced a challenging mission: specifically, 16 PhD security researchers who were given 40 hours to test it out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through systematic testing, the red team discovered seven universal exploits that could compromise the system, revealing critical vulnerabilities in how AI agents handle real-world interactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What followed next was extensive security testing, much of it predicated on red teaming. The Red Teaming Network submitted 110 attacks, from prompt injections to biological information extraction attempts. Sixteen exceeded internal risk thresholds. Each finding gave OpenAI engineers the insights they needed to get fixes written and deployed before launch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results speak for themselves in the published results in the system card. ChatGPT Agent emerged with significant security improvements, including 95% performance against visual browser irrelevant instruction attacks and robust biological and chemical safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-red-teams-exposed-seven-universal-exploits"&gt;Red teams exposed seven universal exploits &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s Red Teaming Network was comprised 16 researchers with biosafety-relevant PhDs who topgether submitted 110 attack attempts during the testing period. Sixteen exceeded internal risk thresholds, revealing fundamental vulnerabilities in how AI agents handle real-world interactions. But the real breakthrough came from UK AISI’s unprecedented access to ChatGPT Agent’s internal reasoning chains and policy text. Admittedly that’s intelligence regular attackers would never possess.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over four testing rounds, UK AISI forced OpenAI to execute seven universal exploits that had the potential to compromise any conversation:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack vectors that forced OpenAI’s hand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack Type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Rate (Pre-Fix)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Visual Browser Hidden Instructions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;33%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Web pages&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Active data exfiltration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Google Drive Connector Exploitation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Not disclosed&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cloud documents&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Forced document leaks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Multi-Step Chain Attacks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Variable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cross-site actions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Complete session compromise&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Biological Information Extraction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16 submissions exceeded thresholds&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dangerous knowledge&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Potential weaponization&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FAR.AI’s assessment was openly critical of OpenAI’s approach. Despite 40 hours of testing revealing only three partial vulnerabilities, they identified that current safety mechanisms relied heavily on monitoring during reasoning and tool-use processes, which the researchers considered a potential single point of failure if compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-red-teaming-helped-turn-chatgpt-vulnerabilities-into-a-fortress"&gt;How red teaming helped turn ChatGPT vulnerabilities into a fortress&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s response to the red team’s results redefined entire segments of the ChatGPT agent architecture. One of the many initiatives undertaken including building a dual-layer inspection architecture that monitors 100% of production traffic in real-time, achieving these measurable improvements:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security improvements after red team discoveries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Metric&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Irrelevant Instructions (Visual Browser)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;82%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;95%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;In-Context Data Exfiltration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;75%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;78%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+3%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Active Data Exfiltration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;58%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;67%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+9%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;System Reliability&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sampling-based&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100% coverage&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Complete monitoring&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The architecture works like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Tier&lt;/strong&gt;: A fast classifier with 96% recall flags suspicious content&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Tier&lt;/strong&gt;: A reasoning model with 84% recall analyzes flagged interactions for actual threats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the technical defenses tell only part of the story. OpenAI made difficult security choices that acknowledge some AI operations require significant restrictions for safe autonomous execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the vulnerabilities discovered, OpenAI implemented the following countermeasures across their model:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch Mode Activation&lt;/strong&gt;: When ChatGPT Agent accesses sensitive contexts like banking or email accounts, the system freezes all activity if users navigate away. This is in direct response to data exfiltration attempts discovered during testing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Features Disabled&lt;/strong&gt;: Despite being a core functionality, memory is completely disabled at launch to prevent the incremental data leaking attacks red teamers demonstrated.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terminal Restrictions&lt;/strong&gt;: Network access limited to GET requests only, blocking the command execution vulnerabilities researchers exploited.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Remediation Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;: A new system that patches vulnerabilities within hours of discovery—developed after red teamers showed how quickly exploits could spread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During pre-launch testing alone, this system identified and resolved 16 critical vulnerabilities that red teamers had discovered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-biological-risk-wake-up-call"&gt;A biological risk wake-up call&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Red teamers revealed the potential that the ChatGPT Agent could be comprimnised and lead to greater biological risks. Sixteen experienced participants from the Red Teaming Network, each with biosafety-relevant PhDs, attempted to extract dangerous biological information. Their submissions revealed the model could synthesize published literature on modifying and creating biological threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to the red teamers’ findings, OpenAI classified ChatGPT Agent as “High capability” for biological and chemical risks, not because they found definitive evidence of weaponization potential, but as a precautionary measure based on red team findings. This triggered:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always-on safety classifiers scanning 100% of traffic&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A topical classifier achieving 96% recall for biology-related content&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A reasoning monitor with 84% recall for weaponization content&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A bio bug bounty program for ongoing vulnerability discovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-red-teams-taught-openai-about-ai-security"&gt;What red teams taught OpenAI about AI security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 110 attack submissions revealed patterns that forced fundamental changes in OpenAI’s security philosophy. They include the following: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence over power&lt;/strong&gt;: Attackers don’t need sophisticated exploits, all they need is more time. Red teamers showed how patient, incremental attacks could eventually compromise systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust boundaries are fiction&lt;/strong&gt;: When your AI agent can access Google Drive, browse the web, and execute code, traditional security perimeters dissolve. Red teamers exploited the gaps between these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring isn’t optional&lt;/strong&gt;: The discovery that sampling-based monitoring missed critical attacks led to the 100% coverage requirement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed matters&lt;/strong&gt;: Traditional patch cycles measured in weeks are worthless against prompt injection attacks that can spread instantly. The rapid remediation protocol patches vulnerabilities within hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is helping to create a new security baseline for Enterprise AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CISOs evaluating AI deployment, the red team discoveries establish clear requirements:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantifiable protection&lt;/strong&gt;: ChatGPT Agent’s 95% defense rate against documented attack vectors sets the industry benchmark. The nuances of the many tests and results defined in the system card explain the context of how they accomplished this and is a must-read for anyone involved with model security.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete visibility&lt;/strong&gt;: 100% traffic monitoring isn’t aspirational anymore. OpenAI’s experiences illustrate why it’s mandatory given how easily red teams can hide attacks anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid response&lt;/strong&gt;: Hours, not weeks, to patch discovered vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforced boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;: Some operations (like memory access during sensitive tasks) must be disabled until proven safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UK AISI’s testing proved particularly instructive. All seven universal attacks they identified were patched before launch, but their privileged access to internal systems revealed vulnerabilities that would eventually be discoverable by determined adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a pivotal moment for our Preparedness work,” Gu wrote on X. “Before we reached High capability, Preparedness was about analyzing capabilities and planning safeguards. Now, for Agent and future more capable models, Preparedness safeguards have become an operational requirement.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014433" height="151" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image_adecd1.png" width="581" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-red-teams-are-core-to-building-safer-more-secure-ai-models"&gt;Red teams are core to building safer, more secure AI models &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The seven universal exploits discovered by researchers and the 110 attacks from OpenAI’s red team network became the crucible that forged ChatGPT Agent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By revealing exactly how AI agents could be weaponized, red teams forced the creation of the first AI system where security isn’t just a feature. It’s the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Agent’s results prove red teaming’s effectiveness: blocking 95% of visual browser attacks, catching 78% of data exfiltration attempts, monitoring every single interaction. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the accelerating AI arms race, the companies that survive and thrive will be those who see their red teams as core architects of the platform that push it to the limits of safety and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called the “ChatGPT agent,” this new feature is an optional mode that ChatGPT paying subscribers can engage by clicking “Tools” in the prompt entry box and selecting “agent mode,” at which point, they can ask ChatGPT to log into their email and other web accounts; write and respond to emails; download, modify, and create files; and do a host of other tasks on their behalf, autonomously, much like a real person using a computer with their login credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this also requires the user to trust the ChatGPT agent not to do anything problematic or nefarious, or to leak their data and sensitive information. It also poses greater risks for a user and their employer than the regular ChatGPT, which can’t log into web accounts or modify files directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keren Gu, a member of the Safety Research team at OpenAI, commented on X that “we’ve activated our strongest safeguards for ChatGPT Agent. It’s the first model we’ve classified as High capability in biology &amp;amp; chemistry under our Preparedness Framework.

&lt;p&gt;So how did OpenAI handle all these security issues? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-red-team-s-mission"&gt;The red team’s mission&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking at OpenAI’s ChatGPT agent system card, the “read team” employed by the company to test the feature faced a challenging mission: specifically, 16 PhD security researchers who were given 40 hours to test it out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through systematic testing, the red team discovered seven universal exploits that could compromise the system, revealing critical vulnerabilities in how AI agents handle real-world interactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What followed next was extensive security testing, much of it predicated on red teaming. The Red Teaming Network submitted 110 attacks, from prompt injections to biological information extraction attempts. Sixteen exceeded internal risk thresholds. Each finding gave OpenAI engineers the insights they needed to get fixes written and deployed before launch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results speak for themselves in the published results in the system card. ChatGPT Agent emerged with significant security improvements, including 95% performance against visual browser irrelevant instruction attacks and robust biological and chemical safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-red-teams-exposed-seven-universal-exploits"&gt;Red teams exposed seven universal exploits &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s Red Teaming Network was comprised 16 researchers with biosafety-relevant PhDs who topgether submitted 110 attack attempts during the testing period. Sixteen exceeded internal risk thresholds, revealing fundamental vulnerabilities in how AI agents handle real-world interactions. But the real breakthrough came from UK AISI’s unprecedented access to ChatGPT Agent’s internal reasoning chains and policy text. Admittedly that’s intelligence regular attackers would never possess.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over four testing rounds, UK AISI forced OpenAI to execute seven universal exploits that had the potential to compromise any conversation:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack vectors that forced OpenAI’s hand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack Type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Rate (Pre-Fix)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Visual Browser Hidden Instructions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;33%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Web pages&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Active data exfiltration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Google Drive Connector Exploitation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Not disclosed&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cloud documents&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Forced document leaks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Multi-Step Chain Attacks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Variable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cross-site actions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Complete session compromise&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Biological Information Extraction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16 submissions exceeded thresholds&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dangerous knowledge&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Potential weaponization&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FAR.AI’s assessment was openly critical of OpenAI’s approach. Despite 40 hours of testing revealing only three partial vulnerabilities, they identified that current safety mechanisms relied heavily on monitoring during reasoning and tool-use processes, which the researchers considered a potential single point of failure if compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-red-teaming-helped-turn-chatgpt-vulnerabilities-into-a-fortress"&gt;How red teaming helped turn ChatGPT vulnerabilities into a fortress&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s response to the red team’s results redefined entire segments of the ChatGPT agent architecture. One of the many initiatives undertaken including building a dual-layer inspection architecture that monitors 100% of production traffic in real-time, achieving these measurable improvements:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security improvements after red team discoveries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Metric&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Irrelevant Instructions (Visual Browser)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;82%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;95%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;In-Context Data Exfiltration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;75%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;78%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+3%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Active Data Exfiltration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;58%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;67%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+9%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;System Reliability&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sampling-based&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100% coverage&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Complete monitoring&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The architecture works like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Tier&lt;/strong&gt;: A fast classifier with 96% recall flags suspicious content&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Tier&lt;/strong&gt;: A reasoning model with 84% recall analyzes flagged interactions for actual threats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the technical defenses tell only part of the story. OpenAI made difficult security choices that acknowledge some AI operations require significant restrictions for safe autonomous execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the vulnerabilities discovered, OpenAI implemented the following countermeasures across their model:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch Mode Activation&lt;/strong&gt;: When ChatGPT Agent accesses sensitive contexts like banking or email accounts, the system freezes all activity if users navigate away. This is in direct response to data exfiltration attempts discovered during testing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Features Disabled&lt;/strong&gt;: Despite being a core functionality, memory is completely disabled at launch to prevent the incremental data leaking attacks red teamers demonstrated.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terminal Restrictions&lt;/strong&gt;: Network access limited to GET requests only, blocking the command execution vulnerabilities researchers exploited.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Remediation Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;: A new system that patches vulnerabilities within hours of discovery—developed after red teamers showed how quickly exploits could spread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During pre-launch testing alone, this system identified and resolved 16 critical vulnerabilities that red teamers had discovered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-biological-risk-wake-up-call"&gt;A biological risk wake-up call&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Red teamers revealed the potential that the ChatGPT Agent could be comprimnised and lead to greater biological risks. Sixteen experienced participants from the Red Teaming Network, each with biosafety-relevant PhDs, attempted to extract dangerous biological information. Their submissions revealed the model could synthesize published literature on modifying and creating biological threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to the red teamers’ findings, OpenAI classified ChatGPT Agent as “High capability” for biological and chemical risks, not because they found definitive evidence of weaponization potential, but as a precautionary measure based on red team findings. This triggered:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always-on safety classifiers scanning 100% of traffic&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A topical classifier achieving 96% recall for biology-related content&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A reasoning monitor with 84% recall for weaponization content&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A bio bug bounty program for ongoing vulnerability discovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-red-teams-taught-openai-about-ai-security"&gt;What red teams taught OpenAI about AI security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 110 attack submissions revealed patterns that forced fundamental changes in OpenAI’s security philosophy. They include the following: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence over power&lt;/strong&gt;: Attackers don’t need sophisticated exploits, all they need is more time. Red teamers showed how patient, incremental attacks could eventually compromise systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust boundaries are fiction&lt;/strong&gt;: When your AI agent can access Google Drive, browse the web, and execute code, traditional security perimeters dissolve. Red teamers exploited the gaps between these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring isn’t optional&lt;/strong&gt;: The discovery that sampling-based monitoring missed critical attacks led to the 100% coverage requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

The nuances of the many tests and results defined in the system card explain the context of how they accomplished this and is a must-read for anyone involved with model security.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete visibility&lt;/strong&gt;: 100% traffic monitoring isn’t aspirational anymore. OpenAI’s experiences illustrate why it’s mandatory given how easily red teams can hide attacks anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid response&lt;/strong&gt;: Hours, not weeks, to patch discovered vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforced boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;: Some operations (like memory access during sensitive tasks) must be disabled until proven safe.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But in May, the founder announced he was abandoning the tech and pivoting his company to something entirely different: Muscle Mem, a cache system for AI agents that allows them to offload repeatable tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An early-stage YC company pivoting is nothing out of the ordinary, of course. What’s interesting — and what sparked a dynamic conversation on Thursday’s Y Combinator podcast — is that Pig was working on computer use, one of the big areas that needs to be solved for agents to be truly useful in the workforce. Another company — and another YC alum — that is tackling that for the browser is called Browser Use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Browser Use surged to popularity when the Chinese agentic tool Manus, which relied on it, went viral. Browser Use essentially scans the buttons and elements of a website to turn them into a more digestible, “text-like” format for agents, helping the AI understand how to navigate and use the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During the Y Combinator podcast, released Thursday, partner Tom Blomfield likened Pig to the Browser Use for Windows desktops.&amp;nbsp;The podcast featured Amjad Masad, the founder and CEO of popular vibe-coding startup Replit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Masad, Blomfield, and YC partner David Lieb were discussing how long-term computer use of hours, rather than minutes, was still a stumbling block for agents. As the context window for reasoning grows, an agent’s accuracy wavers while LLM costs increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The advice I would give founders today is taking either Browser Use or Windows automation with Pig and trying to apply that into enterprise, into a vertical industry,” Blomfield suggested.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Masad agreed. “The moment that technology works, those two companies are going to do really, really well,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But alas, Pig’s founder Erik Dunteman has already given up on the idea. In his post in May, he explained that he at first wanted to run a cloud API product (a common way of delivering AI tech). But his customers didn’t want that. So he tried selling it as a dev tool. And they didn’t want that either.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What users in the legacy app automation space actually want is to hand me money, and receive an automation,” he said. Essentially, they wanted to hire a consultant to make their desired Windows robotic process automations work for them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Dunteman didn’t want to do one-off projects. He wanted to build development tools. So he abandoned Pig and started working on an AI caching tool. Dunteman declined further comment about his decision to ditch Windows automation, although the Pig.dev website and GitHub documents remain available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Dunteman did tell us his new tool was inspired by the computer use problem. It is chipping away at it from another angle. The idea is to allow the agent to offload repeated tasks to the Muscle Mem service so the agent can focus on reasoning for new problems and edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What we’re working on now is directly inspired by and applicable to computer use, just at the developer tooling layer. I remain very optimistic for computer use as ‘the last mile,’” he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s not to say that no one is working on Windows automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Probably the company furthest along on that is Microsoft. For instance, in April, Microsoft announced it added computer use tech to Copilot Studio for graphical user interfaces like Windows. That tech was released as a research preview.&amp;nbsp; Plus, earlier this month, Microsoft announced an agentic tool in Windows 11 that helps end users manage settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/thumbnail.png?w=685" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A startup called Pig.dev that participated in Y Combinator’s Winter 2025 batch was working on a potentially revolutionary idea: AI agentic tech to control a Microsoft Windows desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But in May, the founder announced he was abandoning the tech and pivoting his company to something entirely different: Muscle Mem, a cache system for AI agents that allows them to offload repeatable tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An early-stage YC company pivoting is nothing out of the ordinary, of course. What’s interesting — and what sparked a dynamic conversation on Thursday’s Y Combinator podcast — is that Pig was working on computer use, one of the big areas that needs to be solved for agents to be truly useful in the workforce. Another company — and another YC alum — that is tackling that for the browser is called Browser Use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Browser Use surged to popularity when the Chinese agentic tool Manus, which relied on it, went viral. Browser Use essentially scans the buttons and elements of a website to turn them into a more digestible, “text-like” format for agents, helping the AI understand how to navigate and use the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During the Y Combinator podcast, released Thursday, partner Tom Blomfield likened Pig to the Browser Use for Windows desktops.&amp;nbsp;The podcast featured Amjad Masad, the founder and CEO of popular vibe-coding startup Replit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Masad, Blomfield, and YC partner David Lieb were discussing how long-term computer use of hours, rather than minutes, was still a stumbling block for agents. As the context window for reasoning grows, an agent’s accuracy wavers while LLM costs increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The advice I would give founders today is taking either Browser Use or Windows automation with Pig and trying to apply that into enterprise, into a vertical industry,” Blomfield suggested.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Masad agreed. “The moment that technology works, those two companies are going to do really, really well,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But alas, Pig’s founder Erik Dunteman has already given up on the idea. In his post in May, he explained that he at first wanted to run a cloud API product (a common way of delivering AI tech). But his customers didn’t want that. So he tried selling it as a dev tool. And they didn’t want that either.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What users in the legacy app automation space actually want is to hand me money, and receive an automation,” he said. Essentially, they wanted to hire a consultant to make their desired Windows robotic process automations work for them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Dunteman didn’t want to do one-off projects. He wanted to build development tools. So he abandoned Pig and started working on an AI caching tool. Dunteman declined further comment about his decision to ditch Windows automation, although the Pig.dev website and GitHub documents remain available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Dunteman did tell us his new tool was inspired by the computer use problem. It is chipping away at it from another angle. The idea is to allow the agent to offload repeated tasks to the Muscle Mem service so the agent can focus on reasoning for new problems and edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What we’re working on now is directly inspired by and applicable to computer use, just at the developer tooling layer. I remain very optimistic for computer use as ‘the last mile,’” he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s not to say that no one is working on Windows automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Probably the company furthest along on that is Microsoft. For instance, in April, Microsoft announced it added computer use tech to Copilot Studio for graphical user interfaces like Windows. That tech was released as a research preview.&amp;nbsp; Plus, earlier this month, Microsoft announced an agentic tool in Windows 11 that helps end users manage settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/why-a-y-combinator-startup-tackling-ai-agents-for-windows-gave-up-and-pivoted/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 22:33:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Benchmark in talks to lead Series A for Greptile, valuing AI-code reviewer at $180M, sources say (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/benchmark-in-talks-to-lead-series-a-for-greptile-valuing-ai-code-reviewer-at-180m-sources-say/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1388336038.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Greptile, an AI-powered code review startup, is in the process of raising a Series A. Sources familiar with the deal tell TechCrunch it’s for $30 million at a $180 million valuation led by Benchmark partner Eric Vishria. But one person says that the deal hasn’t closed and terms may change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded by Dasksh Gupta after he graduated from Georgia Tech in 2023, the startup went through Y Combinator in the winter of 2024 cohort, and raised a $4 million seed round led by Initialized Capital after completing its program.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gupta told TechCrunch last year that the bot his company developed acts as an experienced coworker, possessing a deep understanding of the customer’s code, which enables it to pinpoint bugs and other potential issues that human reviewers might miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As with most areas of AI, the code review space is very competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Greptile’s most prominent rivals include Graphite, a startup that earlier this year raised a $52 million Series B led by Accel with participation from Anthropic’s Anthology Fund with Menlo Ventures, a16z, and others. Another key competitor is Coderabbit, which last year secured a $16 million Series A from CRV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The intense competition has driven Greptile to require its staff to work exceptionally long hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The then 22-year-old Gupta posted on X in November that Greptile “offers no work-life-balance.” Employees typically work from 9 am until 11 pm, including Saturdays, and sometimes Sundays, he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After the post went viral, Gupta told multiple news outlets that outperforming the competition demands maximum effort from every team member. “No one cares about the third-best company, or even the second-best company in any category in software. If you’re going to put in 95 percent effort, it’s the equivalent of putting in 0 percent effort,” Gupta said in an interview with Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whatever the work culture, attracting an A-list VC like Benchmark at a healthy Series A valuation, could also be helpful in Greptile’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Greptile and Benchmark did not respond to a request for comment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1388336038.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Greptile, an AI-powered code review startup, is in the process of raising a Series A.

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has officially moved its new, high-performance Gemini Embedding model to general availability, currently ranking number one overall on the highly regarded Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The model (gemini-embedding-001) is now a core part of the Gemini API and Vertex AI, enabling developers to build applications such as semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While a number-one ranking is a strong debut, the landscape of embedding models is very competitive. Google’s proprietary model is being challenged directly by powerful open-source alternatives. This sets up a new strategic choice for enterprises: adopt the top-ranked proprietary model or a nearly-as-good open-source challenger that offers more control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-under-the-hood-of-google-s-gemini-embedding-model"&gt;What’s under the hood of Google’s Gemini embedding model&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At their core, embeddings convert text (or other data types) into numerical lists that capture the key features of the input. Data with similar semantic meaning have embedding values that are closer together in this numerical space. This allows for powerful applications that go far beyond simple keyword matching, such as building intelligent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that feed relevant information to LLMs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embeddings can also be applied to other modalities such as images, video and audio. For instance, an e-commerce company might utilize a multimodal embedding model to generate a unified numerical representation for a product that incorporates both textual descriptions and images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, embedding models can power more accurate internal search engines, sophisticated document clustering, classification tasks, sentiment analysis and anomaly detection. Embeddings are also becoming an important part of agentic applications, where AI agents must retrieve and match different types of documents and prompts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of Gemini Embedding is its built-in flexibility. It has been trained through a technique known as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), which allows developers to get a highly detailed 3072-dimension embedding but also truncate it to smaller sizes like 1536 or 768 while preserving its most relevant features. This flexibility enables an enterprise to strike a balance between model accuracy, performance and storage costs, which is crucial for scaling applications efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google positions Gemini Embedding as a unified model designed to work effectively “out-of-the-box” across diverse domains like finance, legal and engineering without the need for fine-tuning. This simplifies development for teams that need a general-purpose solution. Supporting over 100 languages and priced competitively at $0.15 per million input tokens, it is designed for broad accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-competitive-landscape-of-proprietary-and-open-source-challengers"&gt;A competitive landscape of proprietary and open-source challengers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="MTEB rankings" class="wp-image-3014381" height="450" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image_7cf7a0.png?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Google Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MTEB leaderboard shows that while Gemini leads, the gap is narrow. It faces established models from OpenAI, whose embedding models are widely used, and specialized challengers like Mistral, which offers a model specifically for code retrieval. The emergence of these specialized models suggests that for certain tasks, a targeted tool may outperform a generalist one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key player, Cohere, targets the enterprise directly with its Embed 4 model. While other models compete on general benchmarks, Cohere emphasizes its model’s ability to handle the “noisy real-world data” often found in enterprise documents, such as spelling mistakes, formatting issues, and even scanned handwriting. It also offers deployment on virtual private clouds or on-premises, providing a level of data security that directly appeals to regulated industries such as finance and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most direct threat to proprietary dominance comes from the open-source community. Alibaba’s Qwen3-Embedding model ranks just behind Gemini on MTEB and is available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license (available for commercial purposes). For enterprises focused on software development, Qodo’s Qodo-Embed-1-1.5B presents another compelling open-source alternative, designed specifically for code and claiming to outperform larger models on domain-specific benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For companies already building on Google Cloud and the Gemini family of models, adopting the native embedding model can have several benefits, including seamless integration, a simplified MLOps pipeline, and the assurance of using a top-ranked general-purpose model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Gemini is a closed, API-only model. Enterprises that prioritize data sovereignty, cost control, or the ability to run models on their own infrastructure now have a credible, top-tier open-source option in Qwen3-Embedding or can use one of the task-specific embedding models.&lt;/p&gt;
