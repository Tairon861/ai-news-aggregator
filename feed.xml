&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is one of the most aggressive moves so far from government officials responding to a flood of sexualized, AI-generated imagery — often depicting real women and minors, and sometimes showing assault and abuse — posted by Grok in response to requests from users on the social network X. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement shared with the Guardian and other publications, Indonesia’s communications and digital minister Meutya Hafid said, “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ministry has also reportedly summoned X officials to discuss the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Varied governmental responses over the past week include an order from India’s IT ministry for xAI to take action to prevent Grok from generating obscene content, as well as an order from the European Commission for the company to retain all documents related to Grok, which could be setting the stage for an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the United Kingdom, the communications regulator Ofcom has said that it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview Ofcom has his “full support to take action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And while in the United States, the Trump administration appears to be staying silent on the issue (xAI CEO Elon Musk is a major Trump donor and led the administration’s controversial Department of Government Efficiency last year), Democratic senators have called on Apple and Google to remove X from their app stores.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI initially responded by posting a seemingly first-person apology to the Grok account, acknowledging that a post “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” around child sexual abuse material. It later restricted the AI image-generation feature to paying subscribers on X, though that restriction did not appear to affect the Grok app itself, which still allowed anyone to generate images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to a post wondering why the U.K. government wasn’t taking action against other AI image generation tools, Musk wrote, “They want any excuse for censorship.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2223576505.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Indonesian officials said Saturday that they are temporarily blocking access to xAI’s chatbot Grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and training data company Handshake AI are asking third-party contractors to upload real work that they did in past and current jobs, according to a report in Wired.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This appears to be part of a larger strategy across AI companies that are hiring contractors to generate high-quality training data in the hopes that this will eventually allow their models to automate more white-collar work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In OpenAI’s case, a company presentation reportedly asks contractors to describe tasks they’ve performed at other jobs and upload examples of “real, on-the-job work” that they’ve “&lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; done.” These examples can include “a concrete output (not a summary of the file, but the actual file), e.g., Word doc, PDF, Powerpoint, Excel, image, repo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company reportedly instructs contractors to delete proprietary and personally identifiable information before uploading, and it points them to a ChatGPT “Superstar Scrubbing” tool to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nonetheless, intellectual property lawyer Evan Brown told Wired that any AI lab taking this approach is “putting itself at great risk” with an approach that requires “a lot of trust in its contractors to decide what is and isn’t confidential.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An OpenAI spokesperson declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
