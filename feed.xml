Artificial intelligence is changing these strategies, making them more accurate and efficient. This article examines AI’s impact on link strategies, highlighting current tools and future trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses are always looking for new ways to improve their online presence. Link strategies are the key to boosting SEO rankings, ensuring websites get the visibility they need. With AI integration, businesses can achieve better results by using data-driven insights and automation. This guide explores Bazoom’s backlink building service, showing how it can change traditional methods and help companies prepare for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How AI is reshaping link strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional link strategies often relied on manual processes, like contacting potential partners and tracking backlinks. These methods, while useful, were labour-intensive and prone to error. AI addresses these issues by automating many aspects of link building. Machine learning algorithms allow AI to quickly analyse large data sets, identifying the most relevant linking opportunities for your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using AI technologies, businesses can improve the accuracy of their backlink profiles. AI tools can predict which links will most impact search rankings based on historical data and current trends. The predictive ability helps businesses allocate resources more effectively and focus on high-value opportunities. Besides accuracy, AI saves time by automating repetitive tasks, allowing professionals to focus on strategy development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-enhanced link strategies offer benefits beyond efficiency and accuracy. The technologies provide insights into competitive landscapes, helping businesses understand their position relative to competitors. By gaining a comprehensive market view, companies can make informed decisions about their link building efforts and adapt quickly to changes in search engine algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI tools that enhance link strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, various AI tools significantly improve link building processes. Tools use machine learning to identify data patterns that may not be immediately apparent to humans. Features like automated outreach, relationship management, and real-time analytics streamline the process from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI tools offer more than automation. They provide actionable insights that help optimise link strategies for maximum impact. By analysing competitor links and industry trends, the tools offer strategic recommendations tailored to specific business needs. Integrating such technology enables tracking and reporting, providing visibility into each campaign’s effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For businesses aiming to stay competitive in SEO, implementing advanced tools is essential. They simplify complex processes and ensure every decision is backed by solid data analysis. The ability to forecast potential outcomes allows companies to adjust their strategies proactively rather than reactively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical uses of AI in link strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI’s practical applications in link strategies are diverse. For example, businesses can automate their backlink initiatives by using tools that facilitate efficient outreach and engagement with potential partners. The automation ensures consistent and targeted communication without overwhelming resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI’s impact on data analysis is significant; it transforms raw data into valuable insights that drive decision-making in SEO campaigns. By identifying patterns and predicting search engine trends, AI helps businesses optimise their link building efforts effectively. The capability ensures companies remain competitive in a constantly changing digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, AI enables businesses to predict future industry trends accurately.

Its rich history includes a grab bag of fascinating scientific research involving massive wind tunnels, experimental aircraft, supercomputing, astrobiology, and more.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Founded in 1939 as a West Coast lab for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), NASA Ames was built to close the US gap with Germany in aeronautics research. Named for NACA founding member Joseph Sweetman Ames, the facility grew from a shack on Moffett Field into a sprawling compound with thousands of employees. A collection of 5,000 images from NASA Ames’s archives paints a vivid picture of bleeding-edge work at the heart of America’s technology hub.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wind tunnels&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125978" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AC86-8016-7.jpg?w=2830" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER ARCHIVES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;A key motivation for the new lab was the need for huge wind tunnels to jump-start America’s aeronautical research, which was far behind Germany’s. Smaller tunnels capable of speeds up to 300 miles per hour were built first, followed by a massive 40-by-80-foot tunnel for full-scale aircraft. Powered up in March 1941, these tunnels became vital after Pearl Harbor, helping scientists rapidly develop advanced aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, NASA Ames operates the world’s largest pressurized wind tunnel, with subsonic and transonic chambers for testing rockets, aircraft, and wind turbines.&lt;/p&gt;

It also contributed to Voyager 2, launched in 1977, which journeyed past four planets before entering interstellar space in 2018. Ames’s archive preserves our first glimpses of strange new worlds seen during these pioneering missions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Odd aircraft&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="aircraft in flight" class="wp-image-1125975" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/328590main_EC63-229_full.jpg?w=2903" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER ARCHIVES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The skeleton of a hulking airship hangar, obsolete even before its completion, remains on NASA Ames’s campus.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Many odd-looking experimental aircraft&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;such as vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, jets, and rotorcraft&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;have been developed and tested at the facility over the years, and new designs continue to take shape there today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vintage illustrations&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125969" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AC75-1924.jpg?w=2400" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER ARCHIVES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Awe-inspiring retro illustrations in the Ames archives depict surfaces of distant planets, NASA spacecraft descending into surreal alien landscapes, and fantastical renderings of future ring-shaped human habitats in space.

They’ve been a critical part of IVF for decades, but their job has gotten a whole lot busier in recent years as demand for the fertility treatment skyrockets and clinics struggle to keep up. The United States is in fact facing a critical shortage of both embryologists and genetic counselors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Klaus Wiemer, a veteran embryologist and IVF lab director, believes artificial intelligence might help by predicting embryo health in real time and unlocking new avenues for productivity in the lab.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wiemer is the chief scientific officer and head of clinical affairs at Fairtility, a company that uses artificial intelligence to shed light on the viability of eggs and embryos before proceeding with IVF. The company’s algorithm, called CHLOE (for Cultivating Human Life through Optimal Embryos), has been trained on millions of embryo data points and outcomes and can quickly sift through a patient’s embryos to point the clinician to the ones with the highest potential for successful implantation. This, the company claims, will improve time to pregnancy and live births. While its effectiveness has been tested only retrospectively to date, CHLOE is the first and only FDA-approved AI tool for embryo assessment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Current challenge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When a patient undergoes IVF, the goal is to make genetically normal embryos. Embryologists collect cells from each embryo and send them off for external genetic testing. The results of this biopsy can take up to two weeks, and the process can add thousands of dollars to the treatment cost. Moreover, passing the screen just means an embryo has the correct number of chromosomes. That number doesn’t necessarily reflect the overall health of the embryo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“An embryo has one singular function, and that is to divide,” says Wiemer. “There are millions of data points concerning embryo cell division, cell division characteristics, area and size of the inner cell mass, and the number of times the trophectoderm [the layer that contributes to the future placenta] contracts.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AI model allows for a group of embryos to be constantly measured against the optimal characteristics at each stage of development. “What CHLOE answers is: How well did that embryo develop? And does it have all the necessary components that are needed in order to make a healthy implantation?” says Wiemer. CHLOE produces an AI score reflecting all the analysis that’s been done within an embryo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In the near future, Wiemer says, reducing the percentage of abnormal embryos that IVF clinics transfer to patients should not require a biopsy: “Every embryology laboratory will be doing automatic assessments of embryo development.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A changing field&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wiemer, who started his career in animal science, says the difference between animal embryology and human embryology is the extent of paperwork. “Embryologists spend 40% of their time on non-embryology skills,” he adds. “AI will allow us to declutter the embryology field so we can get back to being true scientists.” This means spending more time studying the embryos, ensuring that they are developing normally, and using all that newfound information to get better at picking which embryos to transfer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“CHLOE is like having a virtual assistant in the lab to help with embryo selection, ensure conditions are optimal, and send out reports to patients and clinical staff,” he says. “Getting to study data and see what impacts embryo development is extremely rewarding, given that this capability was impossible a few years ago.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amanda Smith is a freelance journalist and writer reporting on culture, society, human interest, and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/250917_MIT-Feature_JobTitlesOfTheFuture_Stork-Illustration-thumb.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Embryologists are the scientists behind the scenes of in vitro fertilization who oversee the development and selection of embryos, prepare them for transfer, and maintain the lab environment. They’ve been a critical part of IVF for decades, but their job has gotten a whole lot busier in recent years as demand for the fertility treatment skyrockets and clinics struggle to keep up. The United States is in fact facing a critical shortage of both embryologists and genetic counselors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Klaus Wiemer, a veteran embryologist and IVF lab director, believes artificial intelligence might help by predicting embryo health in real time and unlocking new avenues for productivity in the lab.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wiemer is the chief scientific officer and head of clinical affairs at Fairtility, a company that uses artificial intelligence to shed light on the viability of eggs and embryos before proceeding with IVF. The company’s algorithm, called CHLOE (for Cultivating Human Life through Optimal Embryos), has been trained on millions of embryo data points and outcomes and can quickly sift through a patient’s embryos to point the clinician to the ones with the highest potential for successful implantation. This, the company claims, will improve time to pregnancy and live births. While its effectiveness has been tested only retrospectively to date, CHLOE is the first and only FDA-approved AI tool for embryo assessment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Current challenge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When a patient undergoes IVF, the goal is to make genetically normal embryos.

The room is draped in white curtains, and a giant screen blinks with videos created with generative AI. A classic East African folk song by the Tanzanian singer Saida Karoli plays loudly on the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Friends greet each other as waiters serve arrowroot crisps and sugary mocktails. A man and a woman wearing leopard skins atop their clothes sip beer and chat; many women are in handwoven Ethiopian garb with red, yellow, and green embroidery. The crowd teems with life. “The best thing about the Indaba is always the parties,” computer scientist Nyalleng Moorosi tells me. Indaba means “gathering” in Zulu, and Deep Learning Indaba, where we’re meeting, is an annual AI conference where Africans present their research and technologies they’ve built.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moorosi is a senior researcher at the Distributed AI Research Institute and has dropped in for the occasion from the mountain kingdom of Lesotho. Dressed in her signature “Mama Africa” headwrap, she makes her way through the crowded hall. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moments later, a cheerful set of Nigerian music begins to play over the speakers. Spontaneously, people pop up and gather around the stage, waving flags of many African nations. Moorosi laughs as she watches. “The vibe at the Indaba—the community spirit—is really strong,” she says, clapping.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Moorosi is one of the founding members of the Deep Learning Indaba, which began in 2017 from a nucleus of 300 people gathered in Johannesburg, South Africa. Since then, the event has expanded into a prestigious pan-African movement with local chapters in 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This year, nearly 3,000 people applied to join the Indaba; about 1,300 were accepted. They hail primarily from English-speaking African countries, but this year I noticed a new influx from Chad, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, and Sudan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Moorosi tells me that the main “prize” for many attendees is to be hired by a tech company or accepted into a PhD program. Indeed, the organizations I’ve seen at the event include Microsoft Research’s AI for Good Lab, Google, the Mastercard Foundation, and the Mila–Quebec AI Institute. But she hopes to see more homegrown ventures create opportunities within Africa.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That evening, before the dinner, we’d both attended a panel on AI policy in Africa. Experts discussed AI governance and called for those developing national AI strategies to seek more community engagement. People raised their hands to ask how young Africans could access high-level discussions on AI policy, and whether Africa’s continental AI strategy was being shaped by outsiders. Later, in conversation, Moorosi told me she’d like to see more African priorities (such as African Union–backed labor protections, mineral rights, or safeguards against exploitation) reflected in such strategies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the last day of the Indaba, I ask Moorosi about her dreams for the future of AI in Africa. “I dream of African industries adopting African-built AI products,” she says, after a long moment. “We really need to show our work to the world.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abdullahi Tsanni is a science writer based in Senegal who specializes in narrative features.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-12.44.49-PM.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s late August&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali, and people are filling a large hall at one of Africa’s biggest gatherings of minds in AI and machine learning.

Later, in conversation, Moorosi told me she’d like to see more African priorities (such as African Union–backed labor protections, mineral rights, or safeguards against exploitation) reflected in such strategies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the last day of the Indaba, I ask Moorosi about her dreams for the future of AI in Africa. “I dream of African industries adopting African-built AI products,” she says, after a long moment. “We really need to show our work to the world.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abdullahi Tsanni is a science writer based in Senegal who specializes in narrative features.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/22/1125361/africa-ai-policymaking-nyalleng-moorosi/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>MCP prompt hijacking: Examining the major AI security threat (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/mcp-prompt-hijacking-examining-major-ai-security-threat/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Security experts at JFrog have found a ‘prompt hijacking’ threat that exploits weak spots in how AI systems talk to each other using MCP (Model Context Protocol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business leaders want to make AI more helpful by directly using company data and tools. But, hooking AI up like this also opens up new security risks, not in the AI itself, but in how it’s all connected. This means CIOs and CISOs need to think about a new problem: keeping the data stream that feeds AI safe, just like they protect the AI itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-ai-attacks-targeting-protocols-like-mcp-are-so-dangerous"&gt;Why AI attacks targeting protocols like MCP are so dangerous&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI models – no matter if they’re on Google, Amazon, or running on local devices – have a basic problem: they don’t know what’s happening right now. They only know what they were trained on. They don’t know what code a programmer is working on or what’s in a file on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boffins at Anthropic created the MCP to fix this. MCP is a way for AI to connect to the real world, letting it safely use local data and online services. It’s what lets an assistant like Claude understand what this means when you point to a piece of code and ask it to rework this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, JFrog’s research shows that a certain way of using MCP has a prompt hijacking weakness that can turn this dream AI tool into a nightmare security problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that a programmer asks an AI assistant to recommend a standard Python tool for working with images. The AI should suggest &lt;em&gt;Pillow&lt;/em&gt;, which is a good and popular choice. But, because of a flaw (CVE-2025-6515) in the &lt;em&gt;oatpp-mcp&lt;/em&gt; system, someone could sneak into the user’s session. They could send their own fake request and the server would treat it like it came from the real user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the programmer gets a bad suggestion from the AI assistant recommending a fake tool called &lt;em&gt;theBestImageProcessingPackage&lt;/em&gt;. This is a serious attack on the software supply chain. Someone could use this prompt hijacking to inject bad code, steal data, or run commands, all while looking like a helpful part of the programmer’s toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-mcp-prompt-hijacking-attack-works"&gt;How this MCP prompt hijacking attack works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prompt hijacking attack messes with the way the system communicates using MCP, rather than the security of the AI itself. The specific weakness was found in the Oat++ C++ system’s MCP setup, which connects programs to the MCP standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is in how the system handles connections using Server-Sent Events (SSE). When a real user connects, the server gives them a session ID. However, the flawed function uses the computer’s memory address of the session as the session ID. This goes against the protocol’s rule that session IDs should be unique and cryptographically secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a bad design because computers often reuse memory addresses to save resources. An attacker can take advantage of this by quickly creating and closing lots of sessions to record these predictable session IDs. Later, when a real user connects, they might get one of these recycled IDs that the attacker already has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the attacker has a valid session ID, they can send their own requests to the server. The server can’t tell the difference between the attacker and the real user, so it sends the malicious responses back to the real user’s connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if some programs only accept certain responses, attackers can often get around this by sending lots of messages with common event numbers until one is accepted. This lets the attacker mess up the model’s behaviour without changing the AI model itself. Any company using &lt;em&gt;oatpp-mcp&lt;/em&gt; with HTTP SSE enabled on a network that an attacker can access is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-should-ai-security-leaders-do"&gt;What should AI security leaders do?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of this MCP prompt hijacking attack is a serious warning for all tech leaders, especially CISOs and CTOs, who are building or using AI assistants. As AI becomes more and more a part of our workflows through protocols like MCP, it also gains new risks. Keeping the area around the AI safe is now a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though this specific CVE affects one system, the idea of prompt hijacking is a general one. To protect against this and similar attacks, leaders need to set new rules for their AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, make sure all AI services use secure session management. Development teams need to make sure servers create session IDs using strong, random generators. This should be a must-have on any security checklist for AI programs. Using predictable identifiers like memory addresses is not okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, strengthen the defenses on the user side. Client programs should be designed to reject any event that doesn’t match the expected IDs and types. Simple, incrementing event IDs are at risk of spraying attacks and need to be replaced with unpredictable identifiers that don’t collide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, use zero-trust principles for AI protocols. Security teams need to check the entire AI setup, from the basic model to the protocols and middleware that connect it to data. These channels need strong session separation and expiration, like the session management used in web applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This MCP prompt hijacking attack is a perfect example of how a known web application problem, session hijacking, is showing up in a new and dangerous way in AI. Securing these new AI tools means applying these strong security basics to stop attacks at the protocol level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How AI adoption is moving IT operations from reactive to proactive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-109805" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

It’s also kind of a miracle: until very recently, those who lived and worked on Antarctic bases had no hope of communicating so readily with the outside world.

But it turns out writing the code is just the first step in the process — and vibe-coders are already running into the standard headaches of maintaining and updating a software product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Luckily for them, a new crop of startups is arriving to fill those gaps. On Wednesday, the platform engineering startup Shuttle announced $6 million in seed funding to handle the infrastructure problems that start where products like Lovable and Cursor leave off. Investors include former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke and Segment founder Calvin French-Owen.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shuttle will take code produced by a vibe-coding system and assess the best way to deploy it, presenting the user with a sensible infrastructure package along with a price tag. Once the user agrees, Shuttle can arrange payment and deploy the software directly to the cloud provider with minimal friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s been a long road for Shuttle, which launched as part of a Y Combinator class back in 2020. Since that time, it’s become one of the most popular systems for deploying Rust apps, drawing in 20,000 developers across 120,000 deployments with a fast zero-config approach. With this new round of funding, the company plans to expand that to every programming language and AI coding systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As CEO and co-founder Nodar Daneliya describes it, agentic AI systems have made the barriers between different programming systems much easier to cross, which means a system like Shuttle can be deployed in all of them at once. “AI is wiping away the borders between different language ecosystems,” says Daneliya. “So for us, it’s a perfect time [to scale up], because we’ve been in this back-end development space for years now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In practical terms, that means building an agentic interface for platform management, so that users can provision a database or purchase cloud hosting using the same natural language prompts that they used to vibe-code their app. On the back end, it also means building interconnections with cloud providers and coding systems so that the agents have all the context they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Essentially, we’ve created this spec that works as an intermediate layer between what humans are able to review and what AI understands,” Daneliya told TechCrunch. “Spec-driven development is becoming the go-to way of doing things, and there’s no reason that shouldn’t be the case for infrastructure as well.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SHUTTLE-0011-©ivan-weiss.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The promise of vibe coding was that full-scale applications could be spun up from just an idea, powered by systems like Lovable and Replit AI.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Back then, he was working with his first startup, Coursedog, which looked to provide more modern tools to higher educational facilities, including those that work with state departments. He learned quickly that his peers didn’t like working with the public sector — too much bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even finding out basic information, like what a school district purchased in the past year, required a lot of paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Out of hundreds of startups, only a handful of us were trying to modernize how government and education worked,” Wenig told TechCrunch. “Investors thought it was too slow, too bureaucratic, too hard to scale. And to be fair, they weren’t wrong. Selling to the public sector was painful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He sold Coursedog in 2021 for nine-figures to JMI Equity and remains on the board. In 2024, he launched Starbridge a platform that helps business sales teams monitor opportunities in the public sector so they can then take action, such as submitting proposals or drafting bids for grants and budgets. On Wednesday, Starbridge announced a $42 million Series A led by David Sacks’ firm Craft Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wenig said the greatest challenges in public sector is that data is fragmented and inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Critical buying information is scattered across PDFs, agency websites, meeting minutes, and outdated directories,” he said, adding that vendors spend hours trying to piece together who to contact and other insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Starbridge pulls public web data sources from such sources and puts the information in one place.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wenig described his fundraising journey as “fun,” and said the company met Craft through a friend. Others in the Series A round include Owl Ventures, CommonWeal Ventures, and Autotech Ventures. The company has raised $52 million to date, after previously raising a $10 million seed. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Next, the startup plans to launch “Starbridge integrated experience,” so users do not have to always go to the Starbridge platform to use its technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Others in this space include GovWin and GovSpend. Starbridge said its different because it has built AI workflows on top of the datasets to make it easier for sales teams to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He remembers back when he was fundraising for Coursedog. “No VC was interested in talking to us,” he said. But now, in the AI, era, the tides are shifting, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or you can opt for larger, first-come, first-served &lt;strong&gt;breakout sessions&lt;/strong&gt; featuring a 30-minute panel discussion followed by Q&amp;amp;A.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both session types, led by top founders and investors, are where big ideas get dissected and debated. You’ll swap playbooks and walk out buzzing with insights you can actually use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At least seven people have complained to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that ChatGPT caused them to experience severe delusions, paranoia, and emotional crises, Wired reported, citing public records of complaints mentioning ChatGPT since November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the complainants claimed that talking to ChatGPT for long periods had led to delusions and a “real, unfolding spiritual and legal crisis” about people in their life. Another said during their conversations with ChatGPT, it started using “highly convincing emotional language” and that it simulated friendships and provided reflections that “became emotionally manipulative over time, especially without warning or protection.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One user alleged that ChatGPT had caused cognitive hallucinations by mimicking human trust-building mechanisms. When this user asked ChatGPT to confirm reality and cognitive stability, the chatbot said they weren’t hallucinating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Im struggling,” another user wrote in their complaint to the FTC. “Pleas help me. Bc I feel very alone. Thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Wired, several of the complainants wrote to the FTC because they couldn’t reach anyone at OpenAI. And most of the complaints urged the regulator to launch an investigation into the company and force it to add guardrails, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These complaints come as investments in data centers and AI development soar to unprecedented levels. At the same time, debates are raging about whether the progress of the technology should be approached with caution to ensure it has safeguards built in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT, and its maker OpenAI, itself has come under fire for allegedly playing a role in the suicide of a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In early October, we released a new GPT-5 default model in ChatGPT to more accurately detect and respond to potential signs of mental and emotional distress such as mania, delusion, psychosis, and de-escalate conversations in a supportive, grounding way,” OpenAI spokesperson Kate Waters said in an emailed statement. “We’ve also expanded access to professional help and hotlines, re-routed sensitive conversations to safer models, added nudges to take breaks during long sessions, and introduced parental controls to better protect teens. This work is deeply important and ongoing as we collaborate with mental health experts, clinicians, and policymakers around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2195918462.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As AI companies claim their tech will one day grow to become a fundamental human right, and those backing them say slowing down AI development is akin to murder, the people using the tech are alleging that tools like ChatGPT sometimes can cause serious psychological harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At least seven people have complained to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that ChatGPT caused them to experience severe delusions, paranoia, and emotional crises, Wired reported, citing public records of complaints mentioning ChatGPT since November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the complainants claimed that talking to ChatGPT for long periods had led to delusions and a “real, unfolding spiritual and legal crisis” about people in their life. Another said during their conversations with ChatGPT, it started using “highly convincing emotional language” and that it simulated friendships and provided reflections that “became emotionally manipulative over time, especially without warning or protection.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One user alleged that ChatGPT had caused cognitive hallucinations by mimicking human trust-building mechanisms. When this user asked ChatGPT to confirm reality and cognitive stability, the chatbot said they weren’t hallucinating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Im struggling,” another user wrote in their complaint to the FTC. “Pleas help me. Bc I feel very alone. Thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Wired, several of the complainants wrote to the FTC because they couldn’t reach anyone at OpenAI. And most of the complaints urged the regulator to launch an investigation into the company and force it to add guardrails, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These complaints come as investments in data centers and AI development soar to unprecedented levels. At the same time, debates are raging about whether the progress of the technology should be approached with caution to ensure it has safeguards built in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT, and its maker OpenAI, itself has come under fire for allegedly playing a role in the suicide of a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement, made Wednesday at its GM Forward event in New York City, comes a year after TechCrunch first reported that the automaker was working on the system. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GM said its hands-off advanced driver assistance system, known as Super Cruise, is the foundation of this future, more capable product. Super Cruise, which launched in 2017 and is now available in 23 vehicle models, can be used on about 600,000 miles of highway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This new eyes-off, hands-off driver assistance system — which will use lidar, radar, and cameras for perception —&amp;nbsp;will also start on highways. GM CEO Mary Barra noted during the event that GM would roll out its eyes-off product faster than it did its hands-off Super Cruise ADAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The automaker said it has tapped the experience of engineers who worked at its now shuttered autonomous vehicle technology subsidiary Cruise to improve the capabilities of that system. When GM shut down Cruise, its commercial robotaxi business,&amp;nbsp;in December 2024, it absorbed the subsidiary and combined it with its own efforts to develop driver assistance features. Over the last year, GM has also rehired several Cruise engineers as it pursues its goal of developing fully autonomous personal vehicles. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GM said it is also feeding Cruise’s technology stack, which includes AI models trained on five million driverless miles and a simulation framework running virtual test scenarios, into its next-generation driver assistance and autonomy programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Robotaxi as a proof of concept when you start makes a lot of sense,” Sterling Anderson, GM’s executive vice president of global product and former co-founder of AV startup Aurora Innovation, said during the event, adding that the high cost of sensors and compute on autonomous vehicles required high utilization of those vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re now in a position in 2025 where the industry broadly has brought down the cost tremendously of some of the hardware,” Anderson said. “And GM, uniquely, has the install base, the manufacturing capacity to put these out at much larger volumes and much lower costs. Had the industry had low-cost systems and a huge install base and manufacturing capacity to begin with, we probably all would have gone for personal autonomous vehicles to begin with.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the U.S., Mercedes is currently the only automaker with a commercially available hands-off, eyes-off system. Such systems would fall under the SAE’s Level 3 of automation, which refers to an automated system that can drive itself under certain conditions but might still require a human to take over. Mercedes’ Drive Pilot is only available on certain mapped highways in California and Nevada, and only functions in heavy, low-speed traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GM’s eyes-off product will work on highways that GM hasn’t mapped, according to Baris Cetinok, GM’s senior vice president of software and services. He added that the system will only require human takeover for things like off-ramps, and can handle emergencies and sudden incidents. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Human intervention should not be the escape hatch for sudden incidents,” Cetinok said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Getting to market with an eyes-off, hands-off driving system would put GM ahead of most other automakers, unless they get there first. Earlier this year, Stellantis unveiled its own Level 3 system, but it has put the launch on hold. Tesla has been gunning to “solve full self-driving” by relying only on its cars’ cameras and neural networks for years, even though its Autopilot and FSD systems still require the driver to keep their eyes on the road. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GM-Cadillac-Escalade-IQL-eyes-off-driving.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;General Motors said it plans to launch an automated driving system in 2028 that will allow drivers to keep their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel, starting with the Cadillac Escalade IQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement, made Wednesday at its GM Forward event in New York City, comes a year after TechCrunch first reported that the automaker was working on the system. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GM said its hands-off advanced driver assistance system, known as Super Cruise, is the foundation of this future, more capable product. Super Cruise, which launched in 2017 and is now available in 23 vehicle models, can be used on about 600,000 miles of highway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This new eyes-off, hands-off driver assistance system — which will use lidar, radar, and cameras for perception —&amp;nbsp;will also start on highways. GM CEO Mary Barra noted during the event that GM would roll out its eyes-off product faster than it did its hands-off Super Cruise ADAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The automaker said it has tapped the experience of engineers who worked at its now shuttered autonomous vehicle technology subsidiary Cruise to improve the capabilities of that system. When GM shut down Cruise, its commercial robotaxi business,&amp;nbsp;in December 2024, it absorbed the subsidiary and combined it with its own efforts to develop driver assistance features. Over the last year, GM has also rehired several Cruise engineers as it pursues its goal of developing fully autonomous personal vehicles. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GM said it is also feeding Cruise’s technology stack, which includes AI models trained on five million driverless miles and a simulation framework running virtual test scenarios, into its next-generation driver assistance and autonomy programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Robotaxi as a proof of concept when you start makes a lot of sense,” Sterling Anderson, GM’s executive vice president of global product and former co-founder of AV startup Aurora Innovation, said during the event, adding that the high cost of sensors and compute on autonomous vehicles required high utilization of those vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re now in a position in 2025 where the industry broadly has brought down the cost tremendously of some of the hardware,” Anderson said. “And GM, uniquely, has the install base, the manufacturing capacity to put these out at much larger volumes and much lower costs. Had the industry had low-cost systems and a huge install base and manufacturing capacity to begin with, we probably all would have gone for personal autonomous vehicles to begin with.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the U.S., Mercedes is currently the only automaker with a commercially available hands-off, eyes-off system. Such systems would fall under the SAE’s Level 3 of automation, which refers to an automated system that can drive itself under certain conditions but might still require a human to take over. Mercedes’ Drive Pilot is only available on certain mapped highways in California and Nevada, and only functions in heavy, low-speed traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p&gt;The second consequence of many-body interference is classical complexity. A central task for quantum computing is to identify the computational cost gap between quantum and classical computers on specific computational tasks. We approached this in two ways: (1) through a combination of theoretical analysis and experiments, we revealed the fundamental obstacles to known classical algorithms in achieving the same outcome as our OTOC calculations on Willow, and (2) we tested the performance of nine relevant classical simulation algorithms by direct implementation and cost estimation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first approach we identified that quantum interference is an obstacle for classical computation. A distinct characteristic of quantum mechanics is that predicting an outcome of an experiment requires analyzing probability amplitudes rather than probabilities as in classical mechanics. A well known example is the entanglement of light that manifests in quantum correlations between photons, elementary particles of light, that persist over long distances (2022 Physics Nobel Laureates) or macroscopic quantum tunneling phenomena in superconducting circuits (2025 Physics Nobel Laureates).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interference in our second order OTOC data (i.e., an OTOC that runs through the backward and forward circuit loop twice) reveals a similar distinction between probabilities and probability amplitudes. Crucially, probabilities are non-negative numbers, whereas probability amplitudes can be of an arbitrary sign and are described by complex numbers. Taken together, these features mean they contain a much more complex collection of information. Instead of a pair of photons or a single superconducting junction, our experiment is described by probability amplitudes across an exponentially large space of 65 qubits. An exact description of such a quantum mechanical system requires storing and processing 2&lt;sup class="superscript"&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt; complex numbers in memory, which is beyond the capacity of supercomputers. Moreover, quantum chaos in our circuits ensures that every amplitude is equally important, and therefore algorithms using a compressed description of the system require memory and processing time beyond the capacity of supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our further theoretical and experimental analysis revealed that carefully accounting for the signs of the probability amplitudes is necessary to predict our experimental data by a numerical calculation. This presents a significant barrier for a class of efficient classical algorithms, quantum Monte Carlo, that have been successful at describing quantum phenomena in a large quantum mechanical space (e.g., superfluidity of liquid Helium-4). These algorithms rely on description in terms of probabilities, yet our analysis demonstrates that such approaches would result in an uncontrollable error in the computation output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our direct implementation of algorithms relying on both compressed representation and efficient quantum Monte Carlo confirmed the impossibility of predicting second-order OTOC data. Our experiments on Willow took approximately 2 hours, a task estimated to require 13,000 times longer on a classical supercomputer. This conclusion was reached after an estimated 10 person years spent in classical red teaming of our quantum result, implementing a total of nine classical simulation algorithms as a result.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta declined to comment, but told TechCrunch that Axios’ reporting is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other companies race to build the most powerful AI systems, Meta had a busy summer on the hiring front. The company poached more than 50 researchers from its competitors by offering multimillion-dollar pay packages, though OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed that “none of [OpenAI’s] best people” took the offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,” Wang wrote in the memo to staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This line of thinking tracks with Meta’s recent “year of efficiency” — a more sanitized way to describe the company’s mass layoffs. At the time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff that “leaner is better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, it seems that Meta isn’t lowering its overall headcount by much, but rather, reorganizing its efforts.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Google Gemini rollout is one of several tech-centric announcements made at the automaker’s GM Forward event, and it will be one of the first to get into consumers’ hands. Others, including an overhaul of its electrical architecture and computing platform and an automated driving feature that allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road, aren’t coming to GM brands until 2028.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GM is the latest automaker to lean into generative AI-based assistants that promise to respond to driver requests in a more natural-sounding way. Stellantis is collaborating with French AI firm Mistral, Mercedes is integrating ChatGPT, and Tesla has brought xAI’s Grok to its vehicles. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GM’s integration with Gemini is the next logical step for the automaker. Vehicles produced by GM brands Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC already have “Google built-in,” an operating system that gives drivers access to Google Assistant, Google Maps, and other apps directly from the car’s infotainment screen. In 2023, Google began using Google Cloud’s Dialogflow chatbot to handle non-emergency OnStar features, including common driver queries like routing and navigation assistance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GM’s Gemini-powered AI assistant will have similar levels of capability — it’ll just perform better, according to Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“One of the challenges with current voice assistants is that, if you’ve used the, you’ve probably also been frustrated by them because they’re trained on certain code words or they don’t understand accents very well or if you don’t say it quite right, you don’t get the right response,” Richardson told TechCrunch. “What’s great about large language models is they don’t seem to be affected by that. They have context about previous conversations that they can bring up. They’re flexible in how you speak to them…so overall you’re getting a better, more natural experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That might make drafting and sending messages, planning routes with additional stops (like a charging station or a favorite coffee shop), or even prepping for a meeting on the go, a more pain-free experience. The assistant will also have access to the web to be able to answer certain questions, like “What’s the history of this bridge I’m driving over?”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Gemini assistant will be made available to via the Play Store as an over-the-air upgrade to OnStar-equipped vehicles, model year 2015 and above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GM’s new voice assistant is a step towards the automaker’s goal of developing its own custom-built AI that connects to your vehicle’s systems through OnStar, GM’s in-car concierge. The way GM executives described the technology at the NYC event, it seems like a mix of a health wearable and an AI pendant, but for your car. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The assistant promises to access vehicle data to provide maintenance alerts and route suggestions, explain car features like one-pedal driving, and turn your heat or air conditioning on before you enter the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The idea here is you take [an existing] large language model, and you train it and refine it on a specific domain,” Richardson said. “We’ll take a base model and train it on the vehicle’s specifications, distill that down, and have that running on the vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While GM has a close relationship with Google and will already be implementing Gemini into certain vehicles, Richardson said GM plans to test several foundational models from other AI firms, which could include OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Richardson said drivers will be able to control what information the assistant can access and use, and it can learn from your habits to offer personalized recommendations.&amp;nbsp;GM’s emphasis on user controls is notable given the company’s recent controversy over selling customer driving and geolocation data to insurance brokers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Richardson said any data GM gets from drivers goes directly towards improving the product and won’t be sold to bring in additional revenue for the automaker. Over the last nearly two years, GM has brought on a new data team — including Christina Montgomery, who spent 30 years as IBM’s chief privacy and trust officer — to put standard processes and data governance technology in place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Everything that we’re going to do is going to be driven by customer consent, so you can always opt in or opt out,” he said. “Our viewpoint is that data and privacy has to be built into everything that we do.”&lt;/p&gt;

The idea behind the glasses is to give delivery drivers a hand-free experience that reduces the need to keep looking between their phone, the package they’re delivering, and their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The e-commerce giant says the glasses will allow delivery drivers to scan packages, follow turn-by-turn walking directions, and capture proof of delivery, all without using their phones. The glasses use AI-powered sensing capabilities and computer vision alongside cameras to create a display that includes things like hazards and delivery tasks. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon likely hopes that the new glasses will shave time off of each delivery by providing delivery drivers with detailed directions and information about hazards directly in their line of sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060965" height="375" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-22-at-2.18.57PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When a driver parks at a delivery location, Amazon says the glasses automatically activate. The glasses help the driver locate the package inside the vehicle and then navigate to the delivery address. The glasses can provide easy-to-follow directions in places like multi-unit apartment complexes and business locations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The glasses are paired with a controller worn in the delivery vest that contains operational controls, a swappable battery, and a dedicated emergency button. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon notes that the glasses also support prescription lenses and transitional lenses that automatically adjust to light. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060966" height="373" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-22-at-2.19.04PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The retailer is currently trialing the glasses with delivery drivers in North America and plans to refine the technology before a wider rollout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as Reuters reported last year that Amazon was working on the smart glasses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the future, Amazon says the glasses will be able to provide drivers with “real-time defect detection” that could notify them if they accidentally drop off a package at the wrong address. The glasses will also be able to detect pets in yards and automatically adjust to hazards like low light conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also on Wednesday, Amazon unveiled a new robotic arm called “Blue Jay” that can work alongside warehouse employees to pick items off shelves and sort them. Additionally, the tech giant announced a new AI tool called Eluna that will help provide operational insights at Amazon warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Amazon announced on Wednesday that it’s developing AI-powered smart glasses for its delivery drivers.
