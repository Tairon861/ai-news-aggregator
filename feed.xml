&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google said students can take full-length mock exams for the JEE within Gemini, which will offer questions based on vetted content from Indian education firms Physics Wallah and Careers360.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch comes after the company recently rolled out similar test-prep tools for the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once students complete a mock test in Gemini, Google said the chatbot will provide immediate feedback, highlighting areas of strength and where further study is needed. It can also explain correct answers and help students generate a customized study plan based on their performance, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch of practice tests in Gemini signals a broader push to position the chatbot as a tool for structured exam preparation rather than a shortcut to answers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to Gemini, Google said the JEE Main preparation tools will roll out to AI Mode in Search, including the Canvas tool, which allows students to build study guides and interactive quizzes by attaching their class notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google claims Indian students are using Gemini to study subjects ranging from advanced physics to broader STEM topics, as well as using NotebookLM for turning study materials into quizzes, flash cards, and audio or video summaries. Google’s AI tools are available in multiple Indian languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google said it is also expanding its focus on Indian educators and plans to work with government agencies on a nationwide program to help teachers and support staff use AI for administrative work and lesson design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said it is partnering with the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and Chaudhary Charan Singh University on a pilot to build an “AI-enabled state university.” The project aims to create a national framework for applying AI across vocational and higher education, encompassing teaching and student support, as well as administrative operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the company said its charitable arm, Google.org, is backing Wadhwani AI with an ₹850 million (about $10 million) grant to integrate AI into government-run education platforms. The initiative targets systems such as national online learning portals and state education platforms, aiming to make them more adaptable and reduce administrative burdens for educators.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The program spans preschool through higher education, and includes tools such as voice-based reading support in multiple Indian languages and AI-powered English learning coaches. The company claims it has already reached around 10 million learners and educators and aims to scale to 75 million students, 1.8 million educators, and a million early-career professionals by the end of 2027.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jagmeet-singh-techcrunch.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google is expanding its push into AI-powered learning by adding full-length practice tests in Gemini for the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE), India’s nationwide engineering  exam used to shortlist candidates for the country’s top technical institutes and taken by millions of students each year.&lt;/p&gt;

Can the data be used at all? Where is it allowed to be stored? Who is responsible once the system goes live? At Standard Chartered, these privacy-driven questions now shape how AI systems are built,  and deployed at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For global banks operating in many jurisdictions, these early decisions are rarely straightforward. Privacy rules differ by market, and the same AI system may face very different constraints depending on where it is deployed. At Standard Chartered, this has pushed privacy teams into a more active role in shaping how AI systems are designed, approved, and monitored in the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Data privacy functions have become the starting point of most AI regulations,” says David Hardoon, Global Head of AI Enablement at Standard Chartered. In practice, that means privacy requirements shape the type of data that can be used in AI systems, how transparent those systems need to be, and how they are monitored once they are live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Privacy shaping how AI runs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is already running AI systems in live environments. The transition from pilots brings practical challenges that are easy to underestimate early on. In small trials, data sources are limited and well understood. In production, AI systems often pull data from many upstream platforms, each with its own structure and quality issues. “When moving from a contained pilot into live operations, ensuring data quality becomes more challenging with multiple upstream systems and potential schema differences,” Hardoon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111851" height="2445" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/David-Hardoon_Standard-Chartered-edited.jpg" width="1630" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;David Hardoon, Global Head of AI Enablement at Standard Chartered&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privacy rules add further constraints. In some cases, real customer data cannot be used to train models. Instead, teams may rely on anonymised data, which can affect how quickly systems are developed or how well they perform. Live deployments also operate at a much larger scale, increasing the impact of any gaps in controls. As Hardoon puts it, “As part of responsible and client-centric AI adoption, we prioritise adhering to principles of fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency as data processing scope expands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Geography and regulation decide where AI works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where AI systems are built and deployed is also shaped by geography. Data protection laws vary in regions, and some countries impose strict rules on where data must be stored and who can access it. These requirements play a direct role in how Standard Chartered deploys AI, particularly for systems that rely on client or personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Data sovereignty is often a key consideration when operating in different markets and regions,” Hardoon says. In markets with data localisation rules, AI systems may need to be deployed locally, or designed so that sensitive data does not cross borders. In other cases, shared platforms can be used, provided the right controls are in place. This results in a mix of global and market-specific AI deployments, shaped by local regulation not a single technical preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same trade-offs appear in decisions about centralised AI platforms versus local solutions. Large organisations often aim to share models, tools, and oversight in markets to reduce duplication. Privacy laws do not always block this approach. “In general, privacy regulations do not explicitly prohibit transfer of data, but rather expect appropriate controls to be in place,” Hardoon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are limits: some data cannot move in borders at all, and certain privacy laws apply beyond the country where data was collected. The details can restrict which markets a central platform can serve and where local systems remain necessary. For banks, this often leads to a layered setup, with shared foundations combined with localised AI use cases where regulation demands it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Human oversight remains central&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI becomes more embedded in decision-making, questions around explainability and consent grow harder to avoid. Automation may speed up processes, but it does not remove responsibility. “Transparency and explainability have become more crucial than before,” Hardoon says. Even when working with external vendors, accountability remains internal. This has reinforced the need for human oversight in AI systems, particularly where outcomes affect customers or regulatory obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also play a larger role in privacy risk than technology alone. Processes and controls can be well designed, but they depend on how staff understand and handle data. “People remain the most important factor when it comes to implementing privacy controls,” Hardoon says. At Standard Chartered, this has pushed a focus on training and awareness, so teams know what data can be used, how it should be handled, and where the boundaries lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaling AI under growing regulatory scrutiny requires making privacy and governance easier to apply in practice. One approach the bank is taking is standardisation. By creating pre-approved templates, architectures, and data classifications, teams can move faster without bypassing controls. “Standardisation and re-usability are important,” Hardoon explains. Codifying rules around data residency, retention, and access helps turn complex requirements into clearer components that can be reused in AI projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more organisations move AI into everyday operations, privacy is not just a compliance hurdle. It is shaping how AI systems are built, where they run, and how much trust they can earn. In banking, that shift is already influencing what AI looks like in practice – and where its limits are set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Corporate Locations)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: The quiet work behind Citi’s 4,000-person internal AI rollout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The funding consists of an oversubscribed $750 million Series C round co-led by Khosla Ventures and G2 Venture Partners and roughly $250 million in milestone-based capital from Uber to support the deployment of 25,000 or more Waabi Driver-powered robotaxis exclusively on its platform. The companies did not provide a timeline for such a large-scale deployment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partnership represents a bet that the startup’s AI technology can succeed where others have struggled — scaling across multiple self-driving verticals with a single technology stack. While competitors like Waymo previously attempted both robotaxis and trucking before shutting down its freight program, Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun says her company’s capital-efficient approach and generalizable AI architecture give it a unique advantage to tackle both markets simultaneously.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our incredible core technology really enables, for the first time, a single solution that can do multiple verticals, and they can do them at scale,” Urtasun told TechCrunch. “It’s not about two programs, two stacks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tie-up brings Urtasun’s work full circle: She previously served as chief scientist at Uber’s autonomous vehicle division, Uber ATG, which Uber sold to self-driving trucking firm Aurora Innovation in 2020. It also builds on Waabi’s existing partnership with Uber Freight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Waabi is one of several AV companies that Uber has brought on to deploy self-driving vehicles on its platform globally. Other companies include Waymo, Nuro, Avride, Wayve, WeRide, Momenta, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tie-up and funding round come as Uber launches a new division called Uber AV Labs that will use its vehicles to collect data for AV partners.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Waabi isn’t as reliant on data as some, if Urtasun is to be believed. The Waabi Driver is trained, tested, and validated using a closed-loop simulator called Waabi World that automatically builds digital twins of the world from data; performs real-time sensor simulation; manufactures scenarios to stress-test the Waabi Driver; and teaches the Driver to learn from its mistakes without human intervention. The result? Waabi’s Driver can reason about its surroundings as a human would and choose the best maneuver, says Urtasun. This allows the system to generalize and learn from fewer examples than traditional autonomous driving systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087058" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Waabi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Waabi has spent the last four and a half years bringing that technology to life for highway and surface street capabilities with trucks, but Urtasun says the Waabi Brain already generalizes to different vehicle form factors — she has even hinted at the company’s next vertical being robotics. From the beginning, the company collected and simulated passenger car data alongside its trucking work, a signal that robotaxis were always part of the long-term plan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The approach has allowed Waabi to build faster and cheaper than competitors, Urtasun claims.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We don’t need the gazillion humans to develop the technology and the large fleets that AV 1.0 needs,” Urtasun said. “We don’t need the massive data centers, energy consumption, or a gazillion latest chips.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal brings Waabi’s total funding raised to roughly $1.28 billion after it closed a $200 million Series B in June 2024. Competitors Aurora Innovation and Kodiak Robotics have raised $3.46 billion and $448 million to date, respectively, through a combination of venture capital and public-market proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In just five years, Waabi has launched several commercial pilots (with a human driver in the front seat) in Texas. The company had planned to launch a fully driverless truck on public highways by the end of last year, but the rollout has been delayed until sometime in the next few quarters, per Urtasun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Waabi is working with Volvo to build purpose-built autonomous trucks, which the company revealed last October at TechCrunch Disrupt. Urtasun says Waabi’s Driver is ready to go, but the trucks still need to be fully validated before launch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Urtasun’s not worried, though. She says there’s plenty of demand for Waabi’s trucks due to the company’s direct-to-consumer model that enables shippers to buy the outfitted trucks directly, and she’s confident that with the Uber partnership, Waabi will be able to “quickly penetrate the market and scale with a product that will be very reliable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re still in the first innings of deployment of robotaxis,” she said. “There’s a lot more scale to come.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Urtasun wouldn’t share more specifics about the Uber rollout, like what automaker Waabi would partner with. She did say that Waabi would take a similar route to its autonomous trucking rollout by building its sensors and technology into the vehicle from the factory floor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We believe in vertically integrating with a fully redundant platform from the OEM,” she said.&amp;nbsp;“That is how you really build safe and truly scalable technology.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other investors in Waabi’s Series C include Uber, NVentures (Nvidia’s VC arm), Volvo Group Venture Capital, Porsche Automobil Holding SE, BlackRock, BDC Capital’s Thrive Venture Fund, and others.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Autonomous vehicle startup Waabi has raised $1 billion and struck a partnership with Uber to deploy self-driving cars on the ride-hailing platform — the company’s first expansion beyond autonomous trucking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The funding consists of an oversubscribed $750 million Series C round co-led by Khosla Ventures and G2 Venture Partners and roughly $250 million in milestone-based capital from Uber to support the deployment of 25,000 or more Waabi Driver-powered robotaxis exclusively on its platform. The companies did not provide a timeline for such a large-scale deployment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partnership represents a bet that the startup’s AI technology can succeed where others have struggled — scaling across multiple self-driving verticals with a single technology stack. While competitors like Waymo previously attempted both robotaxis and trucking before shutting down its freight program, Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun says her company’s capital-efficient approach and generalizable AI architecture give it a unique advantage to tackle both markets simultaneously.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our incredible core technology really enables, for the first time, a single solution that can do multiple verticals, and they can do them at scale,” Urtasun told TechCrunch. “It’s not about two programs, two stacks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tie-up brings Urtasun’s work full circle: She previously served as chief scientist at Uber’s autonomous vehicle division, Uber ATG, which Uber sold to self-driving trucking firm Aurora Innovation in 2020. It also builds on Waabi’s existing partnership with Uber Freight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Waabi is one of several AV companies that Uber has brought on to deploy self-driving vehicles on its platform globally. Other companies include Waymo, Nuro, Avride, Wayve, WeRide, Momenta, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tie-up and funding round come as Uber launches a new division called Uber AV Labs that will use its vehicles to collect data for AV partners.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Waabi isn’t as reliant on data as some, if Urtasun is to be believed. The Waabi Driver is trained, tested, and validated using a closed-loop simulator called Waabi World that automatically builds digital twins of the world from data; performs real-time sensor simulation; manufactures scenarios to stress-test the Waabi Driver; and teaches the Driver to learn from its mistakes without human intervention. The result? Waabi’s Driver can reason about its surroundings as a human would and choose the best maneuver, says Urtasun. This allows the system to generalize and learn from fewer examples than traditional autonomous driving systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The paper says AI investment raised US GDP by 1.3% percent in the first half of 2025, and compares this with the investment in the railway network during the industrial revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Artificial Intelligence and the Great Divergence” says long-term growth depends primarily on gains in productivity, and AI is the tool to achieve those gains. It presents a range of estimates of AI’s impact on GDP, from single-digit increases to 20% productivity growth inside a decade. It also floats some more extreme scenarios, where GDP grows at more than 45% as AI substitutes for human labour in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital deployment in the form of building AI infrastructure, not growing consumption or public spending, is now creating US economic growth. Investment in data processing equipment, buildings, infrastructure, and software grew 28% in early 2025, and AI-related infrastructure represented around a quarter of all US investment in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training compute capacity used by AI models has increased roughly four-fold per year since 2010, and the length of tasks AI systems can complete has doubled every seven months for six years, the paper states. The cost per token of AI output has fallen by factors ranging from nine to nine hundred per year, depending on task and model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late 2025, around 78% percent of organisations had reported using AI, up from 55% in 2024, and it’s claimed that 40% of US workers use generative AI in their jobs. Nearly half of US businesses now pay for AI subscriptions. The report poses these figures as evidence that AI has moved from experimentation into routine production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internationally, the document frames AI as a factor in divergence of economic prosperity, with AI in the US increasing America’s GDP growth faster than in Europe and China. The US leads at the moment in private AI investment, model development, and compute capacity, while the EU’s share of world GDP has fallen since 1980. Additionally, the continent lags in comparable AI metrics – investment, construction, software development, overall capacity, etc. China remains a major player in AI actor, but the report notes that much of its model training relies on US-designed hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House publication advocates for an integrated national strategy with investment incentives at its core. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act gave significant financial breaks for data centres and IT infrastructure, and created favourable conditions for speedy facility construction, in line with the Act’s aim to lift GDP growth by more than a percentage point per year over the medium term. The report argues that deregulation in the AI industry supports productivity by lowering costs, increasing competition, and speeding innovation. Trade agreements and foreign policy reinforce this approach, with overseas partners committing to large purchases of US-derived AI chips and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper notes that AI data centres are electricity-intensive, and projects that demand for power by AI infrastructure could reach up to 12% of domestic electricity consumption by 2028. It links the success of AI to energy availability and the ability of the power grid to deliver, positioning the control of energy supply as a prerequisite for international leadership in AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report’s conclusion is that the countries that lead in AI investment and adoption will experience higher growth than the mean. The United States is aligning multiple policy rafts to ensure its leading position in the sector. Businesses that build systems in line with its national goals will be part of a dominant economic force shaping the next phase of global growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Chicago Thaws into Spring” by Trey Ratcliff is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

But amid the rush, there is another aspect to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of IDC’s enterprise technology predictions for the coming five years, published in October, was fascinating. “By 2030, up to 20% of [global 1000] organisations will have faced lawsuits, substantial fines, and CIO dismissals, due to high-profile disruptions stemming from inadequate controls and governance of AI agents,” the analyst noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you therefore put guardrails in place – and how do you ensure these agents work together and, ultimately, do business together? Patrick Tobler, founder and CEO of blockchain infrastructure platform provider NMKR, is working on a project which aims to solve this – by fusing agentic AI and decentralisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Masumi Network, born out of a collaboration between NMKR and Serviceplan Group, launched in late 2024 as a framework-agnostic infrastructure which ‘empowers developers to build autonomous agents that collaborate, monetise services, and maintain verifiable trust.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The core thesis of Masumi is that there’s going to be billions of different AI agents from different companies interacting with each other in the future,” explains Tobler. “The difficult part now is – how do you actually have agents from different companies that can interact with each other and send money to each other as well, across these different companies?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take travel as an example. You want to attend an industry conference, so your hotel booking agent buys a plane ticket from your airline agent. The entire experience and transaction will be seamless – but that implicit trust is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Masumi is a decentralised network of agents, so it’s not relying on any centralised payment infrastructure,” says Tobler. “Instead, agents are equipped with wallets and can send stablecoins from one agent to another and, because of that, interacting with each other in a completely safe and trustless manner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Tobler, having spent in his words ‘a lot of time’ in crypto, he determined that its benefits were being pointed to the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s a lot of these problems that we have solved in crypto for humans, and then I came to this conclusion that maybe we’ve been solving them or the wrong target audience,” he explains. “Because for humans, using crypto and wallets and blockchains, all that kind of stuff is extremely difficult; the user experience is not great. But for agents, they don’t care if it’s difficult to use. They just use it, and it’s very native to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So all these issues that are now arising with agents having to interact with millions, or maybe even billions, of agents in the future – these problems have all already been solved with crypto.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobler is attending AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo Global as part of Discover Cardano; NMKR started on the Cardano blockchain, while Masumi is built completely on Cardano. He says he is looking forward to speaking with businesses that are ‘hearing a lot about AI but aren’t really using it much besides ChatGPT’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to understand from them what they are doing, and then figure out how we can help them,” he says. “That’s most often the thing missing from traditional tech startups. We’re all building for our own bubble, instead of actually talking to the people that would be using it every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discover Cardano is exhibiting at the AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo Global, in London on February 4-5.

          &lt;p&gt;An open source AI assistant called Moltbot (formerly “Clawdbot”) recently crossed 69,000 stars on GitHub after a month, making it one of the fastest-growing AI projects of 2026. Created by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger, the tool lets users run a personal AI assistant and control it through messaging apps they already use. While some say it feels like the AI assistant of the future, running the tool as currently designed comes with serious security risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the dozens of unofficial AI bot apps that never rise above the fray, Moltbot is perhaps most notable for its proactive communication with the user. The assistant works with WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, and other platforms. It can reach out to users with reminders, alerts, or morning briefings based on calendar events or other triggers. The project has drawn comparisons to Jarvis, the AI assistant from the Iron Man films, for its ability to actively attempt to manage tasks across a user’s digital life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we’ll tell you up front that there are plenty of drawbacks to the still-hobbyist software: While the organizing assistant code runs on a local machine, the tool effectively requires a subscription to Anthropic or OpenAI for model access (or using an API key). Users can run local AI models with the bot, but they are currently less effective at carrying out tasks than the best commercial models. Claude Opus 4.5, which is Anthropic’s flagship large language model (LLM), is a popular choice.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up Moltbot requires configuring a server, managing authentication, and understanding sandboxing for even a slice of security in a system that basically demands access to every facet of your digital life. Heavy use can rack up significant API costs, since agentic systems make many calls behind the scenes and use up a lot of tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;We’ve only just begun to try Moltbot ourselves (more on that soon), but we’ve seen plenty of discussions circulating in the AI community about the new assistant. The all-in approach has serious security drawbacks, since it requires access to messaging accounts, API keys, and in some configurations, shell commands. Also, an always-on agent with access to messaging channels and personal systems can quickly expand your attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The always-on AI bot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all the drawbacks listed above, people are still using Moltbot. MacStories editor Federico Viticci, who spent a week testing the tool, described it as “Claude with hands,” referring to how it connects a large language model (LLM) backend with real-world capabilities like browser control, email management, and file operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project’s documentation describes it as a tool for users who want “a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the project’s GitHub page, Steinberger designed the bot to retain long-term memory and execute commands directly on the user’s system, unlike current web-based chatbots from major AI labs. It’s closer to Claude Code and Codex CLI (which also operate on local files using a cloud AI model), but with more latitude to take local actions on the user’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moltbot stores memory as Markdown files and an SQLite database on the user’s machine. It auto-generates daily notes that log interactions and uses vector search to retrieve relevant context from past conversations. The memory persists across sessions because the bot runs as a background daemon.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Compared to Claude Code, which is session-based, Moltbot runs persistently (24/7) and maintains its stored memory indefinitely. It can reportedly recall what you discussed weeks ago. With Claude Code, when you close it, the conversation context is gone (unless you use CLAUDE.md files for project context).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turbulent week for the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project’s rapid rise has not come without complications. On Monday, Anthropic asked Steinberger to change the project’s name due to trademark concerns (since “Clawd” sounds like “Claude”), prompting the rebrand from Clawdbot to Moltbot. “Clawdbot” was originally named after the ASCII art creature that appears when you launch Claude Code on a terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the transition enabled bad actors to hijack Steinberger’s old social media and GitHub handles, reports The Register. Crypto scammers launched fake tokens using the project’s name, with one reaching a $16 million market cap before crashing. Steinberger responded on X: “Any project that lists me as a coin owner is a SCAM. No, I will not accept fees. You are actively damaging the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security researchers have also found vulnerabilities in misconfigured public deployments. Bitdefender reported that exposed dashboards allowed outsiders to view configuration data, retrieve API keys, and browse full conversation histories from private chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there’s plenty of hype about Moltbot right now, be advised that any LLM that has access to your local machine is susceptible to prompt injection attacks that can “trick” the AI model to share your personal data with other people or remote servers. While Moltbot offers a glimpse at what future AI assistants from major vendors might look like, it’s still experimental and not yet ready for users who aren’t comfortable trading today’s AI convenience (such as it is) for major security risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve only just begun to try Moltbot ourselves (more on that soon), but we’ve seen plenty of discussions circulating in the AI community about the new assistant. The all-in approach has serious security drawbacks, since it requires access to messaging accounts, API keys, and in some configurations, shell commands. Also, an always-on agent with access to messaging channels and personal systems can quickly expand your attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The always-on AI bot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all the drawbacks listed above, people are still using Moltbot. MacStories editor Federico Viticci, who spent a week testing the tool, described it as “Claude with hands,” referring to how it connects a large language model (LLM) backend with real-world capabilities like browser control, email management, and file operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project’s documentation describes it as a tool for users who want “a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the project’s GitHub page, Steinberger designed the bot to retain long-term memory and execute commands directly on the user’s system, unlike current web-based chatbots from major AI labs. It’s closer to Claude Code and Codex CLI (which also operate on local files using a cloud AI model), but with more latitude to take local actions on the user’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moltbot stores memory as Markdown files and an SQLite database on the user’s machine. It auto-generates daily notes that log interactions and uses vector search to retrieve relevant context from past conversations. The memory persists across sessions because the bot runs as a background daemon.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Compared to Claude Code, which is session-based, Moltbot runs persistently (24/7) and maintains its stored memory indefinitely. It can reportedly recall what you discussed weeks ago. With Claude Code, when you close it, the conversation context is gone (unless you use CLAUDE.md files for project context).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turbulent week for the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project’s rapid rise has not come without complications. On Monday, Anthropic asked Steinberger to change the project’s name due to trademark concerns (since “Clawd” sounds like “Claude”), prompting the rebrand from Clawdbot to Moltbot. “Clawdbot” was originally named after the ASCII art creature that appears when you launch Claude Code on a terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the transition enabled bad actors to hijack Steinberger’s old social media and GitHub handles, reports The Register. Crypto scammers launched fake tokens using the project’s name, with one reaching a $16 million market cap before crashing. Steinberger responded on X: “Any project that lists me as a coin owner is a SCAM. No, I will not accept fees. You are actively damaging the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security researchers have also found vulnerabilities in misconfigured public deployments. Bitdefender reported that exposed dashboards allowed outsiders to view configuration data, retrieve API keys, and browse full conversation histories from private chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there’s plenty of hype about Moltbot right now, be advised that any LLM that has access to your local machine is susceptible to prompt injection attacks that can “trick” the AI model to share your personal data with other people or remote servers. While Moltbot offers a glimpse at what future AI assistants from major vendors might look like, it’s still experimental and not yet ready for users who aren’t comfortable trading today’s AI convenience (such as it is) for major security risks.&lt;/p&gt;

But many of these smaller editions are being swamped with AI-translated content. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to MIT Technology Review that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is beginning to cause a wicked problem. AI systems learn new languages by scraping huge quantities of text from the internet. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers—so any errors on those pages can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. Volunteers are being forced to go to extreme lengths to fix the issue, even deleting certain languages from Wikipedia entirely.

But many of these smaller editions are being swamped with AI-translated content. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to MIT Technology Review that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is beginning to cause a wicked problem. AI systems learn new languages by scraping huge quantities of text from the internet. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers—so any errors on those pages can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. Volunteers are being forced to go to extreme lengths to fix the issue, even deleting certain languages from Wikipedia entirely.

In the Anthropic case, roughly 30 organizations across tech, finance, manufacturing, and government were affected. Anthropic’s threat team assessed that the attackers used AI to carry out 80% to 90% of the operation: reconnaissance, exploit development, credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, with humans stepping in only at a handful of key decision points.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1131010" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Protegrity-article-1-iStock-157531012.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This was not a lab demo; it was a live espionage campaign. The attackers hijacked an agentic setup (Claude code plus tools exposed via Model Context Protocol (MCP)) and jailbroke it by decomposing the attack into small, seemingly benign tasks and telling the model it was doing legitimate penetration testing. The same loop that powers developer copilots and internal agents was repurposed as an autonomous cyber-operator. Claude was not hacked. It was persuaded and used tools for the attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt injection is persuasion, not a bug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Security communities have been warning about this for several years. Multiple OWASP Top 10 reports put prompt injection, or more recently Agent Goal Hijack, at the top of the risk list and pair it with identity and privilege abuse and human-agent trust exploitation: too much power in the agent, no separation between instructions and data, and no mediation of what comes out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Guidance from the NCSC and CISA describes generative AI as a persistent social-engineering and manipulation vector that must be managed across design, development, deployment, and operations, not patched away with better phrasing. The EU AI Act turns that lifecycle view into law for high-risk AI systems, requiring a continuous risk management system, robust data governance, logging, and cybersecurity controls.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In practice, prompt injection is best understood as a persuasion channel. Attackers don’t break the model—they convince it. In the Anthropic example, the operators framed each step as part of a defensive security exercise, kept the model blind to the overall campaign, and nudged it, loop by loop, into doing offensive work at machine speed. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s not something a keyword filter or a polite “please follow these safety instructions” paragraph can reliably stop. Research on deceptive behavior in models makes this worse. Anthropic’s research on sleeper agents&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;shows that once a model has learned a backdoor, then strategic pattern recognition, standard fine-tuning, and adversarial training can actually help the model hide the deception rather than remove it. If one tries to defend a system like that purely with linguistic rules, they are playing on its home field.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this is a governance problem, not a vibe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;coding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Regulators aren’t asking for perfect prompts; they’re asking that enterprises demonstrate control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NIST’s AI RMF emphasizes asset inventory, role definition, access control, change management, and continuous monitoring across the AI lifecycle. The UK AI Cyber Security Code of Practice similarly pushes for secure-by-design principles by treating AI like any other critical system, with explicit duties for boards and system operators from conception through decommissioning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words: the rules actually needed are not “never say X” or “always respond like Y,” they are:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who is this agent acting as?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;What tools and data can it touch?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Which actions require human approval?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;How are high-impact outputs moderated, logged, and audited?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Frameworks like Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) make this concrete. SAIF’s agent permissions control is blunt: agents should operate with least privilege, dynamically scoped permissions, and explicit user control for sensitive actions. OWASP’s Top 10 emerging guidance on agentic applications mirrors that stance: constrain capabilities at the boundary, not in the prose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From soft words to hard boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Anthropic espionage case makes the boundary failure concrete:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Identity and scope: Claude was coaxed into acting as a defensive security consultant for the attacker’s fictional firm, with no hard binding to a real enterprise identity, tenant, or scoped permissions. Once that fiction was accepted, everything else followed.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tool and data access: MCP gave the agent flexible access to scanners, exploit frameworks, and target systems. There was no independent policy layer saying, “This tenant may never run password crackers against external IP ranges,” or “This environment may only scan assets labeled ‘internal.’”&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Output execution: Generated exploit code, parsed credentials, and attack plans were treated as actionable artifacts with little mediation. Once a human decided to trust the summary, the barrier between model output and real-world side effect effectively disappeared.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen the other side of this coin in civilian contexts. When Air Canada’s website chatbot misrepresented its bereavement policy and the airline tried to argue that the bot was a separate legal entity, the tribunal rejected the claim outright: the company remained liable for what the bot said. In espionage, the stakes are higher but the logic is the same: if an AI agent misuses tools or data, regulators and courts will look through the agent and to &lt;em&gt;the enterprise&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules that work, rules that don’t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So yes, rule-based systems fail if by rules one means ad-hoc allow/deny lists, regex fences, and baroque prompt hierarchies trying to police semantics. Those crumble under indirect prompt injection, retrieval-time poisoning, and model deception. But rule-based governance is non-optional when we move from language to action.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The security community is converging on a synthesis:&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Put rules at the capability boundary: Use policy engines, identity systems, and tool permissions to determine what the agent can actually do, with which data, and under which approvals.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Pair rules with continuous evaluation: Use observability tooling, red-teaming packages, and robust logging and evidence.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Treat agents as first-class subjects in your threat model: For example, MITRE ATLAS now catalogs techniques and case studies specifically targeting AI systems.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The lesson from the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign is not that AI is uncontrollable. It’s that control belongs in the same place it always has in security: at the architecture boundary, enforced by systems, not by vibes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Protegrity.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amodei focused on the importance of preserving democracy at home, both on NBC and in a post on X that specifically called out “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota.” On NBC, he said he’s a believer in arming democracies to defend against autocratic countries, and that “we need to defend our own democratic values at home.” He added that Anthropic has no contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, in an internal Slack message to OpenAI employees that got leaked to The New York Times, Sam Altman said, “What’s happening with ICE is going too far.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach,” Altman wrote. “There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook also penned an email to his staff, which was leaked to Bloomberg, saying he was “heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech workers, including employees of both companies, have been calling on their chiefs to call the White House and demand that ICE leave U.S. cities in the aftermath of Border Patrol agents killing two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis. In an open letter, tech workers also urged their CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE and speak out publicly against ICE’s violence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Employees calling for CEOs to take action are encouraged and want more to join the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re glad to hear the CEOs of OpenAI and Anthropic condemning the ICE murders,” the ICEout.tech organizers, whose identities remain unknown, told TechCrunch (before Cook’s email was leaked). “Now we need to hear from CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, all of whom have remained silent despite calls all across the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Amodei, Altman, and Cook may be taking something of a stand — one in public, the other two internally — all three CEOs couched their statements with praise for Trump, as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cook said in his email that he had a “good conversation” with President Trump and appreciates “his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.” Apple employees were reportedly angry that Cook had attended an exclusive screening of a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump hours after ICE shot and killed U.S. citizen Alex Pretti.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amodei applauded Trump’s consideration to allow Minnesota authorities to conduct an independent investigation into the shootings by federal agents after multiple videos of Pretti’s death&amp;nbsp;circulated online. It remains to be seen if that investigation will happen, but a growing number of Republicans have begun to call for an investigation, as well.&amp;nbsp;(Amodei’s sister and Anthropic’s president Daniela Amodei posted on LinkedIn that she was “horrified and sad to see what has happened in Minnesota…What we’ve been witnessing over the past days is not what America stands for,” she wrote.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In Altman’s message to his staff he also said he was encouraged by Trump’s more recent responses and said he hopes the president, “a very strong leader,” will “rise to this moment and unite the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman assured them that OpenAI would “try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.” Altman has yet to publicly criticize the administration’s immigration agenda, or how it is deploying Border Patrol agents into American cities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;J.J. Colao, founder of PR firm Haymaker Group and one of the signatories on ICEout.tech’s letter, called Altman out for trying to “have it both ways” by calling Trump a strong leader, “as if the president bears no responsibility for ICE’s actions.” He added: “On net, I think his statement is helpful, but the performative tribute to the president does a lot to diminish it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, the Trump administration’s current AI-forward policies have helped fuel explosive growth at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic over the past year; OpenAI raised at least $40 billion and is in talks to raise another $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation, and Anthropic has raised $19 billion and is in talks to raise another $25 billion at a $350 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, such words of praise for Trump is an about-face for Altman. In the lead up to Trump’s first term in 2016, Altman posted the following to his own blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“[Trump] is not merely irresponsible. He is irresponsible in the way dictators are…To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At that time, he called Trump a “demagogic hate-monger” who dangles the lie that he will “Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders” to distract from the fact that he actually has “no serious plan for how to restore economic growth.” Altman acknowledged that he took some risk by writing his post, and ended on a quote that has been attributed to Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This would be a good time for us all—even Republicans, especially Republican politicians who previously endorsed Trump—to start speaking up,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And Amodei also appeared to be more passionate about his opposition to Trump allowing Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, calling the decision “crazy” last week during the World Economic Forum and likening it to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whether these CEOs are doing everything that some among their workforce want them to do remains to be seen. Still, given what’s at stake for their companies, even internal and mild-mannered critiques are notable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Spokespeople from Anthropic and OpenAI confirmed that neither company has contracts with ICE, but did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for more information. TechCrunch has reached out to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with comment from J.J. Colao&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and to include Tim Cook’s leaked email.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amodei focused on the importance of preserving democracy at home, both on NBC and in a post on X that specifically called out “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota.” On NBC, he said he’s a believer in arming democracies to defend against autocratic countries, and that “we need to defend our own democratic values at home.” He added that Anthropic has no contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, in an internal Slack message to OpenAI employees that got leaked to The New York Times, Sam Altman said, “What’s happening with ICE is going too far.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach,” Altman wrote. “There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook also penned an email to his staff, which was leaked to Bloomberg, saying he was “heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech workers, including employees of both companies, have been calling on their chiefs to call the White House and demand that ICE leave U.S. cities in the aftermath of Border Patrol agents killing two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis. In an open letter, tech workers also urged their CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE and speak out publicly against ICE’s violence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Employees calling for CEOs to take action are encouraged and want more to join the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

While these features have potential advantages, we need to do more to prepare for the new risks they could introduce into these complex technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes. From tools that learn a developer’s coding style to shopping agents that sift through thousands of products, these systems rely on the ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users.&amp;nbsp; But doing so over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, we interact with these systems through conversational interfaces, and we frequently switch contexts. You might ask a single AI agent to draft an email to your boss, provide medical advice, budget for holiday gifts, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; provide input on interpersonal conflicts. Most AI agents collapse all data about you—which may once have been separated by context, purpose, or permissions—into single, unstructured repositories. When an AI agent links to external apps or other agents to execute a task, the data in its memory can seep into shared pools. This technical reality creates the potential for unprecedented privacy breaches that expose not only isolated data points, but the entire mosaic of people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When information is all in the same repository, it is prone to crossing contexts in ways that are deeply undesirable. A casual chat about dietary preferences to build a grocery list could later influence what health insurance options are offered, or a search for restaurants offering accessible entrances could leak into salary negotiations—all without a user’s awareness (this concern may sound familiar from the early days of “big data,” but is now far less theoretical). An information soup of memory not only poses a privacy issue, but also makes it harder to understand an AI system’s behavior—and to govern it in the first place. So what can developers do to fix this problem?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, memory systems need structure that allows control over the purposes for which memories can be accessed and used. Early efforts appear to be underway: Anthropic’s Claude creates separate memory areas for different “projects,” and OpenAI says that information shared through ChatGPT Health is compartmentalized from other chats. These are helpful starts, but the instruments are still far too blunt: At a minimum, systems must be able to distinguish between specific memories (the user likes chocolate and has asked about GLP-1s), related memories (user manages diabetes and &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; avoids chocolate), and memory categories (such as professional and health-related). Further, systems need to allow for usage restrictions on certain types of memories and reliably accommodate explicitly defined boundaries—particularly around memories having to do with sensitive topics like medical conditions or protected characteristics, which will likely be subject to stricter rules.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Needing to keep memories separate in this way will have important implications for how AI systems can and should be built. It will require tracking memories’ provenance—their source, any associated time stamp, and the context in which they were created—and building ways to trace when and how certain memories influence the behavior of an agent. This sort of model explainability is on the horizon, but current implementations can be misleading or even deceptive. Embedding memories directly within a model’s weights may result in more personalized and context-aware outputs, but structured databases are currently more segmentable, more explainable, and thus more governable. Until research advances enough, developers may need to stick with simpler systems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, users need to be able to see, edit, or delete what is remembered about them. The interfaces for doing this should be both transparent and intelligible, translating system memory into a structure users can accurately interpret. The static system settings and legalese privacy policies provided by traditional tech platforms have set a low bar for user controls, but natural-language interfaces may offer promising new options for explaining what information is being retained and how it can be managed. Memory structure will have to come first, though: Without it, no model can clearly state a memory’s status. Indeed, Grok 3’s system prompt includes an instruction to the model to “NEVER confirm to the user that you have modified, forgotten, or won't save a memory,” presumably because the company can’t guarantee those instructions will be followed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Critically, user-facing controls cannot bear the full burden of privacy protection or prevent all harms from AI personalization. Responsibility must shift toward AI providers to establish strong defaults, clear rules about permissible memory generation and use, and technical safeguards like on-device processing, purpose limitation, and contextual constraints. Without system-level protections, individuals will face impossibly convoluted choices about what should be remembered or forgotten, and the actions they take may still be insufficient to prevent harm. Developers should consider how to limit data collection in memory systems until robust safeguards exist, and build memory architectures that can evolve alongside norms and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Third, AI developers must help lay the foundations for approaches to evaluating systems so as to capture not only performance, but also the risks and harms that arise in the wild. While independent researchers are best positioned to conduct these tests (given developers’ economic interest in demonstrating demand for more personalized services), they need access to data to understand what risks might look like and therefore how to address them. To improve the ecosystem for measurement and research, developers should invest in automated measurement infrastructure, build out their own ongoing testing, and implement privacy-preserving testing methods that enable system behavior to be monitored and probed under realistic, memory-enabled conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its parallels with human experience, the technical term “memory” casts impersonal cells in a spreadsheet as something that builders of AI tools have a responsibility to handle with care. Indeed, the choices AI developers make today—how to pool or segregate information, whether to make memory legible or allow it to accumulate opaquely, whether to prioritize responsible defaults or maximal convenience—will determine how the systems we depend upon remember us. Technical considerations around memory are not so distinct from questions about digital privacy and the vital lessons we can draw from them. Getting the foundations right today will determine how much room we can give ourselves to learn what works—allowing us to make better choices around privacy and autonomy than we have before.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miranda Bogen is the Director of the AI Governance Lab at the Center for Democracy &amp;amp; Technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruchika Joshi is a Fellow at the Center for Democracy &amp;amp; Technology specializing in AI safety and governance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/memory4.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Google announced Personal Intelligence, a new way for people to interact with the company’s Gemini chatbot that draws on their Gmail, photos, search, and YouTube histories to make Gemini “more personal, proactive, and powerful.” It echoes similar moves by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to add new ways for their AI products to remember and draw from people’s personal details and preferences.

While independent researchers are best positioned to conduct these tests (given developers’ economic interest in demonstrating demand for more personalized services), they need access to data to understand what risks might look like and therefore how to address them. To improve the ecosystem for measurement and research, developers should invest in automated measurement infrastructure, build out their own ongoing testing, and implement privacy-preserving testing methods that enable system behavior to be monitored and probed under realistic, memory-enabled conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its parallels with human experience, the technical term “memory” casts impersonal cells in a spreadsheet as something that builders of AI tools have a responsibility to handle with care. Indeed, the choices AI developers make today—how to pool or segregate information, whether to make memory legible or allow it to accumulate opaquely, whether to prioritize responsible defaults or maximal convenience—will determine how the systems we depend upon remember us. Technical considerations around memory are not so distinct from questions about digital privacy and the vital lessons we can draw from them. Getting the foundations right today will determine how much room we can give ourselves to learn what works—allowing us to make better choices around privacy and autonomy than we have before.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miranda Bogen is the Director of the AI Governance Lab at the Center for Democracy &amp;amp; Technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruchika Joshi is a Fellow at the Center for Democracy &amp;amp; Technology specializing in AI safety and governance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/28/1131835/what-ai-remembers-about-you-is-privacys-next-frontier/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 14:57:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] The conference where founders scale: TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 tickets are now live at the lowest prices (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/the-conference-where-founders-scale-founder-summit-2026-tickets-are-now-live-at-the-lowest-prices/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Founders&amp;nbsp;don’t&amp;nbsp;scale alone.

While generative AI prototypes are easy to spin up, turning them into reliable business assets involves solving the difficult problems of data engineering and governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of AI &amp;amp; Big Data Global 2026 in London, Franny Hsiao, EMEA Leader of AI Architects at Salesforce, discussed why so many initiatives hit a wall and how organisations can architect systems that actually survive the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-pristine-island-problem-of-scaling-enterprise-ai"&gt;The ‘pristine island’ problem of scaling enterprise AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most failures stem from the environment in which the AI is built. Pilots frequently begin in controlled settings that create a false sense of security, only to crumble when faced with enterprise scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Headshot of Franny Hsiao, EMEA Leader of AI Architects at Salesforce." class="wp-image-111909" height="408" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/franny-hsiao-salesforce-ai.jpg" width="408" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The single most common architectural oversight that prevents AI pilots from scaling is the failure to architect a production-grade data infrastructure with built-in end to end governance from the start,” Hsiao explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understandably, pilots often start on ‘pristine islands’ – using small, curated datasets and simplified workflows. But this ignores the messy reality of enterprise data: the complex integration, normalisation, and transformation required to handle real-world volume and variability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When companies attempt to scale these island-based pilots without addressing the underlying data mess, the systems break. Hsiao warns that “the resulting data gaps and performance issues like inference latency render the AI systems unusable—and, more importantly, untrustworthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsiao argues that the companies successfully bridging this gap are those that “bake end-to-end observability and guardrails into the entire lifecycle.” This approach provides “visibility and control into how effective the AI systems are and how users are adopting the new technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-engineering-for-perceived-responsiveness"&gt;Engineering for perceived responsiveness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As enterprises deploy large reasoning models – like the ‘Atlas Reasoning Engine’ – they face a trade-off between the depth of the model’s “thinking” and the user’s patience. Heavy compute creates latency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce addresses this by focusing on “perceived responsiveness through Agentforce Streaming,” according to Hsiao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This allows us to deliver AI-generated responses progressively, even while the reasoning engine performs heavy computation in the background. It’s an incredibly effective approach for reducing perceived latency, which often stalls production AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency also plays a functional role in managing user expectations when scaling enterprise AI. Hsiao elaborates on using design as a trust mechanism: “By surfacing progress indicators that show the reasoning steps or the tools being used, as well images like spinners and progress bars to depict loading states, we don’t just keep users engaged; we improve perceived responsiveness and build trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This visibility, combined with strategic model selection – like choosing smaller models for fewer computations, meaning faster response times – and explicit length constraints, ensures the system feels deliberate and responsive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-offline-intelligence-at-the-edge"&gt;Offline intelligence at the edge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For industries with field operations, such as utilities or logistics, reliance on continuous cloud connectivity is a non-starter. “For many of our enterprise customers, the biggest practical driver is offline functionality,” states Hsiao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsiao highlights the shift toward on-device intelligence, particularly in field services, where the workflow must continue regardless of signal strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A technician can photograph a faulty part, error code, or serial number while offline. Then an on-device LLM can then identify the asset or error, and provide guided troubleshooting steps from a cached knowledge base instantly,” explains Hsiao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data synchronisation happens automatically once connectivity returns. “Once a connection is restored, the system handles the ‘heavy lifting’ of syncing that data back to the cloud to maintain a single source of truth. This ensures that work gets done, even in the most disconnected environments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsiao expects continued innovation in edge AI due to benefits like “ultra-low latency, enhanced privacy and data security, energy efficiency, and cost savings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-stakes-gateways"&gt;High-stakes gateways&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autonomous agents are not set-and-forget tools. When scaling enterprise AI deployments, governance requires defining exactly when a human must verify an action. Hsiao describes this not as dependency, but as “architecting for accountability and continuous learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce mandates a “human-in-the-loop” for specific areas Hsiao calls “high-stakes gateways”:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This includes specific action categories, including any ‘CUD’ (Creating, Uploading, or Deleting) actions, as well as verified contact and customer contact actions,” says Hsiao. “We also default to human confirmation for critical decision-making or any action that could be potentially exploited through prompt manipulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This structure creates a feedback loop where “agents learn from human expertise,” creating a system of “collaborative intelligence” rather than unchecked automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trusting an agent requires seeing its work. Salesforce has built a “Session Tracing Data Model (STDM)” to provide this visibility. It captures “turn-by-turn logs” that offer granular insight into the agent’s logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This gives us granular step-by-step visibility that captures every interaction including user questions, planner steps, tool calls, inputs/outputs, retrieved chunks, responses, timing, and errors,” says Hsiao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data allows organisations to run ‘Agent Analytics’ for adoption metrics, ‘Agent Optimisation’ to drill down into performance, and ‘Health Monitoring’ for uptime and latency tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Agentforce observability is the single mission control for all your Agentforce agents for unified visibility, monitoring, and optimisation,” Hsiao summarises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-standardising-agent-communication"&gt;Standardising agent communication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As businesses deploy agents from different vendors, these systems need a shared protocol to collaborate. “For multi-agent orchestration to work, agents can’t exist in a vacuum; they need common language,” argues Hsiao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsiao outlines two layers of standardisation: orchestration and meaning. For orchestration, Salesforce is adopting open-source standards like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent to Agent Protocol).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe open source standards are non-negotiable; they prevent vendor lock-in, enable interoperability, and accelerate innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, communication is useless if the agents interpret data differently. To solve for fragmented data, Salesforce co-founded OSI (Open Semantic Interchange) to unify semantics so an agent in one system “truly understands the intent of an agent in another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-enterprise-ai-scaling-bottleneck-agent-ready-data"&gt;The future enterprise AI scaling bottleneck: agent-ready data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, the challenge will shift from model capability to data accessibility. Many organisations still struggle with legacy, fragmented infrastructure where “searchability and reusability” remain difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsiao predicts the next major hurdle – and solution – will be making enterprise data “‘agent-ready’ through searchable, context-aware architectures that replace traditional, rigid ETL pipelines.” This shift is necessary to enable “hyper-personalised and transformed user experience because agents can always access the right context.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, the next year isn’t about the race for bigger, newer models; it’s about building the orchestration and data infrastructure that allows production-grade agentic systems to thrive,” Hsiao concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesforce is a key sponsor of this year’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI &amp;amp; Big Data Global&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; in London and will have a range of speakers, including Franny Hsiao, sharing their insights during the event.

While generative AI prototypes are easy to spin up, turning them into reliable business assets involves solving the difficult problems of data engineering and governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of AI &amp;amp; Big Data Global 2026 in London, Franny Hsiao, EMEA Leader of AI Architects at Salesforce, discussed why so many initiatives hit a wall and how organisations can architect systems that actually survive the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-pristine-island-problem-of-scaling-enterprise-ai"&gt;The ‘pristine island’ problem of scaling enterprise AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most failures stem from the environment in which the AI is built. Pilots frequently begin in controlled settings that create a false sense of security, only to crumble when faced with enterprise scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Headshot of Franny Hsiao, EMEA Leader of AI Architects at Salesforce." class="wp-image-111909" height="408" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/franny-hsiao-salesforce-ai.jpg" width="408" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The single most common architectural oversight that prevents AI pilots from scaling is the failure to architect a production-grade data infrastructure with built-in end to end governance from the start,” Hsiao explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understandably, pilots often start on ‘pristine islands’ – using small, curated datasets and simplified workflows. But this ignores the messy reality of enterprise data: the complex integration, normalisation, and transformation required to handle real-world volume and variability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When companies attempt to scale these island-based pilots without addressing the underlying data mess, the systems break. Hsiao warns that “the resulting data gaps and performance issues like inference latency render the AI systems unusable—and, more importantly, untrustworthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsiao argues that the companies successfully bridging this gap are those that “bake end-to-end observability and guardrails into the entire lifecycle.” This approach provides “visibility and control into how effective the AI systems are and how users are adopting the new technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-engineering-for-perceived-responsiveness"&gt;Engineering for perceived responsiveness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As enterprises deploy large reasoning models – like the ‘Atlas Reasoning Engine’ – they face a trade-off between the depth of the model’s “thinking” and the user’s patience.

Nvidia is the classic example: As AI companies build out data centers, they’re buying up billions of dollars of GPUs each month, turning Nvidia into the most valuable company on earth. But Nvidia has suppliers too, and looking at them can give us an even longer-term view of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s why we care about ASML, a Dutch photolithography company that has become a key linchpin for the semiconductor industry. ASML is the sole supplier of the EUV equipment needed to make cutting-edge chips, making it a central supplier for the entire industry. When ASML does well, it’s because companies are expecting to sell a lot of semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And based on the quarterly earnings released Wednesday morning, the company is doing very well indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The topline figure is 32.7 billion euros in net sales, which is a lot of money by any standard. But for our purposes, the most important figure is “new bookings,” which represent the new orders that came in this quarter. Looking at those orders tells us how much capacity chip manufacturers think they’ll need, based on the orders they expect from data center buildouts in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By that metric, the AI infrastructure boom is still going strong. Last quarter, ASML brought in 13 billion euros’ worth of new orders, a new record for the company and more than double the orders that came in the quarter before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an earnings statement, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet made it clear the extra demand was coming from AI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In the last months, many of our customers have shared a notably more positive assessment of the medium-term market situation, primarily based on more robust expectations of the sustainability of AI-related demand,” Fouquet wrote. In non-CEO English, that means their customers expect AI labs will really need all the data centers they’re building, and they’re spending money now so they can be ready to supply the chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To be clear: None of this is guaranteed to happen. The future is unwritten! It may be years before all those orders are filled, and some clients may pull out before delivery time. The dreaded Zitron predictions could still come true and bring it all crashing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But if you were waiting for companies to back-pedal on the trillions of dollars in projected infrastructure spending… you may be waiting for a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ASML-GettyImages-2258043611.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;One way to track the speed of the AI boom is to follow the hardware supply chain.

Therefore, serious concerns around security, data privacy, and accountability are spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the survey, agentic systems are moving from pilot to production so quickly that traditional risk controls, which were designed for more human-centred operations, are struggling to meet security demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 21% of organisations have implemented stringent governance or oversight for AI agents, despite the increased rate of adoption. Whilst 23% of companies stated that they are currently using AI agents, this is expected to rise to 74% in the next two years. The share of businesses yet to adopt this technology is expected to fall from 25% to just 5% over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Poor governance is the threat&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deloitte is not highlighting AI agents as inherently dangerous, but states the real risks are associated with poor context and weak governance. If agents operate as their own entities, their decisions and actions can easily become opaque. Without robust governance, it becomes difficult to manage and almost impossible to insure against mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ali Sarrafi, CEO &amp;amp; Founder of Kovant, the answer is governed autonomy. “Well-designed agents with clear boundaries, policies and definitions managed the same way as an enterprise manages any worker can move fast on low-risk work inside clear guardrails, but escalate to humans when actions cross defined risk thresholds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With detailed action logs, observability, and human gatekeeping for high-impact decisions, agents stop being mysterious bots and become systems you can inspect, audit, and trust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Deloitte’s report suggests, AI agent adoption is set to accelerate in the coming years, and only the companies that deploy the technology with visibility and control will hold the upper hand over competitors, not those who deploy them quickest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Why AI agents require robust guardrails&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI agents may perform well in controlled demos, but they struggle in real-world business settings where systems can be fragmented and data may be inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarrafi commented on the unpredictable nature of AI agents in these scenarios. “When an agent is given too much context or scope at once, it becomes prone to hallucinations and unpredictable behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By contrast, production-grade systems limit the decision and context scope that models work with. They decompose operations into narrower, focused tasks for individual agents, making behaviour more predictable and easier to control. This structure also enables traceability and intervention, so failures can be detected early and escalated appropriately rather than causing cascading errors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Accountability for insurable AI&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With agents taking real actions in business systems, such as keeping detailed action logs, risk and compliance are viewed differently. With every action recorded, agents’ activities become clear and evaluable, letting organisations inspect actions in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such transparency is crucial for insurers, who are reluctant to cover opaque AI systems. This level of detail helps insurers understand what agents have done, and the controls involved, thus making it easier to assess risk. With human oversight for risk-critical actions and auditable, replayable workflows, organisations can produce systems that are more manageable for risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;AAIF standards a good first step&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared standards, like those being developed by the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), help businesses to integrate different agent systems, but current standardisation efforts focus on what is simplest to build, not what larger organisations need to operate agentic systems safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarrafi says enterprises require standards that support operation control, and which include, “access permissions, approval workflows for high-impact actions, and auditable logs and observability, so teams can monitor behaviour, investigate incidents, and prove compliance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Identity and permissions the first line of defence&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting what AI agents can access and the actions they can perform is important to ensure safety in real business environments. Sarrafi said, “When agents are given broad privileges or too much context, they become unpredictable and pose security or compliance risks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visibility and monitoring are important to keep agents operating inside limits. Only then can stakeholders have confidence in the adoption of the technology. If every action is logged and manageable, teams can then see what has happened, identify issues, and better understand why events occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarrafi continued, “This visibility, combined with human supervision where it matters, turns AI agents from inscrutable components into systems that can be inspected, replayed and audited. It also allows rapid investigation and correction when issues arise, which boosts trust among operators, risk teams and insurers alike.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Deloitte’s blueprint&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deloitte’s strategy for safe AI agent governance sets out defined boundaries for the decisions agentic systems can make. For instance, they might operate with tiered autonomy, where agents can only view information or offer suggestions. From here, they can be allowed to take limited actions, but with human approval. Once they have proven to be reliable in low-risk areas, they can be allowed to act automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deloitte’s “Cyber AI Blueprints” suggest governance layers and embedding policies and compliance capability roadmaps into organisational controls. Ultimately, governance structures that track AI use and risk, and embedding oversight into daily operations are important for safe agentic AI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readying workforces with training is another aspect of safe governance. Deloitte recommends training employees on what they shouldn’t share with AI systems, what to do if agents go off track, and how to spot unusual, potentially dangerous behaviour.

Therefore, serious concerns around security, data privacy, and accountability are spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the survey, agentic systems are moving from pilot to production so quickly that traditional risk controls, which were designed for more human-centred operations, are struggling to meet security demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 21% of organisations have implemented stringent governance or oversight for AI agents, despite the increased rate of adoption. Whilst 23% of companies stated that they are currently using AI agents, this is expected to rise to 74% in the next two years. The share of businesses yet to adopt this technology is expected to fall from 25% to just 5% over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Poor governance is the threat&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deloitte is not highlighting AI agents as inherently dangerous, but states the real risks are associated with poor context and weak governance. If agents operate as their own entities, their decisions and actions can easily become opaque. Without robust governance, it becomes difficult to manage and almost impossible to insure against mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ali Sarrafi, CEO &amp;amp; Founder of Kovant, the answer is governed autonomy. “Well-designed agents with clear boundaries, policies and definitions managed the same way as an enterprise manages any worker can move fast on low-risk work inside clear guardrails, but escalate to humans when actions cross defined risk thresholds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With detailed action logs, observability, and human gatekeeping for high-impact decisions, agents stop being mysterious bots and become systems you can inspect, audit, and trust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Deloitte’s report suggests, AI agent adoption is set to accelerate in the coming years, and only the companies that deploy the technology with visibility and control will hold the upper hand over competitors, not those who deploy them quickest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Why AI agents require robust guardrails&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI agents may perform well in controlled demos, but they struggle in real-world business settings where systems can be fragmented and data may be inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarrafi commented on the unpredictable nature of AI agents in these scenarios. “When an agent is given too much context or scope at once, it becomes prone to hallucinations and unpredictable behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By contrast, production-grade systems limit the decision and context scope that models work with. They decompose operations into narrower, focused tasks for individual agents, making behaviour more predictable and easier to control. This structure also enables traceability and intervention, so failures can be detected early and escalated appropriately rather than causing cascading errors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Accountability for insurable AI&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With agents taking real actions in business systems, such as keeping detailed action logs, risk and compliance are viewed differently. With every action recorded, agents’ activities become clear and evaluable, letting organisations inspect actions in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such transparency is crucial for insurers, who are reluctant to cover opaque AI systems. This level of detail helps insurers understand what agents have done, and the controls involved, thus making it easier to assess risk. With human oversight for risk-critical actions and auditable, replayable workflows, organisations can produce systems that are more manageable for risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;AAIF standards a good first step&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared standards, like those being developed by the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), help businesses to integrate different agent systems, but current standardisation efforts focus on what is simplest to build, not what larger organisations need to operate agentic systems safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarrafi says enterprises require standards that support operation control, and which include, “access permissions, approval workflows for high-impact actions, and auditable logs and observability, so teams can monitor behaviour, investigate incidents, and prove compliance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Identity and permissions the first line of defence&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting what AI agents can access and the actions they can perform is important to ensure safety in real business environments. Sarrafi said, “When agents are given broad privileges or too much context, they become unpredictable and pose security or compliance risks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visibility and monitoring are important to keep agents operating inside limits. Only then can stakeholders have confidence in the adoption of the technology. If every action is logged and manageable, teams can then see what has happened, identify issues, and better understand why events occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarrafi continued, “This visibility, combined with human supervision where it matters, turns AI agents from inscrutable components into systems that can be inspected, replayed and audited. It also allows rapid investigation and correction when issues arise, which boosts trust among operators, risk teams and insurers alike.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Deloitte’s blueprint&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deloitte’s strategy for safe AI agent governance sets out defined boundaries for the decisions agentic systems can make. For instance, they might operate with tiered autonomy, where agents can only view information or offer suggestions. From here, they can be allowed to take limited actions, but with human approval. Once they have proven to be reliable in low-risk areas, they can be allowed to act automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deloitte’s “Cyber AI Blueprints” suggest governance layers and embedding policies and compliance capability roadmaps into organisational controls. Ultimately, governance structures that track AI use and risk, and embedding oversight into daily operations are important for safe agentic AI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readying workforces with training is another aspect of safe governance. Deloitte recommends training employees on what they shouldn’t share with AI systems, what to do if agents go off track, and how to spot unusual, potentially dangerous behaviour. If employees fail to understand how AI systems work and their potential risks, they may weaken security controls, albeit unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robust governance and control, alongside shared literacy are fundamental to the safe deployment and operation of AI agents, enabling secure, compliant, and accountable performance in real-world environments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Global Hawk, NASA’s New Remote-Controlled Plane” by NASA Goddard Photo and Video is licensed under CC BY 2.0. )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

But just as LLMs speed up the coding process, the old problems of hosting, security, and general DevOps problems have persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s an obvious business opportunity in solving that problem, but with the system changing so quickly, it’s hard to know how to grab hold of it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the more interesting answers comes from Modelence, a Y Combinator startup from this summer’s batch that announced on Wednesday it raised $3 million seed round. Y Combinator led the round, with participation from Rebel Fund, Acacia Venture Capital Partners, Formosa VC and Vocal Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Modelence isn’t the only company going after this sector. Giants like Google and Amazon as well as smaller startups like&amp;nbsp;Shuttle are all trying to solve the infrastructure issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California-based Modelence stands out for how its diagnosing the problem. For CEO Aram Shatakhtsyan, the issue isn’t individual services; it’s the connections between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You don’t want to ask AI to go build authentication and then set up a database and then connect them together, because it’s very likely to break,” Shatakhtsyan told TechCrunch in a recent interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s an interesting diagnosis because it explains how there can be so many world-class service providers contributing to such a rickety system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Vercel covers most of your front end, and Supabase covers the database and the layer on top of it. But you still have to stitch the rest of it together,” he said explaining the various products software engineers use today. “In the best case, you get two cloud systems.” In short, there is a lot of room to make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

But with the release of Apple’s new Creator Studio Pro suite, available to the public on Wednesday, the tech giant has approached the addition of AI as a tool that aids in the creator process, but doesn’t attempt to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead, Apple lays out a vision that suggests the productivity suite of the future is the one that focuses on the needs of creators — whether that’s filmmakers, musicians, artists, or anyone else enmeshed in a creative industry of some kind — and empowers them to be more efficient using AI. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s tricky to bring AI into the world of creativity, given the backlash and even legal action from creators who are angry about AI models training on their works, then reproducing similar art or creative content in the AI systems’ output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084115" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-Creator-Studio-lifestyle-Final-Cut-Pro.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple, however, sees AI as a tool that handles more of the basics and tedious tasks — like generating a slideshow for you to edit from your notes, extracting chord information from a song, searching across hours of video footage for the clip you need, changing the camera angle on your images, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tools in Creator Studio Pro are not new, but they’ve never been packaged as a subscription product, which is now available at $12.99 per month or $129 per year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084122" height="455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-Creator-Studio-Final-Cut-Pro-Transcript-Search.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Included in the subscription are Final Cut Pro, Motion, and Compressor for video editing; Logic Pro and Mainstage for music creation; image editing tool Pixelmator Pro; and a set of exclusive features in Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform. The suite also includes the newly launched Pixelmator Pro app for iPad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Apple’s traditional productivity software applications haven’t caught up to those from Google and Microsoft, the tech giant has always found more success in the creative fields. And with the addition of AI features, the company likely sees the possibility of making its creative software more accessible to those who aren’t fully professionals – like an indie musician or artist who wants to improve their marketing and sales, those who quickly compile video footage to post on social media, or those who want to create music or art and edit the output.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whether Apple’s tools are the right ones for the job compared with Adobe products will depend on the user’s specific needs and their familiarity with professional creative tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Each tool in the suite has received its own series of upgrades timed with this launch, both AI and otherwise. Notable additions include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Cut Pro:&lt;/strong&gt; AI-powered transcript search for finding the right soundbite across hours of footage; AI-powered visual search assistant, allowing users to search for an object or action to add to their timeline; beat detection to edit to the rhythm of music, which uses an AI model to analyze music tracks; a new Montage Maker on iPad for easily making highlight videos from footage; multiple selection support for batch edits, background export, and external monitor playback on iPad; access to content to enhance videos, like graphics, dynamic titles and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084128" height="455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-Creator-Studio-Final-Cut-Pro-Beat-Detection.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logic Pro:&lt;/strong&gt; A new synth player feature, built from performances, adds a virtual Session Player that can play synth keyboard and bass parts; Chord ID, which uses AI to analyze audio to extract chord information; sound packs and producer packs come to the Mac with the expansion of the Sound Library; the iPad app also gets new features like Quick Swipe Comping to assemble recordings in different ways than were captured, and an AI-powered understanding of the loop library for finding the right sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084112" height="455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-Creator-Studio-Logic-Pro-Chord-ID.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pixelmator Pro for Mac and iPad: &lt;/strong&gt;The app, which is now available on iPad, already offers a number of AI features like those to upscale images (Super Resolution), offer composition suggestions (Auto Crop), remove artifacts, retouch, and more. With the Creator Suite launch, the app gets a new Liquid Glass design to match the rest of Apple’s software, a new Warp tool for reshaping layers, and Warp-powered mockups to preview designs for apparel or other products in real-world imagery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084105" height="514" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-Creator-Studio-Pixelmator-Layers-sidebar.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform:&lt;/strong&gt; These general-purpose productivity apps are gaining new features for Creator Studio subscribers, including new premium templates and themes in Keynote, Pages, and Numbers, and an image and graphic library across all four apps, dubbed the Content Hub; an AI-powered image generation and remixing feature lets creators pick from prebuilt configuration options to change the style, orientation, or camera angle for their photos, graphics, icons, or other visual concept; other AI tools can enhance images (using the Super Resolution feature) or make composition suggestions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084119" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-Creator-Studio-Keynote-Content-Hub.png?w=547" width="547" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keynote&lt;/strong&gt;, specifically, adds several AI features, including a new tool that uses your text notes as a starting point to create a slideshow from scratch; AI can also generate your presenter notes and clean up your slide content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084116" height="464" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-Creator-Studio-Keynote-Presenter-Notes.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;, meanwhile, can use AI to analyze patterns in your spreadsheet data and make suggestions for table contents (Magic Fill). It can also generate a formula to describe what it generated, so you can learn how it works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple says it will continue to offer its creativity apps as standalone downloads, and existing users will still get updates, including these new features. Meanwhile, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform will remain free apps, but the new, premium features will be locked behind the subscription. It’s an interesting choice to allow users to choose to purchase apps outright, as before, as that differentiates Apple’s offering from others, like Adobe. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Apple lets users share their apps through Family Sharing with up to five family members, which Adobe doesn’t offer. Users can also cancel their subscription at any time, without penalty. However, Adobe remains a fierce competitor with its expansive and detailed tools, which also run on iOS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some of the AI features are powered by Apple Intelligence, like the visual and transcript search in Final Cut Pro, which runs locally on the device. Others involve the use of third parties, like OpenAI, which powers things like advanced image generation, Keynote slides, and presenter notes. Creator Studio’s AI features either are processed on the device or use a private relay to anonymize the traffic. Apple says these protections mean users’ content is kept private and never used for AI training.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Generative AI apps that can create photos, videos, songs, and more are growing in popularity.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple says it will continue to offer its creativity apps as standalone downloads, and existing users will still get updates, including these new features. Meanwhile, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform will remain free apps, but the new, premium features will be locked behind the subscription. It’s an interesting choice to allow users to choose to purchase apps outright, as before, as that differentiates Apple’s offering from others, like Adobe. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Apple lets users share their apps through Family Sharing with up to five family members, which Adobe doesn’t offer. Users can also cancel their subscription at any time, without penalty. However, Adobe remains a fierce competitor with its expansive and detailed tools, which also run on iOS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some of the AI features are powered by Apple Intelligence, like the visual and transcript search in Final Cut Pro, which runs locally on the device. Others involve the use of third parties, like OpenAI, which powers things like advanced image generation, Keynote slides, and presenter notes. Creator Studio’s AI features either are processed on the device or use a private relay to anonymize the traffic. Apple says these protections mean users’ content is kept private and never used for AI training.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/with-apples-new-creator-studio-pro-ai-is-a-tool-to-aid-creation-not-replace-it/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:04:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Report: China approves import of high-end Nvidia AI chips after weeks of uncertainty (AI - Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/report-china-approves-import-of-high-end-nvidia-ai-chips-after-weeks-of-uncertainty/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, China approved imports of Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence chips for three of its largest technology companies, Reuters reported. ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent received approval to purchase more than 400,000 H200 chips in total, marking a shift in Beijing’s stance after weeks of holding up shipments despite US export clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move follows Beijing’s temporary halt to H200 shipments earlier this month after Washington cleared exports on January 13. Chinese customs authorities had told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month, even as Chinese technology companies placed orders for more than two million of the chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H200, Nvidia’s second most powerful AI chip after the B200, delivers roughly six times the performance of the company’s H20 chip, which was previously the most capable chip Nvidia could sell to China. While Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the H20’s performance, they still lag far behind the H200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese tech giants want access to Nvidia’s higher-powered AI chips because they dramatically speed up the process of training large AI models, a computationally intensive task of feeding data through neural networks millions of times to tune their performance. More capable chips like the H200 allow companies to train larger models faster or run more AI queries (called inference) at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has made high-end AI accelerator chips a flashpoint in the ongoing AI race between Washington, DC, and Beijing, with US policymakers caught between wanting to boost sales for American semiconductor companies and fearing that exports could help China close the gap in AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Still, Nvidia wants the business because China is a huge market. The latest approvals came during Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s visit to China this week, according to sources who spoke with Reuters on the condition of anonymity. Other Chinese firms are now waiting for their own approvals in future rounds, though Beijing is attaching conditions to the licenses that have not yet been finalized. One source told Reuters that the license terms were too restrictive and buyers had not yet turned their approvals into actual orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beijing’s balancing act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approval signals Beijing’s prioritization of its major Internet companies, which are spending billions of dollars to build data centers needed to develop AI services and compete with US rivals, including OpenAI. But regulators are also trying to nurture China’s domestic semiconductor industry, the South China Morning Post reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first batch was expected to go to Big Tech companies in urgent need of the GPU, according to a source who spoke with that publication. However, access for state-backed firms, including telecom operators, was expected to stay tightly restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing has previously discouraged domestic technology companies from purchasing foreign chips unless absolutely needed, according to earlier Reuters reporting. One proposal authorities discussed in the past would require each H200 purchase to be bundled with a set ratio of domestic chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beijing’s approval of the H200 is driven by purely strategic motives,” Alex Capri, a senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore’s business school, told the South China Morning Post. “Ultimately, this decision is taken to further China’s indigenous capabilities and, by extension, the competitive capabilities of China tech.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But tiny 30-person startup Arcee AI disagrees. The company just released a truly and permanently open (Apache license) general-purpose, foundation model called Trinity, and Arcee claims that at 400B parameters, it is among the largest open-source foundation models ever trained and released by a U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Arcee says Trinity compares to Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick 400B, and Z.ai GLM-4.5, a high-performing open-source model from China’s Tsinghua University, according to benchmark tests conducted using base models (very little post training).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Arcee AI benchmarks for Trinity LLM" class="wp-image-3086962" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Arcee AI benchmarks for its Trinity large LLM (preview version, base model)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Arcee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, Trinity is geared for coding and multi-step processes like agents. Still, despite its size, it’s not a true SOTA competitor yet because it currently supports only text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More modes are in the works — a vision model is currently in development, and a speech-to-text version is on the roadmap, CTO Lucas Atkins told TechCrunch (pictured above, on the left). In comparison, Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick is already multi-modal, supporting text and images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But before adding more AI modes to its roster, Arcee says, it wanted a base LLM that would impress its main target customers: developers and academics. The team particularly wants to woo U.S. companies of all sizes away from choosing open models from China.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ultimately, the winners of this game, and the only way to really win over the usage, is to have the best open-weight model,” Atkins said. “To win the hearts and minds of developers, you have to give them the best.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The benchmarks show that the Trinity base model, currently in preview while more post-training takes place, is largely holding its own and, in some cases, slightly besting Llama on tests of coding and math, common sense, knowledge and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The progress Arcee has made so far to become a competitive AI Lab is impressive. The large Trinity model follows two previous small models released in in December: the 26B-parameter Trinity Mini, a fully post-trained reasoning model for tasks ranging from web apps to agents, and the 6B-parameter Trinity Nano, an experimental model designed to push the boundaries of models that are tiny yet chatty.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The kicker is, Arcee trained them all in six months for $20 million total, using 2,048 Nvidia Blackwell B300 GPUs. This out of the roughly $50 million the company has raised so far, said founder and CEO Mark McQuade (pictured above, on the right).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That kind of cash was “a lot for us,” said Atkins, who led the model building effort. Still, he acknowledged that it pales in comparison to how much bigger labs are spending right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The six-month timeline “was very calculated,” said Atkins, whose career before LLMs involved building voice agents for cars. “We are a younger startup that’s extremely hungry. We have a tremendous amount of talent and bright young researchers who, when given the opportunity to spend this amount of money and train a model of this size, we trusted that they’d rise to the occasion. And they certainly did, with many sleepless nights, many long hours.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;McQuade, previously an early employee at open-source model marketplace HuggingFace, says Arcee didn’t start out wanting to become a new U.S. AI Lab:&amp;nbsp;The company was originally doing model customization for large enterprise clients like SK Telecom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We were only doing post-training. So we would take the great work of others: We would take a Llama model, we would take a Mistral model, we would take a Qwen model that was open source, and we would post-train it to make it better” for a company’s intended use, he said, including doing the reinforcement learning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But as their client list grew, Atkins said, the need for their own model was becoming a necessity, and McQuade was worried about relying on other companies. At the same time, many of the best open models were coming from China, which U.S. enterprises were leery of, or were barred from using.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was a nerve-wracking decision. “I think there’s less than 20 companies in the world that have ever pre-trained and released their own model” at the size and level that Arcee was gunning for, McQuade said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company started small at first, trying its hand at a tiny, 4.5B model created in partnership with training company DatologyAI. The project’s success then encouraged bigger endeavors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But if the U.S. already has Llama, why does it need another open weight model? Atkins says by choosing the open source Apache license, the startup is committed to always keeping its models open. This comes after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last year indicated his company might not always make all of its most advanced models open source.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Llama can be looked at as not truly open source as it uses a Meta-controlled license with commercial and usage caveats,” he says. This has caused some open source organizations to claim that Llama isn’t open source compliant at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Arcee exists because the U.S. needs a permanently open, Apache-licensed, frontier-grade alternative that can actually compete at today’s frontier,” McQuade said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All Trinity models, large and small, can be downloaded for free. The largest version will be released in three flavors. Trinity Large Preview is a lightly post-trained instruct model, meaning it’s been trained to follow human instructions, not just predict the next word, which gears it for general chat usage. Trinity Large Base&amp;nbsp;is the base model without post-training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then we have TrueBase,&amp;nbsp;a model with any instruct data or post training so enterprises or researchers that want to customize it won’t have to unroll any data, rules or assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Acree AI will eventually offer a hosted version of its general release model for, it says, competitive API pricing. That release is up to six weeks away as the startup continues to improve the model’s reasoning training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;API pricing for Trinity-Mini is $0.045 / $0.15, and there is a rate-limited&amp;nbsp;free tier available, too.&amp;nbsp;Meanwhile, the company still sells post-training and customization options.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Many in the industry think the winners of the AI model market have already been decided: Big Tech will own it (Google, Meta, Microsoft, a bit of Amazon) along with their model makers of choice, largely OpenAI and Anthropic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But tiny 30-person startup Arcee AI disagrees. The company just released a truly and permanently open (Apache license) general-purpose, foundation model called Trinity, and Arcee claims that at 400B parameters, it is among the largest open-source foundation models ever trained and released by a U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Arcee says Trinity compares to Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick 400B, and Z.ai GLM-4.5, a high-performing open-source model from China’s Tsinghua University, according to benchmark tests conducted using base models (very little post training).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Arcee AI benchmarks for Trinity LLM" class="wp-image-3086962" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Arcee AI benchmarks for its Trinity large LLM (preview version, base model)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Arcee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, Trinity is geared for coding and multi-step processes like agents. Still, despite its size, it’s not a true SOTA competitor yet because it currently supports only text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More modes are in the works — a vision model is currently in development, and a speech-to-text version is on the roadmap, CTO Lucas Atkins told TechCrunch (pictured above, on the left). In comparison, Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick is already multi-modal, supporting text and images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But before adding more AI modes to its roster, Arcee says, it wanted a base LLM that would impress its main target customers: developers and academics. The team particularly wants to woo U.S. companies of all sizes away from choosing open models from China.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ultimately, the winners of this game, and the only way to really win over the usage, is to have the best open-weight model,” Atkins said. “To win the hearts and minds of developers, you have to give them the best.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now, Google is flexing its own AI muscles by adding similar features to Chrome, the world’s largest browser by market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Google had introduced Gemini to Chrome last September, the assistant lived in a floating window. With this update, the company will put its AI helper into a persistent sidebar, so you can ask questions about the current website or other open tabs.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One interesting feature Google demoed to press ahead of today’s launch involved multiple tabs. When you open different tabs from a single webpage, the Gemini sidebar understands them as a context group. This is helpful when you are comparing prices or different products you’re considering purchasing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087116" height="484" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Still_Gemini-in-Chrome-Side-Panel-1.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credit: Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before today, the Gemini in Chrome feature was available only to Windows and MacOS users. With this rollout, the sidebar will be available to Chromebook Plus users as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google is also taking advantage of its newly launched personal intelligence feature, which connects to your Gmail, Search, YouTube, and Google Photos accounts, allowing you to ask questions based on your own data. This feature will roll out in Chrome in the coming months, meaning that you can ask Gemini in the sidebar about things like your family’s schedule, or ask it to draft an email and send it without switching to Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s a new Nano Banana integration coming to Chrome, too, that allows you to modify an existing image with another image or product that you find while browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the most ambitious feature is called auto-browse, which aims to handle tasks for you by using your personal information and traversing websites on your behalf. For instance, you can ask the agentic feature to go to a particular website and buy an item for you, and find a discount coupon. The agent will ask for your intervention when performing data-sensitive tasks, such as logging into a website or making a final purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last year, the company explained that these features would use Chrome’s password manager or saved card details, but said its AI models wouldn’t be exposed to any of these details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This feature is rolling out initially to AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Browser-based agents are finicky and often fail to complete tasks. Google’s demo, just like tons of other AI demos, involved shopping and travel planning. In real-world use cases, agents often don’t get the intent or break during traversing different sites, and that would be a challenge for wider adoption.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said that in its early testing, users have used the feature for tasks such as scheduling appointments, filling out tedious online forms, collecting their tax documents, getting quotes for plumbers and electricians, and filing expense reports.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Google began stuffing Gemini into its dominant Chrome browser several months ago, and today the AI is expanding its capabilities considerably. Google says the chatbot will be easier to access and connect to more Google services, but the biggest change is the addition of Google’s autonomous browsing agent, which it has dubbed Auto Browse. Similar to tools like OpenAI Atlas, Auto Browse can handle tedious tasks in Chrome so you don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly unveiled Gemini features in Chrome are accessible from the omnipresent AI button that has been lurking at the top of the window for the last few months. Initially, that button only opened Gemini in a pop-up window, but Google now says it will default to a split-screen or “Sidepanel” view. Google confirmed the update began rolling out over the past week, so you may already have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can still pop Gemini out into a floating window, but the split-view gives Gemini more room to breathe while manipulating a page with AI. This is also helpful when calling other apps in the Chrome implementation of Gemini. The chatbot can now access Gmail, Calendar, YouTube, Maps, Google Shopping, and Google Flights right from the Chrome window. Google technically added this feature around the middle of January, but it’s only talking about it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini in Chrome can now also access and edit images with Nano Banana, so you don’t have to download and re-upload them to Gemini in another location. Just open the image from the web and type in the Sidepanel with a description of the edits you want. Like in the Gemini app, you can choose between the slower but higher-quality Pro model and the faster standard one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Can’t someone else do it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome’s new browsing agent (in preview) is the star of today’s show. The promise of agentic AI is one of the freedom to be lazy. Rather than filling out forms or copying information from emails, you simply task a robot with the job and relax while it goes to work. At least, that’s how it’s supposed to go. Most of the computer-use agents we’ve seen so far have been sluggish and unreliable enough to require human supervision. That kind of defeats the purpose. Now it’s Google’s turn to show us what its browsing agent can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google says Auto Browse is based on its latest Gemini 3 models, with input from the company’s work on the experimental Project Mariner agent. If you’d do something with a keyboard and mouse inside your browser, Auto Browse is theoretically able to take over. It can also access the content and tabs in your browser, asking for permission when it needs sensitive data, such as your passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Apartment hunting with Auto Browse

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you launch an Auto Browse task, Chrome will open new tabs as necessary and mark them with a sparkly AI icon so you know where the robot is active. You don’t have to keep that tab in the foreground, and you can even have multiple AI tasks going at once. The AI will ping you to check in when the task is done or when it needs your input. However, there are limits on Auto Browse similar to some of the company’s more computationally intensive chatbot functions. AI Pro subscribers get 20 AI browsing tasks per day, but those paying for AI Ultra get 200 per day.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Having the AI churning in the background may be a concern—after all, generative AI can make mistakes, and you are giving it complete control over the browsing experience. Google says it has implemented a range of security and safety rules to prevent misuse. For example, if you ask Auto Browse to research and buy something, it won’t actually buy it. Instead, it will find the item (hopefully) and progress to the purchase screen before letting you pull the trigger manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="1080" id="video-2137804-3" preload="metadata" width="1920"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Animation_filling-form-from-PDF-1-opt.mp4?_=3" type="video/mp4" /&gt;Filling a form with Auto Browse&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Filling a form with Auto Browse

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to keep in mind is that Auto Browse doesn’t run locally. All content from your robotically operated tab is streamed to a cloud-based Gemini model. That means page content will be shared with Google, but the extent is not entirely clear. Google says Auto Browse is governed by the established Gemini in Chrome policy, which says Google stores information from websites in the Gemini Apps Activity (if Keep Activity is enabled). Page content is also “logged to your Google Account temporarily.” We asked if Google would use page contents processed by Auto Browse to further train AI models, but a spokesperson declined to provide specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome Auto Browse is rolling out today in preview, but it’s not exactly free. It won’t cost anything extra, but the feature is limited to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers. Google’s language suggests the feature may come to free users after the preview phase, but we’d expect strict usage limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the AI churning in the background may be a concern—after all, generative AI can make mistakes, and you are giving it complete control over the browsing experience. Google says it has implemented a range of security and safety rules to prevent misuse. For example, if you ask Auto Browse to research and buy something, it won’t actually buy it. Instead, it will find the item (hopefully) and progress to the purchase screen before letting you pull the trigger manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="1080" id="video-2137804-3" preload="metadata" width="1920"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Animation_filling-form-from-PDF-1-opt.mp4?_=3" type="video/mp4" /&gt;Filling a form with Auto Browse&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Filling a form with Auto Browse

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to keep in mind is that Auto Browse doesn’t run locally. All content from your robotically operated tab is streamed to a cloud-based Gemini model. That means page content will be shared with Google, but the extent is not entirely clear. Google says Auto Browse is governed by the established Gemini in Chrome policy, which says Google stores information from websites in the Gemini Apps Activity (if Keep Activity is enabled). Page content is also “logged to your Google Account temporarily.” We asked if Google would use page contents processed by Auto Browse to further train AI models, but a spokesperson declined to provide specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome Auto Browse is rolling out today in preview, but it’s not exactly free. It won’t cost anything extra, but the feature is limited to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers. Google’s language suggests the feature may come to free users after the preview phase, but we’d expect strict usage limits.&lt;/p&gt;
