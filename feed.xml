This is not about isolated pilots. It is about embedding AI into core operations, supported by modern infrastructure, strong data foundations, and disciplined governance,” said Chris Walters, CEO of Finastra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-experimentation-to-enterprise-ai-deployment"&gt;From experimentation to enterprise AI deployment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-112203" height="544" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-13-at-3.04.21-PM.png" width="897" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, 31% of institutions report scaled deployment across multiple functions, while 30% have achieved limited production deployment. A further 27% are piloting or testing in limited functions, with only 8% still in the exploration phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a fundamental shift in how AI deployment is approached within financial services. The technology is no longer confined to innovation labs or proof-of-concept projects but has become integral to core banking operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Singapore specifically, an additional 35% are piloting or researching AI applications beyond their current production deployments, indicating a robust innovation pipeline that positions the city-state as a regional AI leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary objectives driving this deployment vary by market. In Singapore and the US, 43% of institutions are using AI to improve compliance and regulatory processes—reflecting the technology’s ability to navigate increasingly complex oversight requirements while maintaining operational resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-112204" height="825" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-13-at-3.05.09-PM-1024x825.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, the top AI implementation objectives are improving accuracy and reducing errors (40%), increasing employee productivity (37%), and enhancing risk management capabilities (34%). Vietnam prioritises speed, with 49% using AI to accelerate processing in payments and lending services, while Mexico emphasises customer experience and personalisation at 43%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cloud-infrastructure-enables-ai-at-scale"&gt;Cloud infrastructure enables AI at scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singapore’s AI deployment success is underpinned by advanced cloud adoption. The research shows 55% of Singapore institutions host all or most infrastructure in the cloud, with a further 30% operating hybrid environments—an 85% total that significantly exceeds many global peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cloud-first approach provides the scalable, resilient infrastructure required for enterprise AI deployment. Without modern data architectures and elastic compute capabilities, AI remains confined to small-scale experiments that cannot deliver enterprise-wide value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between modernisation and AI deployment is clear in the data. Nearly nine in ten institutions (87%) globally plan to increase modernisation investment over the next 12 months, with Singapore leading in planned spending increases above 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Institutions also report strong confidence in their technology foundations, with 71% of Singapore respondents rating their core infrastructure, security and reliability ahead of peers—the highest globally and well above the 72% average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-spending-surges-as-ai-creates-new-threat-vectors"&gt;Security spending surges as AI creates new threat vectors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-112205" height="545" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-13-at-3.06.32-PM.png" width="722" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI deployment accelerates, so do AI-enabled security threats. The research projects a 40% average increase in security spending globally in 2026, with institutions responding to what 43% describe as constantly evolving risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singapore leads in deploying advanced fraud detection and transaction monitoring, with 62% having implemented or upgraded these systems in the past year. This compares to a 48% global average, underscoring the city-state’s recognition that AI-powered fraud requires AI-powered defences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, 60% of&amp;nbsp;Singapore&amp;nbsp;institutions have modernised their Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) capabilities—again the highest globally—enabling real-time threat monitoring and automated response at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-factor authentication and biometrics deployment reached 54% in Singapore, as institutions strengthen identity verification against increasingly sophisticated attack vectors that leverage generative AI and deepfake technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, API security and gateway hardening emerge as a key priority, cited by 34% globally as a focus area for the next 12 months. This reflects growing recognition that as ecosystems expand and AI systems interact across organisational boundaries, securing access points becomes paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-talent-shortages-emerge-as-the-primary-barrier"&gt;Talent shortages emerge as the primary barrier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite strong progress, barriers to AI deployment persist. Talent shortages top the list globally at 43%, but in Singapore this figure reaches 54%—the highest of any market surveyed and tied only with the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intense competition for specialised AI, cloud, and security expertise reflects the gap between institutional ambition and available human capital. Demand for professionals who can architect AI systems, ensure model governance, and integrate AI into existing workflows far outpaces supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budget constraints also weigh heavily, cited by 52% of Singapore institutions—again, the highest globally. Even well-funded organisations face difficult prioritisation decisions as they balance AI deployment, security investments, modernisation, and customer experience initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, 54% of institutions globally are partnering with fintech providers as their default approach to accessing AI capabilities without bearing the full burden of talent acquisition or system development. These partnerships allow organisations to accelerate AI deployment while maintaining control over critical data and compliance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research reveals a sector that has decisively crossed the AI adoption threshold but now faces the more complex challenge of scaling responsibly. As Walters noted, success will be defined not by the breadth of AI experiments but by the ability to embed intelligence into operations while strengthening rather than compromising trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study surveyed managers and executives from institutions across France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the UAE, the&amp;nbsp;UK, the&amp;nbsp;US and Vietnam, representing organisations that collectively manage over $100 trillion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Peter Nguyen)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: AI Expo 2026 Day 2: Moving experimental pilots to AI production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check outAI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The Chinese tech giant this week unveiled RynnBrain, an open-source model designed to help robots perceive their environment and execute physical tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move signals China’s accelerating push into physical AI as ageing populations and labour shortages drive demand for machines that can work alongside—or replace—humans. The model positions Alibaba alongside Nvidia, Google DeepMind, and Tesla in the race to build what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang calls “a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike its competitors, however, Alibaba is pursuing an open-source strategy—making RynnBrain freely available to developers to accelerate adoption, similar to its approach with the Qwen family of language models, which rank among China’s most advanced AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video demonstrations released by Alibaba’s DAMO Academy show RynnBrain-powered robots identifying fruit and placing it in baskets—tasks that seem simple but require complex AI governing object recognition and precise movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology falls under the category of vision-language-action (VLA) models, which integrate computer vision, natural language processing, and motor control to enable robots to interpret their surroundings and execute appropriate actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional robots that follow preprogrammed instructions, physical AI systems like RynnBrain enable machines to learn from experience and adapt behaviour in real time. This represents a fundamental shift from automation to autonomous decision-making in physical environments—a shift with implications extending far beyond factory floors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cmplz-placeholder-element twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;HUGE: Alibaba just launched "RynnBrain" an open-source AI model that lets robots see, think, and act in the real world, with the aim to steal market share from Google and Nvidia. pic.twitter.com/ULe3VcFlcE&lt;/p&gt;— AI Flash ⚡️ (@aiflash_) February 10, 2026&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-prototype-to-production"&gt;From prototype to production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing signals a broader inflexion point. According to Deloitte’s 2026 Tech Trends&amp;nbsp;report, physical AI has begun “shifting from a research timeline to an industrial one,” with simulation platforms and synthetic data generation compressing iteration cycles before real-world deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition is being driven less by technological breakthroughs than by economic necessity. Advanced economies face a stark reality: demand for production, logistics, and maintenance continues rising while labour supply increasingly fails to keep pace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OECD projects that working-age populations across developed nations will stagnate or decline over the coming decades as ageing accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of East Asia are encountering this reality earlier than other regions. Demographic ageing, declining fertility, and tightening labour markets are already influencing automation choices in logistics, manufacturing, and infrastructure—particularly in China, Japan, and South Korea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These environments aren’t exceptional; they’re simply ahead of a trajectory other advanced economies are likely to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to humanoid robots specifically—machines designed to walk and function like humans—China is “forging ahead of the U.S.,” with companies planning to ramp up production this year, according to Deloitte.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS estimates there will be two million humanoids in the workplace by 2035, climbing to 300 million by 2050, representing a total addressable market between $1.4 trillion and $1.7 trillion by mid-century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-governance-gap"&gt;The governance gap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet as physical AI capabilities accelerate, a critical constraint is emerging—one that has nothing to do with model performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In physical environments, failures cannot simply be patched after the fact,” according to a World Economic Forum&amp;nbsp;analysis&amp;nbsp;published this week. “Once AI begins to move goods, coordinate labour or operate equipment, the binding constraint shifts from what systems can do to how responsibility, authority and intervention are governed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical industries are governed by consequences, not computation. A flawed recommendation in a chatbot can be corrected in software. A robot that drops a part during handover or loses balance on a factory floor designed for humans causes operations to pause, creating cascading effects on production schedules, safety protocols, and liability chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WEF framework identifies three governance layers required for safe deployment: executive governance setting risk appetite and non-negotiables; system governance embedding those constraints into engineered reality through stop rules and change controls; and frontline governance giving workers clear authority to override AI decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As physical AI accelerates, technical capabilities will increasingly converge, but governance will not,” the analysis warns. “Those that treat governance as an afterthought may see early gains, but will discover that scale amplifies fragility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates an asymmetry in the US-China competition. China’s faster deployment cycles and willingness to pilot systems in controlled industrial environments could accelerate learning curves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, governance frameworks that work in structured factory settings may not translate to public spaces where autonomous systems must navigate unpredictable human behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-deployment-signals"&gt;Early deployment signals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current deployments remain concentrated in warehousing and logistics, where labour market pressures are most acute. Amazon recently deployed its millionth robot, part of a diverse fleet working alongside humans. Its DeepFleet AI model coordinates this massive robot army across the entire fulfilment network, which Amazon reports will improve travel efficiency by 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMW is testing humanoid robots at its South Carolina factory for tasks requiring dexterity that traditional industrial robots lack: precision manipulation, complex gripping, and two-handed coordination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The automaker is also using autonomous vehicle technology to enable newly built cars to drive themselves from the assembly line through testing to the finishing area, all without human assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But applications are expanding beyond traditional industrial settings. In healthcare, companies are developing AI-driven robotic surgery systems and intelligent assistants for patient care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cities like Cincinnati are deploying AI-powered drones to autonomously inspect bridge structures and road surfaces. Detroit has launched a free autonomous shuttle service for seniors and people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regional competitive dynamic intensified this week when South Korea announced a $692 million national initiative to produce AI semiconductors, underscoring how physical AI deployment requires not just software capabilities but domestic chip manufacturing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA has released multiple models under its “Cosmos” brand for training and running AI in robotics. Google DeepMind offers Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5. Tesla is developing its own AI to power the Optimus humanoid robot. Each company is betting that the convergence of AI capabilities with physical manipulation will unlock new categories of automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As simulation environments improve and ecosystem-based learning shortens deployment cycles, the strategic question is shifting from “Can we adopt physical AI?” to “Can we govern it at scale?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For China, the answer may determine whether its early mover advantage in robotics deployment translates into sustained industrial leadership—or becomes a cautionary tale about scaling systems faster than the governance infrastructure required to sustain them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Alibaba)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: EY and NVIDIA to help companies test and deploy physical AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check outAI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Demographic ageing, declining fertility, and tightening labour markets are already influencing automation choices in logistics, manufacturing, and infrastructure—particularly in China, Japan, and South Korea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These environments aren’t exceptional; they’re simply ahead of a trajectory other advanced economies are likely to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to humanoid robots specifically—machines designed to walk and function like humans—China is “forging ahead of the U.S.,” with companies planning to ramp up production this year, according to Deloitte.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS estimates there will be two million humanoids in the workplace by 2035, climbing to 300 million by 2050, representing a total addressable market between $1.4 trillion and $1.7 trillion by mid-century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-governance-gap"&gt;The governance gap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet as physical AI capabilities accelerate, a critical constraint is emerging—one that has nothing to do with model performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In physical environments, failures cannot simply be patched after the fact,” according to a World Economic Forum&amp;nbsp;analysis&amp;nbsp;published this week. “Once AI begins to move goods, coordinate labour or operate equipment, the binding constraint shifts from what systems can do to how responsibility, authority and intervention are governed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical industries are governed by consequences, not computation. A flawed recommendation in a chatbot can be corrected in software. A robot that drops a part during handover or loses balance on a factory floor designed for humans causes operations to pause, creating cascading effects on production schedules, safety protocols, and liability chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WEF framework identifies three governance layers required for safe deployment: executive governance setting risk appetite and non-negotiables; system governance embedding those constraints into engineered reality through stop rules and change controls; and frontline governance giving workers clear authority to override AI decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As physical AI accelerates, technical capabilities will increasingly converge, but governance will not,” the analysis warns. “Those that treat governance as an afterthought may see early gains, but will discover that scale amplifies fragility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates an asymmetry in the US-China competition. China’s faster deployment cycles and willingness to pilot systems in controlled industrial environments could accelerate learning curves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, governance frameworks that work in structured factory settings may not translate to public spaces where autonomous systems must navigate unpredictable human behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-deployment-signals"&gt;Early deployment signals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current deployments remain concentrated in warehousing and logistics, where labour market pressures are most acute. Amazon recently deployed its millionth robot, part of a diverse fleet working alongside humans. Its DeepFleet AI model coordinates this massive robot army across the entire fulfilment network, which Amazon reports will improve travel efficiency by 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMW is testing humanoid robots at its South Carolina factory for tasks requiring dexterity that traditional industrial robots lack: precision manipulation, complex gripping, and two-handed coordination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The automaker is also using autonomous vehicle technology to enable newly built cars to drive themselves from the assembly line through testing to the finishing area, all without human assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But applications are expanding beyond traditional industrial settings. In healthcare, companies are developing AI-driven robotic surgery systems and intelligent assistants for patient care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cities like Cincinnati are deploying AI-powered drones to autonomously inspect bridge structures and road surfaces. Detroit has launched a free autonomous shuttle service for seniors and people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regional competitive dynamic intensified this week when South Korea announced a $692 million national initiative to produce AI semiconductors, underscoring how physical AI deployment requires not just software capabilities but domestic chip manufacturing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA has released multiple models under its “Cosmos” brand for training and running AI in robotics. Google DeepMind offers Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5. Tesla is developing its own AI to power the Optimus humanoid robot. Each company is betting that the convergence of AI capabilities with physical manipulation will unlock new categories of automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As simulation environments improve and ecosystem-based learning shortens deployment cycles, the strategic question is shifting from “Can we adopt physical AI?” to “Can we govern it at scale?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For China, the answer may determine whether its early mover advantage in robotics deployment translates into sustained industrial leadership—or becomes a cautionary tale about scaling systems faster than the governance infrastructure required to sustain them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Alibaba)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: EY and NVIDIA to help companies test and deploy physical AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check outAI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.”&lt;/strong&gt; “The best thing you could do is eliminate out everything except fatty meat and lard,” Anthony Chaffee, an MD with almost 400,000 followers, said in an Instagram post.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And I almost choked on my broccoli&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;when, while scrolling LinkedIn, I came across an interview with another doctor declaring that “there is zero scientific evidence to say that vegetables are required in the human diet.” That doctor, who described himself as “90% carnivore,” went on to say that all he’d eaten the previous day was a kilo of beef, and that vegetables have “anti-nutrients,” whatever they might be.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;You don’t have to spend much time on social media to come across claims like this. The “traditionalist” influencer, author, and psychologist Jordan Peterson was promoting a meat-only diet as far back as 2018. A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that the most diet information is shared on Instagram and YouTube, and that a lot of it is nonsense. So much so that the authors describe it as a “growing public health concern.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies&lt;/strong&gt;. In January Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services, told a USA Today reporter that he was on a carnivore diet. “I only eat meat or fermented foods,” he said. He went on to say that the diet had helped him lose “40% of [his] visceral fat within a month.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Government needs to stop spreading misinformation that natural and saturated fats are bad for you,” Food and Drug Administration commissioner Martin Makary argued in a recent podcast interview. The principles of “whole foods and clean meats” are “biblical,” he said. The interviewer said that Makary’s warnings about pesticides made him want to “avoid all salads and completely miss the organic section in the grocery store.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the record: There’s plenty of evidence that a diet high in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s not government misinformation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The carnivore doctors’ suggestion to avoid vegetables is wrong too, says Gabby Headrick, associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety &amp;amp; Nutrition Security. There’s no evidence to suggest that a meat-only diet is good for you. “All of the nutrition science to date strongly identifies a wide array of vegetables … as being very health-promoting,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To be fair to the influencers out there, diet is a tricky thing to study. Much of the research into nutrition relies on volunteers to keep detailed and honest food diaries—something that people are generally quite bad at. And the way our bodies respond to foods might be influenced by our genetics, our microbiomes, the way we prepare or consume those foods, and who knows what else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Still, it will come as a surprise to no one that there is plenty of what the above study calls “low-quality content” floating around on social media.&lt;/strong&gt; So it’s worth arming ourselves with a good dose of skepticism, especially when we come across posts that mention “miracle foods” or extreme, limited diets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The truth is that most food is neither good nor bad when eaten in moderation. Diet trends come and go, and for most people, the best reasonable advice is simply to eat a balanced diet low in sugar, salt, and saturated fat. You know—the basics. No matter what that weird upside-down food pyramid implies. To the carnivore influencers, I say: get your misinformation off my broccoli.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

It is the quiet machinery that runs the organisation itself. Human resources, with its mix of routine workflows, compliance needs, and large volumes of structured data, is emerging as one of the earliest areas where companies are pushing AI into day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift is visible in how large employers are rethinking workforce systems. The telecommunications group e&amp;amp; began moving its human resources operations to what it describes as an AI-first model, covering roughly 10,000 employees across its organisation. The transition is built on Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM), running in an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure dedicated region. Details of the deployment were outlined in a recent Oracle announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change is less about introducing a single AI feature and more about restructuring how HR processes are handled. Automated and AI-driven tools are expected to help HR departments with recruitment screening, interview coordination, and employee learning recommendations. The stated goal is to standardise processes across regions and provide managers with faster access to workforce data and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hr-as-an-enterprise-ai-proving-ground"&gt;HR as an enterprise AI proving ground&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an enterprise perspective, HR is a logical entry point. Many HR tasks follow repeatable patterns: candidate matching, onboarding documentation, leave management, and training assignments. These workflows produce consistent data trails, which makes them easier to model and automate than loosely defined knowledge work. Moving such functions onto AI-supported systems allows organisations to test reliability, governance, and user acceptance in a controlled environment before expanding into more sensitive areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure choice also indicates how enterprises are balancing innovation with compliance. Oracle claims that the system is deployed in a dedicated cloud region designed to address data sovereignty and regulatory requirements. For multinational corporations, workforce data sits at the intersection of privacy law, employment regulation, and corporate governance. Running AI tools in a controlled environment is part of how companies are trying to contain risk while experimenting with automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-governance-compliance-and-internal-risk-management"&gt;Governance, compliance, and internal risk management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The e&amp;amp; rollout reflects a broader pattern in enterprise AI adoption: internal transformation is often more achievable than external disruption. Customer-facing AI systems attract attention, but they introduce reputational and operational risk if they fail. HR platforms, by contrast, operate behind the scenes. Errors can still carry consequences, yet they are easier to monitor, audit, and correct within existing governance structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry research supports the idea that internal operations are becoming a primary testing ground. Deloitte’s 2026 State of AI in the Enterprise report found that organisations are increasingly shifting AI projects from pilot stages into production environments, with productivity and workflow automation cited as early areas of return. The report is based on a survey of more than 3,000 senior leaders involved in AI initiatives, including respondents in Southeast Asia. While the study spans multiple business functions, administrative and operational processes were repeatedly identified as practical entry points for scaled deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workforce systems also provide a natural setting for AI agents and assistants. HR teams handle frequent employee queries about policies, benefits, and training options. Embedding conversational tools into these workflows may reduce manual workload while giving employees faster access to information. According to Oracle’s description of the deployment, e&amp;amp; plans to introduce digital assistants designed to support candidate engagement and employee development tasks. Whether such tools deliver consistent value will depend on accuracy, oversight, and how well they integrate with existing HR processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scaling-ai-inside-the-organisation"&gt;Scaling AI inside the organisation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson is not that HR automation is new, but that AI is changing the scope of what can be automated. Traditional HR software focused on record-keeping and workflow management. AI layers add predictive matching, pattern analysis, and decision support. That expansion raises familiar governance questions: data quality, bias, auditability, and employee trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a workforce dimension. Automating parts of HR does not eliminate the need for human oversight; it changes where effort is concentrated. HR professionals may spend less time on routine coordination and more on policy interpretation, employee engagement, and exception handling. Enterprises adopting AI-driven systems will need clear escalation paths and review processes to avoid over-reliance on automated outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the current moment different is scale. Deployments that cover thousands of employees turn AI from an experiment into operational infrastructure. They force organisations to confront issues of reliability, training, and change management in real time. The systems must work consistently across jurisdictions, languages, and regulatory frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As enterprises look for low-risk entry points into AI, workforce operations are likely to remain high on the list. They combine structured data, repeatable workflows, and measurable outcomes — conditions that suit automation while still allowing room for human judgement. The experience of early adopters will shape how quickly other internal functions, from finance to procurement, follow a similar path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Zulfugar Karimov)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Barclays bets on AI to cut costs and boost returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check outAI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Embedding conversational tools into these workflows may reduce manual workload while giving employees faster access to information. According to Oracle’s description of the deployment, e&amp;amp; plans to introduce digital assistants designed to support candidate engagement and employee development tasks. Whether such tools deliver consistent value will depend on accuracy, oversight, and how well they integrate with existing HR processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scaling-ai-inside-the-organisation"&gt;Scaling AI inside the organisation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson is not that HR automation is new, but that AI is changing the scope of what can be automated. Traditional HR software focused on record-keeping and workflow management. AI layers add predictive matching, pattern analysis, and decision support. That expansion raises familiar governance questions: data quality, bias, auditability, and employee trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a workforce dimension. Automating parts of HR does not eliminate the need for human oversight; it changes where effort is concentrated. HR professionals may spend less time on routine coordination and more on policy interpretation, employee engagement, and exception handling. Enterprises adopting AI-driven systems will need clear escalation paths and review processes to avoid over-reliance on automated outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the current moment different is scale. Deployments that cover thousands of employees turn AI from an experiment into operational infrastructure. They force organisations to confront issues of reliability, training, and change management in real time. The systems must work consistently across jurisdictions, languages, and regulatory frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As enterprises look for low-risk entry points into AI, workforce operations are likely to remain high on the list. They combine structured data, repeatable workflows, and measurable outcomes — conditions that suit automation while still allowing room for human judgement. The experience of early adopters will shape how quickly other internal functions, from finance to procurement, follow a similar path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Zulfugar Karimov)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Barclays bets on AI to cut costs and boost returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check outAI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. At the same time, he defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;/em&gt; profile of O’Neill last year, people working in health policy and consumer advocacy said they found his libertarian views on drug regulation “worrisome” and “antithetical to basic public health.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He was later named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting him in charge of the nation’s public health agency.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope O’Neill will bring attention and funding to their cause: the search for treatments that might slow, prevent, or even reverse human aging. Here are some takeaways from the interview.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vaccine recommendations could change further&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last month, the US cut the number of vaccines recommended for children. The CDC no longer recommends vaccinations against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, or meningococcal disease for all children. The move was widely panned by medical groups and public health experts. Many worry it will become more difficult for children to access those vaccines. The majority of states have rejected the recommendations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In the confirmation hearing for his role as deputy secretary of health and human services, which took place in May last year, O’Neill said he supported the CDC’s vaccine schedule. &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; asked him if that was the case and, if so, what made him change his mind. “Researching and examining and reviewing safety data and efficacy data about vaccines is one of CDC’s obligations,” he said. “CDC gives important advice about vaccines and should always be open to new data and new ways of looking at data.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the beginning of December, O’Neill said, President Donald Trump “asked me to look at what other countries were doing in terms of their vaccine schedules.” He said he spoke to health ministries of other countries and consulted with scientists at the CDC and FDA. “It was suggested to me by lots of the operating divisions that the US focus its recommendations on consensus vaccines of other developed nations—in other words, the most important vaccines that are most often part of the core recommendations of other countries,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“As a result of that, we did an update to the vaccine schedule to focus on a set of vaccines that are most important for all children.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But some experts in public health have said that countries like Denmark and Japan, whose vaccine schedules the new US one was supposedly modeled on, are not really comparable to the US. When asked about these criticisms, O’Neill replied, “A lot of parents feel that … more than 70 vaccine doses given to young children sounds like a really high number, and some of them ask which ones are the most important. I think we helped answer that question in a way that didn’t remove anyone’s access.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few weeks after the vaccine recommendations were changed, Kirk Milhoan, who leads the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that vaccinations for measles and polio—which are currently required for entry to public schools—should be optional. (Mehmet Oz, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services director, has more recently urged people to “take the [measles] vaccine.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“CDC still recommends that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), for which there is international consensus, as well as varicella (chickenpox),” he said when asked for his thoughts on this comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He also said that current vaccine guidelines are “still subject to new data coming in, new ways of thinking about things.” “CDC, FDA, and NIH are initiating new studies of the safety of immunizations,” he added. “We will continue to ask the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review evidence and make updated recommendations with rigorous science and transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;More support for longevity—but not all science&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill said he wants longevity to become a priority for US health agencies. His ultimate goal, he said, is to “make the damage of aging something that’s under medical control.” It’s “the same way of thinking” as the broader Make America Healthy Again approach, he said: “‘Again’ implies restoration of health, which is what longevity research and therapy is all about.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;O’Neill said his interest in longevity was ignited by his friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, around 2008 to 2009. It was right around the time O’Neill was finishing up a previous role in HHS, under the Bush administration. O’Neill said Thiel told him he “should really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.” “I just got more and more excited about that idea,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When asked if he’s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for “hardcore” longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O’Neill replied: “Yes.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including “Death is humanity’s core problem,” “Obviating aging is scientifically plausible,” and “I will carry the message against aging and death.” O’Neill said he agrees with all of them. “I suppose I am [a Vitalist],” he said with a smile, although he’s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. “If I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it’s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,” he said. “We are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: “You’ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people’s health.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Watch ARPA-H for news on organ replacements and more&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He promised we’ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting “high-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill said that “ARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.” The agency has a new director—Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women’s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;O’Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean Hébert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack’s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert’s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. “I would try it … Not today, but … if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We’re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;He’s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. “Someday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients’ own cells,” O’Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. “I’m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Longevity lobbyists have a friendly ear&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O’Neill said he hasn’t formally worked with them but thinks that “they’re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livingston has told me that A4LI’s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious—the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. “I would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,” he said. There’ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won’t say more for now.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It's a concept that O’Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building “freedom cities”—a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Próspera, a private city within a Honduran “special economic zone,” where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana’s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O’Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him “once or twice a year.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading—building new “startup countries” at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2009, O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that “the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.” When asked if he still thinks that’s the case, he said: “It’s not quite 2030, so I think it’s too soon to say … What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;We might expect more nutrition advice&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O’Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to “eat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,” echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O’Neill: “We’re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.” Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify “the healthiest fats,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Stay tuned.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jim-ONeill2.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 chronoton/executive-summary_0"&gt;&lt;div class="chronotonExecutiveSummary__summaryContainer--3bc10da0658ecd8e2ef22c6023461fb5"&gt;&lt;button class="chronotonExecutiveSummary__toggleButton--1cd6118db37e8a8252fc4cd8bbadcb85" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="chronotonExecutiveSummary__toggleText--a713e14989fe65c5162db2b69cb422c9"&gt;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg class="chronotonExecutiveSummary__toggleArrow--a8c1be9c06a9f066a767b3af80d859a1" fill="none" height="7" viewBox="0 0 11 7" width="11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;path d="M1 1L5.5 5.5L10 1" stroke="#58C0B3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-width="1.5"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_1 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health.

O’Neill said Thiel told him he “should really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.” “I just got more and more excited about that idea,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When asked if he’s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for “hardcore” longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O’Neill replied: “Yes.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including “Death is humanity’s core problem,” “Obviating aging is scientifically plausible,” and “I will carry the message against aging and death.” O’Neill said he agrees with all of them. “I suppose I am [a Vitalist],” he said with a smile, although he’s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. “If I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it’s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,” he said. “We are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: “You’ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people’s health.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Watch ARPA-H for news on organ replacements and more&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He promised we’ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting “high-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill said that “ARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.” The agency has a new director—Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women’s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;O’Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean Hébert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack’s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert’s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. “I would try it … Not today, but … if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We’re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;He’s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. “Someday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients’ own cells,” O’Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. “I’m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Longevity lobbyists have a friendly ear&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O’Neill said he hasn’t formally worked with them but thinks that “they’re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livingston has told me that A4LI’s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious—the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. “I would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,” he said. There’ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won’t say more for now.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It's a concept that O’Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building “freedom cities”—a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Próspera, a private city within a Honduran “special economic zone,” where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana’s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O’Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him “once or twice a year.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading—building new “startup countries” at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2009, O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that “the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.” When asked if he still thinks that’s the case, he said: “It’s not quite 2030, so I think it’s too soon to say … What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;We might expect more nutrition advice&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O’Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to “eat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,” echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O’Neill: “We’re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.” Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify “the healthiest fats,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Stay tuned.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/13/1132889/us-deputy-health-secretary-vaccine-guidelines-longevity-arpa-h-cdc-nih/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 10:37:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Newsweek CEO Dev Pragad warns publishers: adapt as AI becomes news gateway (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/newsweek-ceo-dev-pragad-warns-publishers-adapt-as-ai-becomes-news-gateway/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Picture1-2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author: Dev Pragad, CEO, Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As artificial intelligence platforms increasingly mediate how people encounter news, media leaders are confronting an important change in the relationship between journalism and the public.

That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s&lt;/em&gt; franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth. That could describe either the plot or the making of &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s Eleven&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. The main barrier to entry is usually a literal barrier to entry, like a door. Thieves’ most common move is to collude with, trick, or threaten an insider.

In 2014 US nuclear weapons researchers at Sandia National Laboratories took a detour into this demimonde, producing a 100-page report called “The Perfect Heist: Recipes from Around the World.” The scientists were worried someone might try to steal a nuke from the US arsenal, and so they compiled information on 23 high-value robberies from 1972 to 2012 into a “Heist Methods and Characteristics Database,” a critical mass of knowledge on what worked. Thieves, they found, dedicated huge amounts of money and time to planning and practice runs—sometimes more than 100. They’d use brute force, tunneling through sewers for months (Société Générale bank heist, Nice, France, 1976), or guile, donning police costumes to fool guards (Gardner Museum, Boston, 1990). But nobody was using, say, electromagnetic&amp;nbsp;pulse generators to shut down the Las Vegas electrical grid. The most successful robbers got to the valuable stuff unseen and got out fast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="rench police officers stand next to a ladder used by robbers to enter the Louvre Museum" class="wp-image-1132572" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2241678550.jpg?w=676" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Last year a heist cost the Louvre €88 million worth of antique jewelry, and the most sophisticated technology in play was an angle grinder.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;DIMITAR DILKOFF / AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Advance the time frame, and the situation looks much the same. Last year, Spanish researchers looking at art crimes from 1990 to 2022 found that the least technical methods are still the most successful. “High-tech technology doesn’t work so well,” says Erin L. Thompson, an art historian at John Jay College of Justice who studies art crime. Speed and practice trump complicated systems and alarms; even that Louvre robbery was, at heart, just a minutes-long smash-and-grab.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist.

 &lt;p&gt;An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/13/1132397/myth-of-high-tech-heist/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Agentic AI drives finance ROI in accounts payable automation (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/agentic-ai-drives-finance-roi-in-accounts-payable-automation/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Finance leaders are driving ROI using agentic AI for accounts payable automation, turning manual tasks into autonomous workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While general AI projects saw return on investment rise to 67 percent last year, autonomous agents delivered an average ROI of 80 percent by handling complex processes without human intervention. This performance gap demands a change in how CIOs allocate automation budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI systems are now advancing the enterprise from theoretical value to hard returns. Unlike generative tools that summarise data or draft text, these agents execute workflows within strict rules and approval thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boardroom pressure drives this pivot. A report by Basware and FT Longitude finds nearly half of CFOs face demands from leadership to implement AI across their operations. Yet 61 percent of finance leaders admit their organisations rolled out custom-developed AI agents largely as experiments to test capabilities rather than to solve business problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experiments often fail to pay off. Traditional AI models generate insights or predictions that require human interpretation. Agentic systems close the gap between insight and action by embedding decisions directly into the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Kurtz, CEO of Basware, explains that patience for unstructured experimentation is running low. “We’ve reached a tipping point where boards and CEOs are done with AI experiments and expecting real results,” he says. “AI for AI’s sake is a waste.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-accounts-payable-as-the-proving-ground-for-agentic-ai-in-finance"&gt;Accounts payable as the proving ground for agentic AI in finance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finance departments now direct these agents toward high-volume, rules-based environments. Accounts payable (AP) is the primary use case, with 72 percent of finance leaders viewing it as the obvious starting point. The process fits agentic deployment because it involves structured data: invoices enter, require cleaning and compliance checks, and result in a payment booking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams use agents to automate invoice capture and data entry, a daily task for 20 percent of leaders. Other live deployments include detecting duplicate invoices, identifying fraud, and reducing overpayments. These are not hypothetical applications; they represent tasks where an algorithm functions with high autonomy when parameters are correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success in this sector relies on data quality. Basware trains its systems on a dataset of more than two billion processed invoices to deliver context-aware predictions. This structured data allows the system to differentiate between legitimate anomalies and errors without human oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Kamau, Director of Product Management for Data and AI at Basware, describes AP as a “proving ground” because it combines scale, control, and accountability in a way few other finance processes can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-build-versus-buy-decision-matrix"&gt;The build versus buy decision matrix&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology leaders must next decide how to procure these capabilities. The term “agent” currently covers everything from simple workflow scripts to complex autonomous systems, which complicates procurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approaches split by function. In accounts payable, 32 percent of finance leaders prefer agentic AI embedded in existing software, compared to 20 percent who build them in-house. For financial planning and analysis (FP&amp;amp;A), 35 percent opt for self-built solutions versus 29 percent for embedded ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This divergence suggests a pragmatic rule for the C-suite. If the AI improves a process shared across many organisations, such as AP, embedding it via a vendor solution makes sense. If the AI creates a competitive advantage unique to the business, building in-house is the better path. Leaders should buy to accelerate standard processes and build to differentiate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-governance-as-an-enabler-of-speed"&gt;Governance as an enabler of speed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear of autonomous error slows adoption. Almost half of finance leaders (46%) will not consider deploying an agent without clear governance. This caution is rational; autonomous systems require strict guardrails to operate safely in regulated environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the most successful organisations do not let governance stop deployment. Instead, they use it to scale. These leaders are significantly more likely to use agents for complex tasks like compliance checks (50%) compared to their less confident peers (6%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anssi Ruokonen, Head of Data and AI at Basware, advises treating AI agents like junior colleagues. The system requires trust but should not make large decisions immediately. He suggests testing thoroughly and introducing autonomy slowly, ensuring a human remains in the loop to maintain responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital workers raise concerns regarding displacement. A third of finance leaders believe job displacement is already happening. Proponents argue agents shift the nature of work rather than eliminating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automating manual tasks such as information extraction from PDFs frees staff to focus on higher-value activities. The goal is to move from task efficiency to operating leverage, allowing finance teams to manage faster closes and make better liquidity decisions without increasing headcount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisations that use agentic AI extensively report higher returns. Leaders who deploy agentic AI tools daily for tasks like accounts payable achieve better outcomes than those who limit usage to experimentation. Confidence grows through controlled exposure; successful small-scale deployments lead to broader operational trust and increased ROI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives must move beyond unguided experimentation to replicate the success of early adopters. Data shows that 71 percent of finance teams with weak returns acted under pressure without clear direction, compared to only 13 percent of teams achieving strong ROI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success requires embedding AI directly into workflows and governing agents with the discipline applied to human employees. “Agentic AI can deliver transformational results, but only when it is deployed with purpose and discipline,” concludes Kurtz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI deployment in financial services hits an inflection point as Singapore leads the shift to production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111908" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
