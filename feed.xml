&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tools are markedly similar to one another. OpenAI suggests that users could ask ChatGPT for help finding a “new laptop suitable for gaming under $1000 with a screen that’s over 15 inches,” or they can share photos of a high-end garment and ask for something similar at a lower price point.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity, meanwhile, is playing up how its chatbot’s memory can augment shopping-related searches for its users, suggesting that someone could ask for recommendations tailored to what the chatbot already knows about them, like where they live or what they do for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season, which could be a boon for AI shopping startups like Phia, Cherry, or Deft (rebranded as Onton) — but with OpenAI and Perplexity pushing further into AI shopping experiences, are these startups in danger?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zach Hudson, CEO of the interior design shopping tool Onton, thinks that AI shopping startups with a specialized niche will still provide a better experience to users than general-purpose tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Any model or knowledge graph is only as good as its data sources,” Hudson told TechCrunch. “Right now, ChatGPT and LLM-based tools like Perplexity piggyback off existing search indexes like Bing or Google. That makes them really only as good as the first few results that come back from those indexes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Daydream CEO and longtime e-commerce executive Julie Bornstein agrees — she remarked to TechCrunch over the summer that she always viewed search as “the forgotten child” of the fashion industry, since it never worked particularly well.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Fashion&amp;nbsp;… is uniquely nuanced and emotional — finding a dress you love is not the same as finding a television,” Bornstein told TechCrunch on Tuesday. “That level of understanding for fashion shopping comes from domain-specific data and merchandising logic that grasps silhouettes, fabrics, occasions, and how people build outfits over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI shopping startups develop their own datasets so that their tools are trained on higher-quality data — something that’s easier to achieve when you’re attempting to catalog fashion or furniture, rather than the sum of all human knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In Hudson’s case, Onton developed a data pipeline to catalog hundreds of thousands of interior design products in a cleaner manner, helping to train its internal models with better data. But if AI shopping startups don’t pursue that level of specialization, Hudson thinks they’re bound to be overshadowed.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you’re using only off-the-shelf LLMs and a conversational interface, it’s very hard to see how a startup can compete with the larger companies,” Hudson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The advantage for OpenAI and Perplexity, however, is that their customers are already using their tools — plus, their large presence lets them ink deals with major retailers from the get-go. While Daydream and Phia redirect customers to retailers’ websites to complete their purchases — sometimes earning affiliate revenue — OpenAI and Perplexity have partnerships with Shopify and PayPal, respectively, allowing users to check out within the conversational interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These companies, which depend on mammoth amounts of expensive compute power to operate, are still trying to figure out a path to profitability. If they take inspiration from Google and Amazon, then it makes sense to look toward e-commerce as an option — retailers could pay them to advertise their products within search results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But eventually, that could just exacerbate the existing issues that customers have with search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Vertical models — whether in fashion, travel, or home goods — will outperform because they’re tuned to real consumer decision-making,” Bornstein said.&lt;/p&gt;

WMG said in a press release that the deal with Suno will “open new frontiers in music creation, interaction, and discovery, while both compensating and protecting artists, songwriters, and the wider creative community.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;WMG also announced that it has sold Songkick, a live music and concert-discovery platform, to Suno for an undisclosed amount. WMG had acquired Songkick’s app and brand in 2017, while Live Nation later acquired Songkick’s ticketing business.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;WMG says Songkick will continue as a fan destination under Suno.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As a result of WMG’s partnership, Suno will launch more advanced and licensed models that will replace its current ones next year. Downloading audio from the service will require a paid account, while users on the free tier will be limited to playing and sharing songs made on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;WMG’s artists and songwriters will also have full control over whether and how their names, images, likenesses, voices,&amp;nbsp;and compositions are used in new AI-generated music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Artists signed to WMG include Lady Gaga, Coldplay, The Weeknd, Sabrina Carpenter, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This landmark pact with Suno is a victory for the creative community that benefits everyone,” said WMG CEO Robert Kyncl in the press release. “With Suno rapidly scaling, both in users and monetization, we’ve seized this opportunity to shape models that expand revenue and deliver new fan experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The news comes a week after WMG settled its copyright lawsuit with AI music startup&amp;nbsp;Udio and entered into a licensing deal for an AI music creation service that’s set to launch in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;WMG’s settlements with Suno and Udio mark a significant shift in the music industry’s approach to AI. Last year, Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment sued Suno and Udio for copyright infringement.&amp;nbsp;While WMG has settled its lawsuits with Suno and Udio, Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment are&amp;nbsp;also reportedly in talks to license their work&amp;nbsp;to Udio and Suno and settle their lawsuits against the startups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a sign of investor confidence in AI music technology, Suno&amp;nbsp;announced&amp;nbsp;last week that it raised a&amp;nbsp;$250 million Series C round&amp;nbsp;at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/piratedea-hMJ-r8y9zzA-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Warner Music Group (WMG)&amp;nbsp;announced on Tuesday that it has reached a deal with Suno, settling its copyright lawsuit against the AI music startup.

OpenAI announced on Tuesday it is updating the user interface to its popular AI chatbot so users can access ChatGPT Voice right inside their chat, instead of having to switch to a separate mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That means you’ll be able to converse with the chatbot and view its responses, including things like shared images, as you talk. Before, you’d be taken to a separate screen where you’d interact with an animated blue circle that represented the interface for ChatGPT’s voice. That screen also had a mute button and an option to record live video, as well as an X to return to the default text-based mode. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During these prior conversations, you could only listen to what ChatGPT was saying, instead of seeing it on the screen. That could be annoying if you missed a response, as you’d have to leave the separate voice mode to see the response as text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT Voice right inside chat—no separate mode needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can talk, watch answers appear, review earlier messages, and see visuals like images or maps in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolling out to all users on mobile and web.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, the company says you can talk and watch your answers appear as ChatGPT responds to your questions. You can also review your earlier messages and view visuals during your conversations, like images or maps, in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The change will make it more natural to interact with the AI chatbot, as you can more easily move between speech and text in the same conversation; however, you’ll still need to tap “end” to stop the voice conversation when you’re ready to switch back to text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This revamped voice mode is the new default and is rolling out now to all users across web and mobile apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For those who prefer the separate voice mode, OpenAI says they can still revert to the original experience under “Voice Mode” in “Settings.” Here, they’ll see a new option to turn on “Separate mode.” &lt;/p&gt;

The feature comes as an alternative to the company’s chatbots, which are no longer accessible to users under 18 as of this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The change follows growing concerns about the mental health risks of AI chatbots that are available 24/7 and can initiate conversations with users. Several lawsuits have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI over their alleged role in users’ suicides. Over the past month, Character.AI has been slowly phasing out access for minors, and as of Tuesday, underage users can no longer chat with its AI characters at all.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Stories offer a guided way to create and explore fiction, in lieu of open-ended chat,” the company said in the blog post. “It will be offered along with our other multimodal features, so teens can continue engaging with their favorite Characters in a safety-first setting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Interactive fiction has seen a surge in popularity over the last few years, so Character.AI’s pivot makes sense. But it may not be enough to satiate users who have become overly dependent on the chatbots — which is all the more reason why Character.AI’s decision to limit chatbot access was warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the Character.AI subreddit, reactions are mixed. According to their comments, some teens say that while they’re disappointed, they think it’s ultimately the right move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m so mad about the ban but also so happy because now I can do other things and my addiction might be over finally,” one user who identified themselves as a teenager wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another said, “as someone who is under 18 this is just disappointing. but also rightfully so bc people over here my age get addicted to this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It remains to be seen how teens will use the Stories feature, but the format is less psychologically dubious than roleplaying with chatbots. Unlike Stories, chatbots directly interact with users in open-ended conversations and can send unprompted messages even when users aren’t actively using the app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Character.AI’s decision to age-gate chatbot access comes at a time when California recently became the first state to regulate AI companions. Meanwhile, Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have introduced a national bill that would ban AI companions for minors altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I really hope us leading the way sets a standard in the industry that for under 18s, open-ended chats are probably not the path or the product to offer,” Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand told TechCrunch last month.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1200,819" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Character.AI announced on Tuesday that it’s launching “Stories,” a new format that allows users to create interactive fiction that features their favorite characters. The feature comes as an alternative to the company’s chatbots, which are no longer accessible to users under 18 as of this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The change follows growing concerns about the mental health risks of AI chatbots that are available 24/7 and can initiate conversations with users. Several lawsuits have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI over their alleged role in users’ suicides. Over the past month, Character.AI has been slowly phasing out access for minors, and as of Tuesday, underage users can no longer chat with its AI characters at all.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Stories offer a guided way to create and explore fiction, in lieu of open-ended chat,” the company said in the blog post. “It will be offered along with our other multimodal features, so teens can continue engaging with their favorite Characters in a safety-first setting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Interactive fiction has seen a surge in popularity over the last few years, so Character.AI’s pivot makes sense.

            &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;More than 300 people across academia and industry spilled into an auditorium to attend a&amp;nbsp;BoltzGen seminar on Thursday, Oct. 30, hosted by the&amp;nbsp;Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health (MIT Jameel Clinic). Headlining the event was MIT PhD student and BoltzGen’s first author Hannes Stärk, who had announced BoltzGen just a few days prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Building upon&amp;nbsp;Boltz-2, an open-source biomolecular structure prediction model predicting protein binding affinity that made waves over the summer,&amp;nbsp;BoltzGen (officially released on Sunday, Oct. 26.) is the first model of its kind to go a step further by generating novel protein binders that are ready to enter the drug discovery pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Three key innovations make this possible: first, BoltzGen’s ability to carry out a variety of tasks, unifying protein design and structure prediction while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Next, BoltzGen’s built-in constraints are designed with feedback from wetlab collaborators to ensure the model creates functional proteins that don’t defy the laws of physics or chemistry. Lastly, a rigorous evaluation process tests the model on “undruggable” disease targets, pushing the limits of BoltzGen’s binder generation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most models used in industry or academia are capable of either structure prediction or protein design. Moreover, they’re limited to generating certain types of proteins that bind successfully to easy “targets.” Much like students responding to a test question that looks like their homework, as long as the training data looks similar to the target during binder design, the models often work. But existing methods are nearly always evaluated on targets for which structures with binders already exist, and end up faltering in performance when used on more challenging targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There have been models trying to tackle binder design, but the problem is that these models are modality-specific,” Stärk points out. “A general model does not only mean that we can address more tasks. Additionally, we obtain a better model for the individual task since emulating physics is learned by example, and with a more general training scheme, we provide more such examples containing generalizable physical patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The BoltzGen researchers went out of their way to test BoltzGen on 26 targets, ranging from therapeutically relevant cases to ones explicitly chosen for their dissimilarity to the training data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This comprehensive validation process, which took place in eight wetlabs across academia and industry, demonstrates the model’s breadth and potential for breakthrough drug development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Parabilis Medicines, one of the industry collaborators that tested BoltzGen in a wetlab setting, praised BoltzGen’s potential:&amp;nbsp;“we feel that adopting BoltzGen into our existing Helicon peptide computational platform capabilities promises to accelerate our progress to deliver transformational drugs against major human diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While the open-source releases of Boltz-1, Boltz-2, and now BoltzGen (which was previewed at the&amp;nbsp;7th Molecular Machine Learning Conference on Oct. 22) bring new opportunities and transparency in drug development, they also signal that biotech and pharmaceutical industries may need to reevaluate their offerings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Amid the buzz for BoltzGen on the social media platform X, Justin Grace, a principal machine learning scientist at LabGenius, raised a question. “The private-to-open performance time lag for chat AI systems is [seven] months and falling,” Grace wrote in&amp;nbsp;a post. “It looks to be even shorter in the protein space. How will binder-as-a-service co’s be able to [recoup] investment when we can just wait a few months for the free version?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For those in academia, BoltzGen represents an expansion and acceleration of scientific possibility.&amp;nbsp;“A question that my students often ask me is, ‘where can AI change the therapeutics game?’” says senior co-author and MIT Professor Regina Barzilay, AI faculty lead for the Jameel Clinic and an affiliate of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). “Unless we identify undruggable targets and propose a solution, we won’t be changing the game,” she adds. “The emphasis here is on unsolved problems, which distinguishes Hannes’ work from others in the field.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Senior co-author Tommi Jaakkola, the Thomas Siebel Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science who is affiliated with the Jameel Clinic and CSAIL, notes that "models such as BoltzGen that are released fully open-source enable broader community-wide efforts to accelerate drug design capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Stärk believes that the future of biomolecular design will be upended by AI models.&amp;nbsp;“I want to build tools that help us manipulate biology to solve disease, or perform tasks with molecular machines that we have not even imagined yet,” he says. “I want to provide these tools and enable biologists to imagine things that they have not even thought of before.”&lt;/p&gt;

An upcoming open-source model is Flux.2 [Klein], which will also be released under Apache 2.0 when available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the open source Flux.2 VAE, or variational autoencoder, is important and useful to enterprises for several reasons. This is a module that compresses images into a latent space and reconstructs them back into high-resolution outputs; in Flux.2, it defines the latent representation used across the multiple (four total, see blow) model variants, enabling higher-quality reconstructions, more efficient training, and 4-megapixel editing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this VAE is open and freely usable, enterprises can adopt the same latent space used by BFL’s commercial models in their own self-hosted pipelines, gaining interoperability between internal systems and external providers while avoiding vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The availability of a fully open, standardized latent space also enables practical benefits beyond media-focused organizations. Enterprises can use an open-source VAE as a stable, shared foundation for multiple image-generation models, allowing them to switch or mix generators without reworking downstream tools or workflows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standardizing on a transparent, Apache-licensed VAE supports auditability and compliance requirements, ensures consistent reconstruction quality across internal assets, and allows future models trained for the same latent space to function as drop-in replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transparency also enables downstream customization such as lightweight fine-tuning for brand styles or internal visual templates—even for organizations that do not specialize in media but rely on consistent, controllable image generation for marketing materials, product imagery, documentation, or stock-style visuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement positions FLUX.2 as an evolution of the FLUX.1 family, with an emphasis on reliability, controllability, and integration into existing creative pipelines rather than one-off demos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Shift Toward Production-Centric Image Models&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 extends the prior FLUX.1 architecture with more consistent character, layout, and style adherence across up to ten reference images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system maintains coherence at 4-megapixel resolutions for both generation and editing tasks, enabling use cases such as product visualization, brand-aligned asset creation, and structured design workflows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model also improves prompt following across multi-part instructions while reducing failure modes related to lighting, spatial logic, and world knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Black Forest Labs continues to follow an open-core release strategy. The company provides hosted, performance-optimized versions of FLUX.2 for commercial deployments, while also publishing inspectable open-weight models that researchers and independent developers can run locally. This approach extends a track record begun with FLUX.1, which became the most widely used open image model globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Model Variants and Deployment Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flux.2 arrives with 5 variants as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Pro]:&lt;/b&gt; This is the highest-performance tier, intended for applications that require minimal latency and maximal visual fidelity. It is available through the BFL Playground, the FLUX API, and partner platforms. The model aims to match leading closed-weight systems in prompt adherence and image quality while reducing compute demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Flex]:&lt;/b&gt; This version exposes parameters such as the number of sampling steps and the guidance scale. The design enables developers to tune the trade-offs between speed, text accuracy, and detail fidelity. In practice, this enables workflows where low-step previews can be generated quickly before higher-step renders are invoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Dev]:&lt;/b&gt; The most notable release for the open ecosystem is the 32-billion-parameter open-weight checkpoint which integrates text-to-image generation and image editing into a single model. It supports multi-reference conditioning without requiring separate modules or pipelines. The model can run locally using BFL’s reference inference code or optimized fp8 implementations developed in partnership with NVIDIA and ComfyUI. Hosted inference is also available via FAL, Replicate, Runware, Verda, TogetherAI, Cloudflare, and DeepInfra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Klein]:&lt;/b&gt; Coming soon, this size-distilled model is released under Apache 2.0 and is intended to offer improved performance relative to comparable models of the same size trained from scratch. A beta program is currently open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 – VAE:&lt;/b&gt; Released under the enterprise friendly (even for commercial use) Apache 2.0 license,  updated variational autoencoder provides the latent space that underpins all Flux.2 variants. The VAE emphasizes an optimized balance between reconstruction fidelity, learnability, and compression rate—a long-standing challenge for latent-space generative architectures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benchmark Performance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Forest Labs published two sets of evaluations highlighting FLUX.2’s performance relative to other open-weight and hosted image-generation models. In head-to-head win-rate comparisons across three categories—text-to-image generation, single-reference editing, and multi-reference editing—FLUX.2 [Dev] led all open-weight alternatives by a substantial margin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It achieved a 66.6% win rate in text-to-image generation (vs. 51.3% for Qwen-Image and 48.1% for Hunyuan Image 3.0), 59.8% in single-reference editing (vs. 49.3% for Qwen-Image and 41.2% for FLUX.1 Kontext), and 63.6% in multi-reference editing (vs. 36.4% for Qwen-Image). These results reflect consistent gains over both earlier FLUX.1 models and contemporary open-weight systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second benchmark compared model quality using ELO scores against approximate per-image cost. In this analysis, FLUX.2 [Pro], FLUX.2 [Flex], and FLUX.2 [Dev] cluster in the upper-quality, lower-cost region of the chart, with ELO scores in the ~1030–1050 band while operating in the 2–6 cent range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, earlier models such as FLUX.1 Kontext [max] and Hunyuan Image 3.0 appear significantly lower on the ELO axis despite similar or higher per-image costs. Only proprietary competitors like Nano Banana 2 reach higher ELO levels, but at noticeably elevated cost. According to BFL, this positions FLUX.2’s variants as offering strong quality–cost efficiency across performance tiers, with FLUX.2 [Dev] in particular delivering near–top-tier quality while remaining one of the lowest-cost options in its class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pricing via API and Comparison to Nano Banana Pro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://bfl.ai/pricing"&gt;pricing calculator on BFL’s site&lt;/a&gt; indicates that FLUX.2 [Pro] is billed at roughly $0.03 per megapixel of combined input and output. A standard 1024×1024 (1 MP) generation costs $0.030, and higher resolutions scale proportionally. The calculator also counts input images toward total megapixels, suggesting that multi-image reference workflows will have higher per-call costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Google’s Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview aka &amp;quot;Nano Banana Pro,&amp;quot; currently &lt;a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing"&gt;prices image output &lt;/a&gt;at $120 per 1M tokens, resulting in a cost of $0.134 per 1K–2K image (up to 2048×2048) and $0.24 per 4K image. Image input is billed at $0.0011 per image, which is negligible compared to output costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Gemini’s model uses token-based billing, its effective per-image pricing places 1K–2K images at more than 4× the cost of a 1 MP FLUX.2 [Pro] generation, and 4K outputs at roughly 8× the cost of a similar-resolution FLUX.2 output if scaled proportionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, the available data suggests that FLUX.2 [Pro] currently offers significantly lower per-image pricing, particularly for high-resolution outputs or multi-image editing workflows, whereas Gemini 3 Pro’s preview tier is positioned as a higher-cost, token-metered service with more variability depending on resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Technical Design and the Latent Space Overhaul&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 is built on a latent flow matching architecture, combining a rectified flow transformer with a vision-language model based on Mistral-3 (24B). The VLM contributes semantic grounding and contextual understanding, while the transformer handles spatial structure, material representation, and lighting behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major component of the update is the re-training of the model’s latent space. The FLUX.2 VAE integrates advances in semantic alignment, reconstruction quality, and representational learnability drawn from recent research on autoencoder optimization. Earlier models often faced trade-offs in the learnability–quality–compression triad: highly compressed spaces increase training efficiency but degrade reconstructions, while wider bottlenecks can reduce the ability of generative models to learn consistent transformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to BFL’s research data, the FLUX.2 VAE achieves lower LPIPS distortion than the FLUX.1 and SD autoencoders while also improving generative FID. This balance allows FLUX.2 to support high-fidelity editing—an area that typically demands reconstruction accuracy—and still maintain competitive learnability for large-scale generative training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Capabilities Across Creative Workflows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant functional upgrade is multi-reference support. FLUX.2 can ingest up to ten reference images and maintain identity, product details, or stylistic elements across the output. This feature is relevant for commercial applications such as merchandising, virtual photography, storyboarding, and branded campaign development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system’s typography improvements address a persistent challenge for diffusion- and flow-based architectures. FLUX.2 is able to generate legible fine text, structured layouts, UI elements, and infographic-style assets with greater reliability. This capability, combined with flexible aspect ratios and high-resolution editing, broadens the use cases where text and image jointly define the final output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 enhances instruction following for multi-step, compositional prompts, enabling more predictable outcomes in constrained workflows. The model exhibits better grounding in physical attributes—such as lighting and material behavior—reducing inconsistencies in scenes requiring photoreal equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecosystem and Open-Core Strategy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Forest Labs continues to position its models within an ecosystem that blends open research with commercial reliability. The FLUX.1 open models helped establish the company’s reach across both the developer and enterprise markets, and FLUX.2 expands this structure: tightly optimized commercial endpoints for production deployments and open, composable checkpoints for research and community experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company emphasizes transparency through published inference code, open-weight VAE release, prompting guides, and detailed architectural documentation. It also continues to recruit talent in Freiburg and San Francisco as it pursues a longer-term roadmap toward multimodal models that unify perception, memory, reasoning, and generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background: Flux and the Formation of Black Forest Labs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Forest Labs (BFL) was &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/stable-diffusion-creators-launch-black-forest-labs-secure-31m-for-flux-1-ai-image-generator"&gt;founded in 2024 &lt;/a&gt;by Robin Rombach, Patrick Esser, and Andreas Blattmann, the original creators of Stable Diffusion. Their move from Stability AI came at a moment of turbulence for the broader open-source generative AI community, and the launch of BFL signaled a renewed effort to build accessible, high-performance image models. The company secured $31 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with additional support from Brendan Iribe, Michael Ovitz, and Garry Tan, providing early validation for its technical direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BFL’s first major release, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/stable-diffusion-creators-launch-black-forest-labs-secure-31m-for-flux-1-ai-image-generator"&gt;FLUX.1&lt;/a&gt;, introduced a 12-billion-parameter architecture available in Pro, Dev, and Schnell variants. It quickly gained a reputation for output quality that matched or exceeded closed-source competitors such as Midjourney v6 and DALL·E 3, while the Dev and Schnell versions reinforced the company’s commitment to open distribution. FLUX.1 also saw rapid adoption in downstream products, including xAI’s Grok 2, and arrived amid ongoing industry discussions about dataset transparency, responsible model usage, and the role of open-source distribution. BFL published strict usage policies aimed at preventing misuse and non-consensual content generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/black-forest-labs-releases-flux-1-1-pro-and-an-api"&gt;BFL expanded the lineup with Flux 1.1 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a proprietary high-speed model delivering sixfold generation speed improvements and achieving leading ELO scores on Artificial Analysis. The company launched a paid API alongside the release, enabling configurable integrations with adjustable resolution, model choice, and moderation settings at pricing that began at $0.04 per image. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnerships with TogetherAI, Replicate, FAL, and Freepik broadened access and made the model available to users without the need for self-hosting, extending BFL’s reach across commercial and creator-oriented platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These developments unfolded against a backdrop of accelerating competition in generative media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implications for Enterprise Technical Decision Makers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FLUX.2 release carries distinct operational implications for enterprise teams responsible for AI engineering, orchestration, data management, and security. For AI engineers responsible for model lifecycle management, the availability of both hosted endpoints and open-weight checkpoints enables flexible integration paths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2’s multi-reference capabilities and expanded resolution support reduce the need for bespoke fine-tuning pipelines when handling brand-specific or identity-consistent outputs, lowering development overhead and accelerating deployment timelines. The model’s improved prompt adherence and typography performance also reduce iterative prompting cycles, which can have a measurable impact on production workload efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams focused on AI orchestration and operational scaling benefit from the structure of FLUX.2’s product family. The Pro tier offers predictable latency characteristics suitable for pipeline-critical workloads, while the Flex tier enables direct control over sampling steps and guidance parameters, aligning with environments that require strict performance tuning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open-weight access for the Dev model facilitates the creation of custom containerized deployments and allows orchestration platforms to manage the model under existing CI/CD practices. This is particularly relevant for organizations balancing cutting-edge tooling with budget constraints, as self-hosted deployments offer cost control at the expense of in-house optimization requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data engineering stakeholders gain advantages from the model’s latent architecture and improved reconstruction fidelity. High-quality, predictable image representations reduce downstream data-cleaning burdens in workflows where generated assets feed into analytics systems, creative automation pipelines, or multimodal model development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because FLUX.2 consolidates text-to-image and image-editing functions into a single model, it simplifies integration points and reduces the complexity of data flows across storage, versioning, and monitoring layers. For teams managing large volumes of reference imagery, the ability to incorporate up to ten inputs per generation may also streamline asset management processes by shifting more variation handling into the model rather than external tooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For security teams, FLUX.2’s open-core approach introduces considerations related to access control, model governance, and API usage monitoring. Hosted FLUX.2 endpoints allow for centralized enforcement of security policies and reduce local exposure to model weights, which may be preferable for organizations with stricter compliance requirements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, open-weight deployments require internal controls for model integrity, version tracking, and inference-time monitoring to prevent misuse or unapproved modifications. The model’s handling of typography and realistic compositions also reinforces the need for established content governance frameworks, particularly where generative systems interface with public-facing channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across these roles, FLUX.2’s design emphasizes predictable performance characteristics, modular deployment options, and reduced operational friction. For enterprises with lean teams or rapidly evolving requirements, the release offers a set of capabilities aligned with practical constraints around speed, quality, budget, and model governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 marks a substantial iterative improvement in Black Forest Labs’ generative image stack, with notable gains in multi-reference consistency, text rendering, latent space quality, and structured prompt adherence. By pairing fully managed offerings with open-weight checkpoints, BFL maintains its open-core model while extending its relevance to commercial creative workflows. The release demonstrates a shift from experimental image generation toward more predictable, scalable, and controllable systems suited for operational use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not just &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-unveils-gemini-3-claiming-the-lead-in-math-science-multimodal-and"&gt;Google&amp;#x27;s Gemini 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-upgraded-nano-banana-pro-ai-image-model-hailed-as-absolutely-bonkers"&gt;Nano Banana Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropics-claude-opus-4-5-is-here-cheaper-ai-infinite-chats-and-coding"&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/a&gt; we have to be thankful for this year around the Thanksgiving holiday here in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, today the German AI startup &lt;a href="https://bfl.ai/blog/flux-2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Black Forest Labs released FLUX.2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new image generation and editing system complete with four different models designed to support production-grade creative workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 introduces multi-reference conditioning, higher-fidelity outputs, and improved text rendering, and it expands the company’s open-core ecosystem with both commercial endpoints and open-weight checkpoints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Black Forest Labs previously launched with and made a name for itself on open source text-to-image models in its Flux family, today&amp;#x27;s release includes one fully open-source component: the Flux.2 VAE, available now under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four other models of varying size and uses — Flux.2 [Pro], Flux.2 [Flex], and Flux.2 [Dev] —are not open source; Pro and Flex remain proprietary hosted offerings, while Dev is an open-weight downloadable model that requires a commercial license obtained directly from Black Forest Labs for any commercial use. An upcoming open-source model is Flux.2 [Klein], which will also be released under Apache 2.0 when available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the open source Flux.2 VAE, or variational autoencoder, is important and useful to enterprises for several reasons. This is a module that compresses images into a latent space and reconstructs them back into high-resolution outputs; in Flux.2, it defines the latent representation used across the multiple (four total, see blow) model variants, enabling higher-quality reconstructions, more efficient training, and 4-megapixel editing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this VAE is open and freely usable, enterprises can adopt the same latent space used by BFL’s commercial models in their own self-hosted pipelines, gaining interoperability between internal systems and external providers while avoiding vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The availability of a fully open, standardized latent space also enables practical benefits beyond media-focused organizations. Enterprises can use an open-source VAE as a stable, shared foundation for multiple image-generation models, allowing them to switch or mix generators without reworking downstream tools or workflows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standardizing on a transparent, Apache-licensed VAE supports auditability and compliance requirements, ensures consistent reconstruction quality across internal assets, and allows future models trained for the same latent space to function as drop-in replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transparency also enables downstream customization such as lightweight fine-tuning for brand styles or internal visual templates—even for organizations that do not specialize in media but rely on consistent, controllable image generation for marketing materials, product imagery, documentation, or stock-style visuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement positions FLUX.2 as an evolution of the FLUX.1 family, with an emphasis on reliability, controllability, and integration into existing creative pipelines rather than one-off demos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Shift Toward Production-Centric Image Models&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 extends the prior FLUX.1 architecture with more consistent character, layout, and style adherence across up to ten reference images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system maintains coherence at 4-megapixel resolutions for both generation and editing tasks, enabling use cases such as product visualization, brand-aligned asset creation, and structured design workflows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model also improves prompt following across multi-part instructions while reducing failure modes related to lighting, spatial logic, and world knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Black Forest Labs continues to follow an open-core release strategy. The company provides hosted, performance-optimized versions of FLUX.2 for commercial deployments, while also publishing inspectable open-weight models that researchers and independent developers can run locally. This approach extends a track record begun with FLUX.1, which became the most widely used open image model globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Model Variants and Deployment Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flux.2 arrives with 5 variants as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Pro]:&lt;/b&gt; This is the highest-performance tier, intended for applications that require minimal latency and maximal visual fidelity. It is available through the BFL Playground, the FLUX API, and partner platforms. The model aims to match leading closed-weight systems in prompt adherence and image quality while reducing compute demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Flex]:&lt;/b&gt; This version exposes parameters such as the number of sampling steps and the guidance scale. The design enables developers to tune the trade-offs between speed, text accuracy, and detail fidelity. In practice, this enables workflows where low-step previews can be generated quickly before higher-step renders are invoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Dev]:&lt;/b&gt; The most notable release for the open ecosystem is the 32-billion-parameter open-weight checkpoint which integrates text-to-image generation and image editing into a single model. It supports multi-reference conditioning without requiring separate modules or pipelines. The model can run locally using BFL’s reference inference code or optimized fp8 implementations developed in partnership with NVIDIA and ComfyUI. Hosted inference is also available via FAL, Replicate, Runware, Verda, TogetherAI, Cloudflare, and DeepInfra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Klein]:&lt;/b&gt; Coming soon, this size-distilled model is released under Apache 2.0 and is intended to offer improved performance relative to comparable models of the same size trained from scratch. A beta program is currently open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 – VAE:&lt;/b&gt; Released under the enterprise friendly (even for commercial use) Apache 2.0 license,  updated variational autoencoder provides the latent space that underpins all Flux.2 variants. The VAE emphasizes an optimized balance between reconstruction fidelity, learnability, and compression rate—a long-standing challenge for latent-space generative architectures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benchmark Performance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Forest Labs published two sets of evaluations highlighting FLUX.2’s performance relative to other open-weight and hosted image-generation models. In head-to-head win-rate comparisons across three categories—text-to-image generation, single-reference editing, and multi-reference editing—FLUX.2 [Dev] led all open-weight alternatives by a substantial margin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It achieved a 66.6% win rate in text-to-image generation (vs. 51.3% for Qwen-Image and 48.1% for Hunyuan Image 3.0), 59.8% in single-reference editing (vs. 49.3% for Qwen-Image and 41.2% for FLUX.1 Kontext), and 63.6% in multi-reference editing (vs. 36.4% for Qwen-Image). These results reflect consistent gains over both earlier FLUX.1 models and contemporary open-weight systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second benchmark compared model quality using ELO scores against approximate per-image cost. In this analysis, FLUX.2 [Pro], FLUX.2 [Flex], and FLUX.2 [Dev] cluster in the upper-quality, lower-cost region of the chart, with ELO scores in the ~1030–1050 band while operating in the 2–6 cent range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, earlier models such as FLUX.1 Kontext [max] and Hunyuan Image 3.0 appear significantly lower on the ELO axis despite similar or higher per-image costs. Only proprietary competitors like Nano Banana 2 reach higher ELO levels, but at noticeably elevated cost. According to BFL, this positions FLUX.2’s variants as offering strong quality–cost efficiency across performance tiers, with FLUX.2 [Dev] in particular delivering near–top-tier quality while remaining one of the lowest-cost options in its class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pricing via API and Comparison to Nano Banana Pro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://bfl.ai/pricing"&gt;pricing calculator on BFL’s site&lt;/a&gt; indicates that FLUX.2 [Pro] is billed at roughly $0.03 per megapixel of combined input and output. A standard 1024×1024 (1 MP) generation costs $0.030, and higher resolutions scale proportionally. The calculator also counts input images toward total megapixels, suggesting that multi-image reference workflows will have higher per-call costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Google’s Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview aka &amp;quot;Nano Banana Pro,&amp;quot; currently &lt;a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing"&gt;prices image output &lt;/a&gt;at $120 per 1M tokens, resulting in a cost of $0.134 per 1K–2K image (up to 2048×2048) and $0.24 per 4K image. Image input is billed at $0.0011 per image, which is negligible compared to output costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Gemini’s model uses token-based billing, its effective per-image pricing places 1K–2K images at more than 4× the cost of a 1 MP FLUX.2 [Pro] generation, and 4K outputs at roughly 8× the cost of a similar-resolution FLUX.2 output if scaled proportionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, the available data suggests that FLUX.2 [Pro] currently offers significantly lower per-image pricing, particularly for high-resolution outputs or multi-image editing workflows, whereas Gemini 3 Pro’s preview tier is positioned as a higher-cost, token-metered service with more variability depending on resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Technical Design and the Latent Space Overhaul&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 is built on a latent flow matching architecture, combining a rectified flow transformer with a vision-language model based on Mistral-3 (24B). The VLM contributes semantic grounding and contextual understanding, while the transformer handles spatial structure, material representation, and lighting behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major component of the update is the re-training of the model’s latent space. The FLUX.2 VAE integrates advances in semantic alignment, reconstruction quality, and representational learnability drawn from recent research on autoencoder optimization. Earlier models often faced trade-offs in the learnability–quality–compression triad: highly compressed spaces increase training efficiency but degrade reconstructions, while wider bottlenecks can reduce the ability of generative models to learn consistent transformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to BFL’s research data, the FLUX.2 VAE achieves lower LPIPS distortion than the FLUX.1 and SD autoencoders while also improving generative FID. This balance allows FLUX.2 to support high-fidelity editing—an area that typically demands reconstruction accuracy—and still maintain competitive learnability for large-scale generative training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Capabilities Across Creative Workflows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant functional upgrade is multi-reference support. FLUX.2 can ingest up to ten reference images and maintain identity, product details, or stylistic elements across the output. This feature is relevant for commercial applications such as merchandising, virtual photography, storyboarding, and branded campaign development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system’s typography improvements address a persistent challenge for diffusion- and flow-based architectures.

This capability, combined with flexible aspect ratios and high-resolution editing, broadens the use cases where text and image jointly define the final output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 enhances instruction following for multi-step, compositional prompts, enabling more predictable outcomes in constrained workflows. The model exhibits better grounding in physical attributes—such as lighting and material behavior—reducing inconsistencies in scenes requiring photoreal equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecosystem and Open-Core Strategy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Forest Labs continues to position its models within an ecosystem that blends open research with commercial reliability. The FLUX.1 open models helped establish the company’s reach across both the developer and enterprise markets, and FLUX.2 expands this structure: tightly optimized commercial endpoints for production deployments and open, composable checkpoints for research and community experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company emphasizes transparency through published inference code, open-weight VAE release, prompting guides, and detailed architectural documentation.

            &lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) sometimes learn the wrong lessons, according to an MIT study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than answering a query based on domain knowledge, an LLM could respond by leveraging grammatical patterns it learned during training. This can cause a model to fail unexpectedly when deployed on new tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that models can mistakenly link certain sentence patterns to specific topics, so an LLM might give a convincing answer by recognizing familiar phrasing instead of understanding the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their experiments showed that even the most powerful LLMs can make this mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shortcoming could reduce the reliability of LLMs that perform tasks like handling customer inquiries, summarizing clinical notes, and generating financial reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also have safety risks. A nefarious actor could exploit this to trick LLMs into producing harmful content, even when the models have safeguards to prevent such responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After identifying this phenomenon and exploring its implications, the researchers developed a benchmarking procedure to evaluate a model’s reliance on these incorrect correlations. The procedure could help developers mitigate the problem before deploying LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a byproduct of how we train models, but models are now used in practice in safety-critical domains far beyond the tasks that created these syntactic failure modes. If you’re not familiar with model training as an end-user, this is likely to be unexpected,” says Marzyeh Ghassemi, an associate professor in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), a member of the MIT Institute of Medical Engineering Sciences and the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghassemi is joined by co-lead authors Chantal Shaib, a graduate student at Northeastern University and visiting student at MIT; and Vinith Suriyakumar, an MIT graduate student; as well as Levent Sagun, a research scientist at Meta; and Byron Wallace, the Sy and Laurie Sternberg Interdisciplinary Associate Professor and associate dean of research at Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences. A paper describing the work will be presented at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stuck on syntax&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs are trained on a massive amount of text from the internet. During this training process, the model learns to understand the relationships between words and phrases — knowledge it uses later when responding to queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In prior work, the researchers found that LLMs pick up patterns in the parts of speech that frequently appear together in training data. They call these part-of-speech patterns “syntactic templates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs need this understanding of syntax, along with semantic knowledge, to answer questions in a particular domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the news domain, for instance, there is a particular style of writing. So, not only is the model learning the semantics, it is also learning the underlying structure of how sentences should be put together to follow a specific style for that domain,” Shaib explains.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in this research, they determined that LLMs learn to associate these syntactic templates with specific domains. The model may incorrectly rely solely on this learned association when answering questions, rather than on an understanding of the query and subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, an LLM might learn that a question like “Where is Paris located?” is structured as adverb/verb/proper noun/verb. If there are many examples of sentence construction in the model’s training data, the LLM may associate that syntactic template with questions about countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if the model is given a new question with the same grammatical structure but nonsense words, like “Quickly sit Paris clouded?” it might answer “France” even though that answer makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an overlooked type of association that the model learns in order to answer questions correctly. We should be paying closer attention to not only the semantics but the syntax of the data we use to train our models,” Shaib says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing the meaning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested this phenomenon by designing synthetic experiments in which only one syntactic template appeared in the model’s training data for each domain. They tested the models by substituting words with synonyms, antonyms, or random words, but kept the underlying syntax the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each instance, they found that LLMs often still responded with the correct answer, even when the question was complete nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they restructured the same question using a new part-of-speech pattern, the LLMs often failed to give the correct response, even though the underlying meaning of the question remained the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used this approach to test pre-trained LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama, and found that this same learned behavior significantly lowered their performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious about the broader implications of these findings, the researchers studied whether someone could exploit this phenomenon to elicit harmful responses from an LLM that has been deliberately trained to refuse such requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that, by phrasing the question using a syntactic template the model associates with a “safe” dataset (one that doesn’t contain harmful information), they could trick the model into overriding its refusal policy and generating harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From this work, it is clear to me that we need more robust defenses to address security vulnerabilities in LLMs. In this paper, we identified a new vulnerability that arises due to the way LLMs learn. So, we need to figure out new defenses based on how LLMs learn language, rather than just ad hoc solutions to different vulnerabilities,” Suriyakumar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers didn’t explore mitigation strategies in this work, they developed an automatic benchmarking technique one could use to evaluate an LLM’s reliance on this incorrect syntax-domain correlation. This new test could help developers proactively address this shortcoming in their models, reducing safety risks and improving performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to study potential mitigation strategies, which could involve augmenting training data to provide a wider variety of syntactic templates. They are also interested in exploring this phenomenon in reasoning models, special types of LLMs designed to tackle multi-step tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this is a really creative angle to study failure modes of LLMs. This work highlights the importance of linguistic knowledge and analysis in LLM safety research, an aspect that hasn’t been at the center stage but clearly should be,” says Jessy Li, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved with this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is funded, in part, by a Bridgewater AIA Labs Fellowship, the National Science Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, a Google Research Award, and Schmidt Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) sometimes learn the wrong lessons, according to an MIT study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than answering a query based on domain knowledge, an LLM could respond by leveraging grammatical patterns it learned during training. This can cause a model to fail unexpectedly when deployed on new tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that models can mistakenly link certain sentence patterns to specific topics, so an LLM might give a convincing answer by recognizing familiar phrasing instead of understanding the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their experiments showed that even the most powerful LLMs can make this mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shortcoming could reduce the reliability of LLMs that perform tasks like handling customer inquiries, summarizing clinical notes, and generating financial reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also have safety risks. A nefarious actor could exploit this to trick LLMs into producing harmful content, even when the models have safeguards to prevent such responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After identifying this phenomenon and exploring its implications, the researchers developed a benchmarking procedure to evaluate a model’s reliance on these incorrect correlations. The procedure could help developers mitigate the problem before deploying LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a byproduct of how we train models, but models are now used in practice in safety-critical domains far beyond the tasks that created these syntactic failure modes. If you’re not familiar with model training as an end-user, this is likely to be unexpected,” says Marzyeh Ghassemi, an associate professor in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), a member of the MIT Institute of Medical Engineering Sciences and the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghassemi is joined by co-lead authors Chantal Shaib, a graduate student at Northeastern University and visiting student at MIT; and Vinith Suriyakumar, an MIT graduate student; as well as Levent Sagun, a research scientist at Meta; and Byron Wallace, the Sy and Laurie Sternberg Interdisciplinary Associate Professor and associate dean of research at Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences.
