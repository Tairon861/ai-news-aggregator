New research from NTT DATA outlines a playbook that shows how these “AI leaders” set themselves apart through strong plans, firm decisions, and a disciplined approach to building and using AI across their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come from a survey of 2,567 senior executives in 35 countries and 15 industries. Only 15% of the organisations met the bar to be considered AI leaders. These companies share a few traits: clear direction on where AI fits into their business, a solid operating model, and consistent follow-through. They also reported higher revenue growth and stronger profit margins than everyone else in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yutaka Sasaki, President and CEO of NTT DATA Group, put it simply: “AI accountability now belongs in the boardroom and demands an enterprise-wide agenda. Our research shows that a small group of AI leaders already are using AI to differentiate, grow and reinvent how humans and machines create value together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-playbook-behind-strong-ai-plans"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The playbook behind strong AI plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest differences between leaders and the rest is how they approach strategy. For these companies, AI is not a side project or a tool bolted onto existing work. They treat it as a core driver of growth and adjust their plans to match that view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major advantage for these leaders is how closely they connect AI with their business goals. This alignment helps them move faster and stay focused, which in turn delivers stronger financial outcomes. They also zero in on a few high-value areas of the business rather than spreading resources too thin. By redesigning entire workflows around AI, they unlock more value than if they had only made small improvements in scattered parts of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report describes this as a kind of flywheel: early investments bring early wins, which then encourage more investment. Over time, this cycle becomes self-reinforcing. Leaders also rebuild important applications with AI embedded inside them, instead of adding basic AI features on top of old systems. This approach helps them see deeper impact and prepares the organisation for long-term gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-leaders-put-their-plans-to-work"&gt;How leaders put their plans to work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good plan only works when backed by strong execution. AI leaders stand out through the foundations they build, the way they support their people, and how they drive adoption across the entire organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These companies invest in secure and scalable systems that can support large AI workloads. In some cases, they shift or localise their infrastructure to support private or sovereign AI needs. They also work to remove system bottlenecks so teams can move without roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than using AI as a replacement for workers, leaders use it to help experienced employees do higher-value work. This “expert-first” approach allows teams to use their judgment while letting AI handle complex or time-consuming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI leaders also focus on adoption as a long-term change effort. They treat it as a company-wide shift, supported by clear communication and structured change management. This helps reduce pushback and encourages steady use of AI at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governance is another major difference. Leading organisations centralise their AI oversight, give clear responsibility to senior roles such as Chief AI Officers, and build processes that help balance innovation with risk. These systems allow them to scale AI more confidently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnerships also play a major role. Top companies often bring in outside experts and are open to arrangements that tie outcomes to shared success. This helps them move faster while keeping their goals in view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhijit Dubey, CEO and CAIO of NTT DATA, Inc., summarised the path forward: “Once AI and business strategies are aligned, the single most effective move is to pick one or two domains that deliver disproportionate value and redesign them end-to-end with AI. Supporting this focused, end-to-end approach with strong governance, modern infrastructure and trusted partners is how today’s AI leaders are turning pilots into profit and pulling ahead of the market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Igor Omilaev)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: OpenAI: Enterprise users swap AI pilots for deep integrations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111234" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-4.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The proprietary (and still secret) particles could counteract all the greenhouse gases the world has emitted over the last 150 years, the company stated in a 2023 pitch deck it presented to venture capital firms. In fact, it’s the “only technologically feasible solution” to climate change, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company disclosed it raised $60 million in funding in October, marking by far the largest known funding round to date for a startup working on solar geoengineering.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Stardust is, in a sense, the embodiment of Silicon Valley’s simmering frustration with the pace of academic research on the technology. It’s a multimillion-dollar bet that a startup mindset can advance research and development that has crept along amid scientific caution and public queasiness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But numerous researchers focused on solar geoengineering are deeply skeptical that Stardust will line up the government customers it would need to carry out a global deployment as early as 2035, the plan described in its earlier investor materials—and aghast at the suggestion that it ever expected to move that fast. They’re also highly critical of the idea that a company would take on the high-stakes task of setting the global temperature, rather than leaving it to publicly funded research programs.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“They’ve ignored every recommendation from everyone and think they can turn a profit in this field,” says Douglas MacMartin, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies solar geoengineering. “I think it’s going to backfire. Their investors are going to be dumping their money down the drain, and it will set back the field.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company has finally emerged from stealth mode after completing its funding round, and its CEO, Yanai Yedvab, agreed to conduct one of the company’s first extensive interviews with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yedvab walked back those ambitious projections a little, stressing that the actual timing of any stratospheric experiments, demonstrations, or deployments will be determined by when governments decide it’s appropriate to carry them out. Stardust has stated clearly that it will move ahead with solar geoengineering only if nations pay it to proceed, and only once there are established rules and bodies guiding the use of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That decision, he says, will likely be dictated by how bad climate change becomes in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It could be a situation where we are at the place we are now, which is definitely not great,” he says. “But it could be much worse. We’re saying we’d better be ready.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not for us to decide, and I’ll say humbly, it’s not for these researchers to decide,” he adds. “It’s the sense of urgency that will dictate how this will evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The building blocks&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one is questioning the scientific credentials of Stardust. The company was founded in 2023 by a trio of prominent researchers, including Yedvab, who served as deputy chief scientist at the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission. The company’s lead scientist, Eli Waxman, is the head of the department of particle physics and astrophysics at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Amyad Spector, the chief product officer, was previously a nuclear physicist at Israel’s secretive Negev Nuclear Research Center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1129080" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yanai-Amyad-Stardust-Labs-and-Offices-pic-9.jpg?w=2048" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Stardust CEO Yanai Yedvab (right) and Chief Product Officer Amyad Spector (left) at the company's facility in Israel. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ROBY YAHAV, STARDUST&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stardust says it employs 25 scientists, engineers, and academics. The company is based in Ness Ziona, Israel, and plans to open a US headquarters soon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the motivation for starting Stardust was simply to help develop an effective means of addressing climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“Maybe something in our experience, in the tool set that we bring, can help us in contributing to solving one of the greatest problems humanity faces,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lowercarbon Capital, the climate-tech-focused investment firm&amp;nbsp; cofounded by the prominent tech investor Chris Sacca, led the $60 million investment round. Future Positive, Future Ventures, and Never Lift Ventures, among others, participated as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWZ Ventures, a firm focused on security and intelligence technologies, co-led the company’s earlier seed round, which totaled $15 million.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the company will use that money to advance research, development, and testing for the three components of its system, which are also described in the pitch deck: safe particles that could be affordably manufactured; aircraft dispersion systems; and a means of tracking particles and monitoring their effects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Essentially, the idea is to develop all these building blocks and to upgrade them to a level that will allow us to give governments the tool set and all the required information to make decisions about whether and how to deploy this solution,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company is, in many ways, the opposite of Make Sunsets, the first company that came along offering to send particles into the stratosphere—for a fee—by pumping sulfur dioxide into weather balloons and hand-releasing them into the sky. Many researchers viewed it as a provocative, unscientific, and irresponsible exercise in attention-gathering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Stardust is serious, and now it’s raised serious money from serious people—all of which raises the stakes for the solar geoengineering field and, some fear, increases the odds that the world will eventually put the technology to use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“That marks a turning point in that these types of actors are not only possible, but are real,” says Shuchi Talati, executive director of the Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering, a nonprofit that strives to ensure that developing nations are included in the global debate over such climate interventions. “We’re in a more dangerous era now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many scientists studying solar geoengineering argue strongly that universities, governments, and transparent nonprofits should lead the work in the field, given the potential dangers and deep public concerns surrounding a tool with the power to alter the climate of the planet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s essential to carry out the research with appropriate oversight, explore the potential downsides of these approaches, and publicly publish the results “to ensure there’s no bias in the findings and no ulterior motives in pushing one way or another on deployment or not,” MacMartin says. “[It] shouldn’t be foisted upon people without proper and adequate information.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He criticized, for instance, the company’s claims to have developed a perfectly safe and inert “magic aerosol particle,” arguing that such a promise can’t be trusted without published findings. Other scientists have also disputed those scientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of other academics say solar geoengineering shouldn’t be studied at all, fearing that merely investigating it starts the world down a slippery slope toward its use and diminishes the pressures to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. In 2022, hundreds of them signed an open letter calling for a global ban on the development and use of the technology, adding the concern that there is no conceivable way for the world’s nations to pull together to establish rules or make collective decisions ensuring that it would be used in “a fair, inclusive, and effective manner.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Solar geoengineering is not necessary,” the authors wrote. “Neither is it desirable, ethical, or politically governable in the current context.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The for-profit decision&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust says it’s important to pursue the possibility of solar geoengineering because the dangers of climate change are accelerating faster than the world’s ability to respond to it, requiring a new “class of solution … that buys us time and protects us from overheating.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says he and his colleagues thought hard about the right structure for the organization, finally deciding that for-profits working in parallel with academic researchers have delivered “most of the groundbreaking technologies” in recent decades. He cited advances in genome sequencing, space exploration, and drug development, as well as the restoration of the ozone layer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He added that a for-profit structure was also required to raise funds and attract the necessary talent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There is no way we could, unfortunately, raise even a small portion of this amount by philanthropic resources or grants these days,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He adds that while academics have conducted lots of basic science in solar geoengineering, they’ve done very little in terms of building the technological capacities. Their geoengineering research is also primarily focused on the potential use of sulfur dioxide, because it is known to help reduce global temperatures after volcanic eruptions blast massive amounts of it into the stratospheric. But it has well-documented downsides as well, including harm to the protective ozone layer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It seems natural that we need better options, and this is why we started Stardust: to develop this safe, practical, and responsible solution,” the company said in a follow-up email. “Eventually, policymakers will need to evaluate and compare these options, and we’re confident that our option will be superior over sulfuric acid primarily in terms of safety and practicability.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Public trust can be won not by excluding private companies, but by setting up regulations and organizations to oversee this space, much as the US Food and Drug Administration does for pharmaceuticals, Yedvab says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no way this field could move forward if you don’t have this governance framework, if you don’t have external validation, if you don’t have clear regulation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the company says it intends to operate transparently, pledging to publish its findings whether they’re favorable or not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That will include finally revealing details about the particles it has developed, Yedvab says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early next year, the company and its collaborators will begin publishing data or evidence “substantiating all the claims and disclosing all the information,” he says, “so that everyone in the scientific community can actually check whether we checked all these boxes.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the follow-up email, the company acknowledged that solar geoengineering isn’t a “silver bullet” but said it is “the only tool that will enable us to cool the planet in the short term, as part of a larger arsenal of technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The only way governments could be in a position to consider [solar geoengineering] is if the work has been done to research, de-risk, and engineer safe and responsible solutions—which is what we see as our role,” the company added later. “We are hopeful that research will continue not just from us, but also from academic institutions, nonprofits, and other responsible companies that may emerge in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ambitious projections&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust’s earlier pitch deck stated that the company expected to conduct its first “stratospheric aerial experiments” last year, though those did not move ahead (more on that in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On another slide, the company said it expected to carry out a “large-scale demonstration” around 2030 and proceed to a “global full-scale deployment” by about 2035. It said it expected to bring in roughly $200 million and $1.5 billion in annual revenue by those periods, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every researcher interviewed for this story was adamant that such a deployment should not happen so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the global but uneven and unpredictable impacts of solar geoengineering, any decision to use the technology should be reached through an inclusive, global agreement, not through the unilateral decisions of individual nations, Talati argues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We won’t have any sort of international agreement by that point given where we are right now,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A global agreement, to be clear, is a big step beyond setting up rules and oversight bodies—and some believe that such an agreement on a technology so divisive could never be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s also still a vast amount of research that must be done to better understand the negative side effects of solar geoengineering generally and any ecological impacts of Stardust’s materials specifically, adds Holly Buck, an associate professor at the University of Buffalo and author of &lt;em&gt;After Geoengineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It is irresponsible to talk about deploying stratospheric aerosol injection without fundamental research about its impacts,” Buck wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She says the timelines are also “unrealistic” because there are profound public concerns about the technology. Her polling work found that a significant fraction of the US public opposes even research (though polling varies widely).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, most academic efforts to move ahead with even small-scale outdoor experiments have sparked fierce backlash. That includes the years-long effort by researchers then at Harvard to carry out a basic equipment test for their so-called ScopeX experiment. The high-altitude balloon would have launched from a flight center in Sweden, but the test was ultimately scratched amid objections from environmentalists and Indigenous groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given this baseline of public distrust, Stardust’s for-profit proposals only threaten to further inflame public fears, Buck says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I find the whole proposal incredibly socially naive,” she says. “We actually could use serious research in this field, but proposals like this diminish the chances of that happening.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those public fears, which cross the political divide, also mean politicians will see little to no political upside to paying Stardust to move ahead, MacMartin says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have the constituency for research, it seems implausible to me that you’d turn around and give money to an Israeli company to deploy it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An added risk is that if one nation or a small coalition forges ahead without broader agreement, it could provoke geopolitical conflicts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What if Russia wants it a couple of degrees warmer, and India a couple of degrees cooler?” asked Alan Robock, a professor at Rutgers University, in the &lt;em&gt;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&lt;/em&gt; in 2008. “Should global climate be reset to preindustrial temperature or kept constant at today’s reading? Would it be possible to tailor the climate of each region of the planet independently without affecting the others? If we proceed with geoengineering, will we provoke future climate wars?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Revised plans&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the pitch deck reflected Stardust’s strategy at a “very early stage in our work,” adding that their thinking has “evolved,” partly in response to consultations with experts in the field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says that the company will have the technological capacity to move ahead with demonstrations and deployments on the timelines it laid out but adds, “That’s a necessary but not sufficient condition.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Governments will need to decide where they want to take it, if at all,” he says. “It could be a case that they will say ‘We want to move forward.’ It could be a case that they will say ‘We want to wait a few years.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s for them to make these decisions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab acknowledges that the company has conducted flights in the lower atmosphere to test its monitoring system, using white smoke as a simulant for its particles, as the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported last year. It’s also done indoor tests of the dispersion system and its particles in a wind tunnel set up within its facility.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But in response to criticisms like the ones above, Yedvab says the company hasn’t conducted outdoor particle experiments and won’t move forward with them until it has approval from governments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Eventually, there will be a need to conduct outdoor testing,” he says. “There is no way you can validate any solution without outdoor testing.” But such testing of sunlight reflection technology, he says, “should be done only working together with government and under these supervisions.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Generating returns &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust may be willing to wait for governments to be ready to deploy its system, but there’s no guarantee that its investors will have the same patience. In accepting tens of millions in venture capital, Stardust may now face financial pressures that could “drive the timelines,” says Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that raises a different set of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Obliged to deliver returns, the company might feel it must strive to convince government leaders that they should pay for its services, Talati says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The whole point of having companies and investors is you want your thing to be used,” she says. “There’s a massive incentive to lobby countries to use it, and that’s the whole danger of having for-profit companies here.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She argues those financial incentives threaten to accelerate the use of solar geoengineering ahead of broader international agreements and elevate business interests above the broader public good.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust has “quietly begun lobbying on Capitol Hill” and has hired the law firm Holland &amp;amp; Knight, according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It has also worked with Red Duke Strategies, a consulting firm based in McLean, Virginia, to develop “strategic relationships and communications that promote understanding and enable scientific testing,” according to a case study on the company’s&amp;nbsp; website.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The company needed to secure both buy-in and support from the United States government and other influential stakeholders to move forward,” Red Duke states. “This effort demanded a well-connected and authoritative partner who could introduce Stardust to a group of experts able to research, validate, deploy, and regulate its SRM technology.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Red Duke didn’t respond to an inquiry from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. Stardust says its work with the consulting firm was not a government lobbying effort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab acknowledges that the company is meeting with government leaders in the US, Europe, its own region, and the Global South. But he stresses that it’s not asking any country to contribute funding or to sign off on deployments at this stage. Instead, it’s making the case for nations to begin crafting policies to regulate solar geoengineering.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When we speak to policymakers—and we speak to policymakers; we don’t hide it—essentially, what we tell them is ‘Listen, there is a solution,’” he says. “‘It’s not decades away—it’s a few years away. And it’s your role as policymakers to set the rules of this field.’”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Any solution needs checks and balances,” he says. “This is how we see the checks and balances.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says the best-case scenario is still a rollout of clean energy technologies that accelerates rapidly enough to drive down emissions and curb climate change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We are perfectly fine with building an option that will sit on the shelf,” he says. “We’ll go and do something else. We have a great team and are confident that we can find also other problems to work with.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says the company’s investors are aware of and comfortable with that possibility, supportive of the principles that will guide Stardust’s work, and willing to wait for regulations and government contracts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowercarbon Capital didn’t respond to an inquiry from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Sentiment of hope’&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Others have certainly imagined the alternative scenario Yedvab raises: that nations will increasingly support the idea of geoengineering in the face of mounting climate catastrophes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Kim Stanley Robinson’s 2020 novel, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ministry for the Future&lt;/em&gt;, India unilaterally forges ahead with solar geoengineering following a heat wave that kills millions of people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wagner sketched a variation on that scenario in his 2021 book, &lt;em&gt;Geoengineering: The Gamble&lt;/em&gt;, speculating that a small coalition of nations might kick-start a rapid research and deployment program as an emergency response to escalating humanitarian crises. In his version, the Philippines offers to serve as the launch site after a series of super-cyclones batter the island nation, forcing millions from their homes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know today how the world will react if one nation or a few go it alone, or whether nations could come to agreement on where the global temperature should be set.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the lure of solar geoengineering could become increasingly enticing as more and more nations endure mass suffering, starvation, displacement, and death.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We understand that probably it will not be perfect,” Yedvab says. “We understand all the obstacles, but there is this sentiment of hope, or cautious hope, that we have a way out of this dark corridor we are currently in.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I think that this sentiment of hope is something that gives us a lot of energy to move on forward,” he adds.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change—for a price.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects&amp;nbsp; nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The proprietary (and still secret) particles could counteract all the greenhouse gases the world has emitted over the last 150 years, the company stated in a 2023 pitch deck it presented to venture capital firms. In fact, it’s the “only technologically feasible solution” to climate change, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company disclosed it raised $60 million in funding in October, marking by far the largest known funding round to date for a startup working on solar geoengineering.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Stardust is, in a sense, the embodiment of Silicon Valley’s simmering frustration with the pace of academic research on the technology. It’s a multimillion-dollar bet that a startup mindset can advance research and development that has crept along amid scientific caution and public queasiness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But numerous researchers focused on solar geoengineering are deeply skeptical that Stardust will line up the government customers it would need to carry out a global deployment as early as 2035, the plan described in its earlier investor materials—and aghast at the suggestion that it ever expected to move that fast. They’re also highly critical of the idea that a company would take on the high-stakes task of setting the global temperature, rather than leaving it to publicly funded research programs.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“They’ve ignored every recommendation from everyone and think they can turn a profit in this field,” says Douglas MacMartin, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies solar geoengineering. “I think it’s going to backfire. Their investors are going to be dumping their money down the drain, and it will set back the field.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company has finally emerged from stealth mode after completing its funding round, and its CEO, Yanai Yedvab, agreed to conduct one of the company’s first extensive interviews with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yedvab walked back those ambitious projections a little, stressing that the actual timing of any stratospheric experiments, demonstrations, or deployments will be determined by when governments decide it’s appropriate to carry them out. Stardust has stated clearly that it will move ahead with solar geoengineering only if nations pay it to proceed, and only once there are established rules and bodies guiding the use of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That decision, he says, will likely be dictated by how bad climate change becomes in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It could be a situation where we are at the place we are now, which is definitely not great,” he says. “But it could be much worse. We’re saying we’d better be ready.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not for us to decide, and I’ll say humbly, it’s not for these researchers to decide,” he adds. “It’s the sense of urgency that will dictate how this will evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The building blocks&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one is questioning the scientific credentials of Stardust. The company was founded in 2023 by a trio of prominent researchers, including Yedvab, who served as deputy chief scientist at the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission. The company’s lead scientist, Eli Waxman, is the head of the department of particle physics and astrophysics at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Amyad Spector, the chief product officer, was previously a nuclear physicist at Israel’s secretive Negev Nuclear Research Center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1129080" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yanai-Amyad-Stardust-Labs-and-Offices-pic-9.jpg?w=2048" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Stardust CEO Yanai Yedvab (right) and Chief Product Officer Amyad Spector (left) at the company's facility in Israel. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ROBY YAHAV, STARDUST&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stardust says it employs 25 scientists, engineers, and academics. The company is based in Ness Ziona, Israel, and plans to open a US headquarters soon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the motivation for starting Stardust was simply to help develop an effective means of addressing climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“Maybe something in our experience, in the tool set that we bring, can help us in contributing to solving one of the greatest problems humanity faces,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lowercarbon Capital, the climate-tech-focused investment firm&amp;nbsp; cofounded by the prominent tech investor Chris Sacca, led the $60 million investment round. Future Positive, Future Ventures, and Never Lift Ventures, among others, participated as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWZ Ventures, a firm focused on security and intelligence technologies, co-led the company’s earlier seed round, which totaled $15 million.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the company will use that money to advance research, development, and testing for the three components of its system, which are also described in the pitch deck: safe particles that could be affordably manufactured; aircraft dispersion systems; and a means of tracking particles and monitoring their effects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Essentially, the idea is to develop all these building blocks and to upgrade them to a level that will allow us to give governments the tool set and all the required information to make decisions about whether and how to deploy this solution,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company is, in many ways, the opposite of Make Sunsets, the first company that came along offering to send particles into the stratosphere—for a fee—by pumping sulfur dioxide into weather balloons and hand-releasing them into the sky. Many researchers viewed it as a provocative, unscientific, and irresponsible exercise in attention-gathering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Stardust is serious, and now it’s raised serious money from serious people—all of which raises the stakes for the solar geoengineering field and, some fear, increases the odds that the world will eventually put the technology to use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“That marks a turning point in that these types of actors are not only possible, but are real,” says Shuchi Talati, executive director of the Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering, a nonprofit that strives to ensure that developing nations are included in the global debate over such climate interventions. “We’re in a more dangerous era now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many scientists studying solar geoengineering argue strongly that universities, governments, and transparent nonprofits should lead the work in the field, given the potential dangers and deep public concerns surrounding a tool with the power to alter the climate of the planet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s essential to carry out the research with appropriate oversight, explore the potential downsides of these approaches, and publicly publish the results “to ensure there’s no bias in the findings and no ulterior motives in pushing one way or another on deployment or not,” MacMartin says. “[It] shouldn’t be foisted upon people without proper and adequate information.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He criticized, for instance, the company’s claims to have developed a perfectly safe and inert “magic aerosol particle,” arguing that such a promise can’t be trusted without published findings. Other scientists have also disputed those scientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of other academics say solar geoengineering shouldn’t be studied at all, fearing that merely investigating it starts the world down a slippery slope toward its use and diminishes the pressures to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. In 2022, hundreds of them signed an open letter calling for a global ban on the development and use of the technology, adding the concern that there is no conceivable way for the world’s nations to pull together to establish rules or make collective decisions ensuring that it would be used in “a fair, inclusive, and effective manner.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Solar geoengineering is not necessary,” the authors wrote. “Neither is it desirable, ethical, or politically governable in the current context.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The for-profit decision&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust says it’s important to pursue the possibility of solar geoengineering because the dangers of climate change are accelerating faster than the world’s ability to respond to it, requiring a new “class of solution … that buys us time and protects us from overheating.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says he and his colleagues thought hard about the right structure for the organization, finally deciding that for-profits working in parallel with academic researchers have delivered “most of the groundbreaking technologies” in recent decades. He cited advances in genome sequencing, space exploration, and drug development, as well as the restoration of the ozone layer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He added that a for-profit structure was also required to raise funds and attract the necessary talent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There is no way we could, unfortunately, raise even a small portion of this amount by philanthropic resources or grants these days,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He adds that while academics have conducted lots of basic science in solar geoengineering, they’ve done very little in terms of building the technological capacities. Their geoengineering research is also primarily focused on the potential use of sulfur dioxide, because it is known to help reduce global temperatures after volcanic eruptions blast massive amounts of it into the stratospheric. But it has well-documented downsides as well, including harm to the protective ozone layer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It seems natural that we need better options, and this is why we started Stardust: to develop this safe, practical, and responsible solution,” the company said in a follow-up email. “Eventually, policymakers will need to evaluate and compare these options, and we’re confident that our option will be superior over sulfuric acid primarily in terms of safety and practicability.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Public trust can be won not by excluding private companies, but by setting up regulations and organizations to oversee this space, much as the US Food and Drug Administration does for pharmaceuticals, Yedvab says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no way this field could move forward if you don’t have this governance framework, if you don’t have external validation, if you don’t have clear regulation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the company says it intends to operate transparently, pledging to publish its findings whether they’re favorable or not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That will include finally revealing details about the particles it has developed, Yedvab says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early next year, the company and its collaborators will begin publishing data or evidence “substantiating all the claims and disclosing all the information,” he says, “so that everyone in the scientific community can actually check whether we checked all these boxes.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the follow-up email, the company acknowledged that solar geoengineering isn’t a “silver bullet” but said it is “the only tool that will enable us to cool the planet in the short term, as part of a larger arsenal of technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The only way governments could be in a position to consider [solar geoengineering] is if the work has been done to research, de-risk, and engineer safe and responsible solutions—which is what we see as our role,” the company added later. “We are hopeful that research will continue not just from us, but also from academic institutions, nonprofits, and other responsible companies that may emerge in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ambitious projections&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust’s earlier pitch deck stated that the company expected to conduct its first “stratospheric aerial experiments” last year, though those did not move ahead (more on that in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On another slide, the company said it expected to carry out a “large-scale demonstration” around 2030 and proceed to a “global full-scale deployment” by about 2035. It said it expected to bring in roughly $200 million and $1.5 billion in annual revenue by those periods, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every researcher interviewed for this story was adamant that such a deployment should not happen so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the global but uneven and unpredictable impacts of solar geoengineering, any decision to use the technology should be reached through an inclusive, global agreement, not through the unilateral decisions of individual nations, Talati argues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We won’t have any sort of international agreement by that point given where we are right now,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A global agreement, to be clear, is a big step beyond setting up rules and oversight bodies—and some believe that such an agreement on a technology so divisive could never be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s also still a vast amount of research that must be done to better understand the negative side effects of solar geoengineering generally and any ecological impacts of Stardust’s materials specifically, adds Holly Buck, an associate professor at the University of Buffalo and author of &lt;em&gt;After Geoengineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It is irresponsible to talk about deploying stratospheric aerosol injection without fundamental research about its impacts,” Buck wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She says the timelines are also “unrealistic” because there are profound public concerns about the technology. Her polling work found that a significant fraction of the US public opposes even research (though polling varies widely).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, most academic efforts to move ahead with even small-scale outdoor experiments have sparked fierce backlash. That includes the years-long effort by researchers then at Harvard to carry out a basic equipment test for their so-called ScopeX experiment. The high-altitude balloon would have launched from a flight center in Sweden, but the test was ultimately scratched amid objections from environmentalists and Indigenous groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given this baseline of public distrust, Stardust’s for-profit proposals only threaten to further inflame public fears, Buck says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I find the whole proposal incredibly socially naive,” she says. “We actually could use serious research in this field, but proposals like this diminish the chances of that happening.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those public fears, which cross the political divide, also mean politicians will see little to no political upside to paying Stardust to move ahead, MacMartin says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have the constituency for research, it seems implausible to me that you’d turn around and give money to an Israeli company to deploy it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An added risk is that if one nation or a small coalition forges ahead without broader agreement, it could provoke geopolitical conflicts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What if Russia wants it a couple of degrees warmer, and India a couple of degrees cooler?” asked Alan Robock, a professor at Rutgers University, in the &lt;em&gt;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&lt;/em&gt; in 2008. “Should global climate be reset to preindustrial temperature or kept constant at today’s reading? Would it be possible to tailor the climate of each region of the planet independently without affecting the others? If we proceed with geoengineering, will we provoke future climate wars?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Revised plans&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the pitch deck reflected Stardust’s strategy at a “very early stage in our work,” adding that their thinking has “evolved,” partly in response to consultations with experts in the field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says that the company will have the technological capacity to move ahead with demonstrations and deployments on the timelines it laid out but adds, “That’s a necessary but not sufficient condition.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Governments will need to decide where they want to take it, if at all,” he says. “It could be a case that they will say ‘We want to move forward.’ It could be a case that they will say ‘We want to wait a few years.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s for them to make these decisions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab acknowledges that the company has conducted flights in the lower atmosphere to test its monitoring system, using white smoke as a simulant for its particles, as the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported last year. It’s also done indoor tests of the dispersion system and its particles in a wind tunnel set up within its facility.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But in response to criticisms like the ones above, Yedvab says the company hasn’t conducted outdoor particle experiments and won’t move forward with them until it has approval from governments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Eventually, there will be a need to conduct outdoor testing,” he says. “There is no way you can validate any solution without outdoor testing.” But such testing of sunlight reflection technology, he says, “should be done only working together with government and under these supervisions.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Generating returns &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust may be willing to wait for governments to be ready to deploy its system, but there’s no guarantee that its investors will have the same patience. In accepting tens of millions in venture capital, Stardust may now face financial pressures that could “drive the timelines,” says Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that raises a different set of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Obliged to deliver returns, the company might feel it must strive to convince government leaders that they should pay for its services, Talati says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The whole point of having companies and investors is you want your thing to be used,” she says. “There’s a massive incentive to lobby countries to use it, and that’s the whole danger of having for-profit companies here.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She argues those financial incentives threaten to accelerate the use of solar geoengineering ahead of broader international agreements and elevate business interests above the broader public good.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust has “quietly begun lobbying on Capitol Hill” and has hired the law firm Holland &amp;amp; Knight, according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It has also worked with Red Duke Strategies, a consulting firm based in McLean, Virginia, to develop “strategic relationships and communications that promote understanding and enable scientific testing,” according to a case study on the company’s&amp;nbsp; website.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The company needed to secure both buy-in and support from the United States government and other influential stakeholders to move forward,” Red Duke states. “This effort demanded a well-connected and authoritative partner who could introduce Stardust to a group of experts able to research, validate, deploy, and regulate its SRM technology.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Red Duke didn’t respond to an inquiry from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. Stardust says its work with the consulting firm was not a government lobbying effort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab acknowledges that the company is meeting with government leaders in the US, Europe, its own region, and the Global South. But he stresses that it’s not asking any country to contribute funding or to sign off on deployments at this stage. Instead, it’s making the case for nations to begin crafting policies to regulate solar geoengineering.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When we speak to policymakers—and we speak to policymakers; we don’t hide it—essentially, what we tell them is ‘Listen, there is a solution,’” he says. “‘It’s not decades away—it’s a few years away. And it’s your role as policymakers to set the rules of this field.’”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Any solution needs checks and balances,” he says. “This is how we see the checks and balances.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says the best-case scenario is still a rollout of clean energy technologies that accelerates rapidly enough to drive down emissions and curb climate change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We are perfectly fine with building an option that will sit on the shelf,” he says. “We’ll go and do something else. We have a great team and are confident that we can find also other problems to work with.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says the company’s investors are aware of and comfortable with that possibility, supportive of the principles that will guide Stardust’s work, and willing to wait for regulations and government contracts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowercarbon Capital didn’t respond to an inquiry from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Sentiment of hope’&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Others have certainly imagined the alternative scenario Yedvab raises: that nations will increasingly support the idea of geoengineering in the face of mounting climate catastrophes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Kim Stanley Robinson’s 2020 novel, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ministry for the Future&lt;/em&gt;, India unilaterally forges ahead with solar geoengineering following a heat wave that kills millions of people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wagner sketched a variation on that scenario in his 2021 book, &lt;em&gt;Geoengineering: The Gamble&lt;/em&gt;, speculating that a small coalition of nations might kick-start a rapid research and deployment program as an emergency response to escalating humanitarian crises. In his version, the Philippines offers to serve as the launch site after a series of super-cyclones batter the island nation, forcing millions from their homes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know today how the world will react if one nation or a few go it alone, or whether nations could come to agreement on where the global temperature should be set.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the lure of solar geoengineering could become increasingly enticing as more and more nations endure mass suffering, starvation, displacement, and death.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We understand that probably it will not be perfect,” Yedvab says. “We understand all the obstacles, but there is this sentiment of hope, or cautious hope, that we have a way out of this dark corridor we are currently in.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I think that this sentiment of hope is something that gives us a lot of energy to move on forward,” he adds.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/10/1129079/how-one-controversial-startup-hopes-to-cool-the-planet/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Securing VMware workloads in regulated industries (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/10/1128475/securing-vmware-workloads-in-regulated-industries/</link><description>&lt;section class="sponsoredModule__wrapper--c8f6fcf4edb2dcd3a940a2824bb850dc sponsoredModule__minimalist--f63b84a37007076f51d0ebb0dc1af42f"&gt;&lt;p class="sponsoredModule__intro--e69c514244f1e38617e4ec5ea754fb7f"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In partnership with&lt;/span&gt;RapidScale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="image__wrapper--373a87c0cefdc42b3a8bd26457571412"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background opacity"&gt;&lt;span class="image__img--e1a73f503bf0f4a3d2504e1d64ea29cb imgLazyLoaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image__meta--16eb0f8dde685315ba1d77ae67c89391"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a regional hospital, a cardiac patient’s lab results sit behind layers of encryption, accessible to his surgeon but shielded from those without strictly need-to-know status.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as a reasoning engine, “agents” act as the hands, capable of executing complex, multi-step workflows with minimal supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, however, visibility into how these tools are actually being utilised in the wild has been opaque, relying largely on speculative frameworks or limited surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New data released by Perplexity, analysing hundreds of millions of interactions with its Comet browser and assistant, provides a first large-scale field study of general-purpose AI agents. The data indicates that agentic AI is already being deployed by high-value knowledge workers to streamline productivity and research tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding who is using these tools is essential for forecasting internal demand and identifying potential shadow IT vectors. The study reveals marked heterogeneity in adoption. Users in nations with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment are far more likely to engage with agentic tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More telling for corporate planning is the occupational breakdown. Adoption is heavily concentrated in digital and knowledge-intensive sectors. The ‘Digital Technology’ cluster represents the largest share, accounting for 28 percent of adopters and 30 percent of queries. This is followed closely by academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these clusters account for over 70 percent of total adopters. This suggests that the individuals most likely to leverage agentic workflows are the most expensive assets within an organisation: software engineers, financial analysts, and market strategists. These early adopters are not dabbling; the data shows that “power users” (those with earlier access) make nine times as many agentic queries as average users, indicating that once integrated into a workflow, the technology becomes indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-agents-partners-for-enterprise-tasks-not-butlers"&gt;AI agents: Partners for enterprise tasks, not butlers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To advance beyond marketing narratives, enterprises must understand the utility these agents provide. A common view suggests agents will primarily function as “digital concierges” for rote administrative chores. However, the data challenges this view: 57 percent of all agent activity focuses on cognitive work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perplexity’s researchers developed a “hierarchical agentic taxonomy” to classify user intent, revealing the usage of AI agents is practical rather than experimental. The dominant use case is ‘Productivity &amp;amp; Workflow,’ which accounts for 36 percent of all agentic queries. This is followed by ‘Learning &amp;amp; Research’ at 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific anecdotes from the study illustrate how this translates to enterprise value. A procurement professional, for instance, used the assistant to scan customer case studies and identify relevant use cases before engaging with a vendor. Similarly, a finance worker delegated the tasks of filtering stock options and analysing investment information. In these scenarios, the agent handles the information gathering and initial synthesis autonomously to allow the human to focus on final judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distribution provides a definite indication to operational leaders: the immediate ROI for agentic AI lies in scaling human capability rather than simply automating low-level friction. The study defines these agents as systems that “cycle automatically between three iterative phases to achieve the end goal: thinking, acting, and observing.” This capability allows them to support “deep cognitive work,” acting as a thinking partner rather than a simple butler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stickiness-and-the-cognitive-migration"&gt;Stickiness and the cognitive migration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key insight for IT leaders is the “stickiness” of AI agents for enterprise workflows. The data shows that in the short term, users exhibit strong within-topic persistence. If a user engages an agent for a productivity task, their subsequent queries are highly likely to remain in that domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the user journey often evolves. New users frequently “test the waters” with low-stakes queries, such as asking for movie recommendations or general trivia. Over time, a transition occurs. The study notes that while users may enter via various use cases, query shares tend to migrate toward cognitively oriented domains like productivity, learning, and career development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a user employs an agent to debug code or summarise a financial report, they rarely revert to lower-value tasks. The ‘Productivity’ and ‘Workflow’ categories demonstrate the highest retention rates. This behaviour implies that early pilot programmes should anticipate a learning curve where usage matures from simple information retrieval to complex task delegation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “where” of agentic AI is just as important as the “what”. Perplexity’s study tracked the environments – specific websites and platforms – where these AI agents operate. The concentration of activity varies by task, but the top environments are staples of the modern enterprise stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Docs is a primary environment for document and spreadsheet editing, while LinkedIn dominates professional networking tasks. For ‘Learning &amp;amp; Research,’ the activity is split between course platforms like Coursera and research repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CISOs and compliance officers, this presents a new risk profile. AI agents are not just reading data; they are actively manipulating it within core enterprise applications. The study explicitly defines agentic queries as those involving “browser control” or actions on external applications via APIs. When an employee tasks an agent to “summarise these customer case studies,” the agent is interacting directly with proprietary data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concentration of environments also highlights the potential for platform-specific optimisations. For instance, the top five environments account for 96 percent of queries in professional networking, primarily on LinkedIn. This high concentration suggests that businesses could see immediate efficiency gains by developing specific governance policies or API connectors for these high-traffic platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-business-planning-for-agentic-ai-following-perplexity-s-data"&gt;Business planning for agentic AI following Perplexity’s data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diffusion of capable AI agents invites new lines of inquiry for business planning. The data from Perplexity confirms that we have passed the speculative phase. Agents are currently being used to plan and execute multi-step actions, modifying their environments rather than just exchanging information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational leaders should consider three immediate actions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit the productivity and workflow &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;friction points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; within high-value teams:&lt;/strong&gt; The data shows this is where agents are naturally finding their foothold. If software engineers and financial analysts are already using these tools to edit documents or manage accounts, formalising these workflows could standardise efficiency gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for the augmentation reality: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers note that while agents have autonomy, users often break tasks into smaller pieces, delegating only subtasks. This suggests that the immediate future of work is collaborative, requiring employees to be upskilled in how to effectively “manage” their AI counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address the infrastructure and security layer:&lt;/strong&gt; With agents operating in “open-world web environments” and interacting with sites like GitHub and corporate email, the perimeter for data loss prevention expands. Policies must distinguish between a chatbot offering advice and an agent executing code or sending messages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the market for agentic AI is projected to grow from $8 billion in 2025 to $199 billion by 2034, the early evidence from Perplexity serves as a bellwether. The transition to enterprise workflows led by AI agents is underway, driven by the most digitally capable segments of the workforce. The challenge for the enterprise is to harness this momentum without losing control of the governance required to scale it safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accenture and Anthropic partner to boost enterprise AI integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111183" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as a reasoning engine, “agents” act as the hands, capable of executing complex, multi-step workflows with minimal supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, however, visibility into how these tools are actually being utilised in the wild has been opaque, relying largely on speculative frameworks or limited surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New data released by Perplexity, analysing hundreds of millions of interactions with its Comet browser and assistant, provides a first large-scale field study of general-purpose AI agents. The data indicates that agentic AI is already being deployed by high-value knowledge workers to streamline productivity and research tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding who is using these tools is essential for forecasting internal demand and identifying potential shadow IT vectors. The study reveals marked heterogeneity in adoption. Users in nations with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment are far more likely to engage with agentic tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More telling for corporate planning is the occupational breakdown. Adoption is heavily concentrated in digital and knowledge-intensive sectors. The ‘Digital Technology’ cluster represents the largest share, accounting for 28 percent of adopters and 30 percent of queries. This is followed closely by academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these clusters account for over 70 percent of total adopters. This suggests that the individuals most likely to leverage agentic workflows are the most expensive assets within an organisation: software engineers, financial analysts, and market strategists. These early adopters are not dabbling; the data shows that “power users” (those with earlier access) make nine times as many agentic queries as average users, indicating that once integrated into a workflow, the technology becomes indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-agents-partners-for-enterprise-tasks-not-butlers"&gt;AI agents: Partners for enterprise tasks, not butlers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To advance beyond marketing narratives, enterprises must understand the utility these agents provide. A common view suggests agents will primarily function as “digital concierges” for rote administrative chores. However, the data challenges this view: 57 percent of all agent activity focuses on cognitive work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perplexity’s researchers developed a “hierarchical agentic taxonomy” to classify user intent, revealing the usage of AI agents is practical rather than experimental. The dominant use case is ‘Productivity &amp;amp; Workflow,’ which accounts for 36 percent of all agentic queries. This is followed by ‘Learning &amp;amp; Research’ at 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific anecdotes from the study illustrate how this translates to enterprise value. A procurement professional, for instance, used the assistant to scan customer case studies and identify relevant use cases before engaging with a vendor. Similarly, a finance worker delegated the tasks of filtering stock options and analysing investment information. In these scenarios, the agent handles the information gathering and initial synthesis autonomously to allow the human to focus on final judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distribution provides a definite indication to operational leaders: the immediate ROI for agentic AI lies in scaling human capability rather than simply automating low-level friction. The study defines these agents as systems that “cycle automatically between three iterative phases to achieve the end goal: thinking, acting, and observing.” This capability allows them to support “deep cognitive work,” acting as a thinking partner rather than a simple butler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stickiness-and-the-cognitive-migration"&gt;Stickiness and the cognitive migration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key insight for IT leaders is the “stickiness” of AI agents for enterprise workflows. The data shows that in the short term, users exhibit strong within-topic persistence. If a user engages an agent for a productivity task, their subsequent queries are highly likely to remain in that domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the user journey often evolves. New users frequently “test the waters” with low-stakes queries, such as asking for movie recommendations or general trivia. Over time, a transition occurs. The study notes that while users may enter via various use cases, query shares tend to migrate toward cognitively oriented domains like productivity, learning, and career development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a user employs an agent to debug code or summarise a financial report, they rarely revert to lower-value tasks. The ‘Productivity’ and ‘Workflow’ categories demonstrate the highest retention rates. This behaviour implies that early pilot programmes should anticipate a learning curve where usage matures from simple information retrieval to complex task delegation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “where” of agentic AI is just as important as the “what”. Perplexity’s study tracked the environments – specific websites and platforms – where these AI agents operate. The concentration of activity varies by task, but the top environments are staples of the modern enterprise stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Docs is a primary environment for document and spreadsheet editing, while LinkedIn dominates professional networking tasks. For ‘Learning &amp;amp; Research,’ the activity is split between course platforms like Coursera and research repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CISOs and compliance officers, this presents a new risk profile. AI agents are not just reading data; they are actively manipulating it within core enterprise applications. The study explicitly defines agentic queries as those involving “browser control” or actions on external applications via APIs. When an employee tasks an agent to “summarise these customer case studies,” the agent is interacting directly with proprietary data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concentration of environments also highlights the potential for platform-specific optimisations. For instance, the top five environments account for 96 percent of queries in professional networking, primarily on LinkedIn. This high concentration suggests that businesses could see immediate efficiency gains by developing specific governance policies or API connectors for these high-traffic platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-business-planning-for-agentic-ai-following-perplexity-s-data"&gt;Business planning for agentic AI following Perplexity’s data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diffusion of capable AI agents invites new lines of inquiry for business planning. The data from Perplexity confirms that we have passed the speculative phase. Agents are currently being used to plan and execute multi-step actions, modifying their environments rather than just exchanging information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational leaders should consider three immediate actions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit the productivity and workflow &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;friction points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; within high-value teams:&lt;/strong&gt; The data shows this is where agents are naturally finding their foothold. If software engineers and financial analysts are already using these tools to edit documents or manage accounts, formalising these workflows could standardise efficiency gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for the augmentation reality: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers note that while agents have autonomy, users often break tasks into smaller pieces, delegating only subtasks. This suggests that the immediate future of work is collaborative, requiring employees to be upskilled in how to effectively “manage” their AI counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address the infrastructure and security layer:&lt;/strong&gt; With agents operating in “open-world web environments” and interacting with sites like GitHub and corporate email, the perimeter for data loss prevention expands. Policies must distinguish between a chatbot offering advice and an agent executing code or sending messages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the market for agentic AI is projected to grow from $8 billion in 2025 to $199 billion by 2034, the early evidence from Perplexity serves as a bellwether. The transition to enterprise workflows led by AI agents is underway, driven by the most digitally capable segments of the workforce. The challenge for the enterprise is to harness this momentum without losing control of the governance required to scale it safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accenture and Anthropic partner to boost enterprise AI integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111183" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Five teams were asked to validate answers to more than 1,000 business requirements completed by SAP’s AI co-pilot, Joule for Consultants — a workload that would normally take several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four teams were told the analysis had been completed by junior interns fresh out of school. They reviewed the material, found it impressive, and rated the work about 95% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth team was told the very same answers had come from AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They rejected almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only when asked to validate each answer one by one did they discover that the AI was, in fact, highly accurate — surfacing detailed insights the consultants had initially dismissed. The overall accuracy? Again, about 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lesson learned here is that we need to be very cautious as we introduce AI — especially in how we communicate with senior consultants about its possibilities and how to integrate it into their workflows,” says Guillermo B. Vazquez Mendez, chief architect, RI business transformation and architecture, SAP America Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment has since become a revealing starting point for SAP’s push toward the consultant of 2030: a practitioner who is deeply human, enabled by AI, and no longer weighed down by the technical grunt work of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overcoming AI skepticism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance isn’t surprising, Vazquez notes. Consultants with two or three decades of experience carry enormous institutional knowledge — and an understandable degree of caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But AI copilots like Joule for Consultants are not replacing expertise. They’re amplifying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What Joule really does is make their very expensive time far more effective,” Vazquez says. “It removes the clerical work, so they can focus on turning out high-quality answers in a fraction of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes this message constantly: “AI is not replacing you. It’s a tool for you. Human oversight is always required. But now, instead of spending your time looking for documentation, you’re gaining significant time and boosting the effectiveness and detail of your answers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The consultant time-shift: from tech execution to business insight&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, consultants spent about 80% of their time understanding technical systems — how processes run, how data flows, how functions execute. Customers, by contrast, spend 80% of their time focused on their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mismatch is exactly where Joule steps in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a gap there — and the bridge is AI,” Vazquez says. “It flips the time equation, enabling consultants to invest more of their energy in understanding the customer’s industry and business goals. AI takes on the heavy technical lift, so consultants can focus on driving the right business outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bringing new consultants up to speed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is also transforming how new hires learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited to see Joule acting as a bridge between senior consultants, who are adapting more slowly, and interns and new consultants who are already technically savvy,” Vazquez says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior consultants ramp up faster because Joule helps them operate independently. Seniors, meanwhile, engage where their insight matters most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also where many consultants learn the fundamentals of today’s AI copilots. Much of the work depends on prompt engineering — for instance, instructing Joule to act as a senior chief technology architect specializing in finance and SAP S/4HANA 2023, then asking it to analyze business requirements and deliver the output as tables or PowerPoint slides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they grasp how to frame prompts, consultants consistently get higher-quality, more structured answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New architects are also able to communicate more clearly with their more experienced counterparts. They know what they don’t know and can ask targeted questions, which makes mentorship far smoother. It’s created a real synergy, Vazquez adds — senior consultants see how quickly new hires are adapting and learning with AI, and that momentum encourages them to keep pace and adopt the technology themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking ahead to the future of AI copilots&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re still in the baby steps of AI — we’re toddlers,” Vazquez says. “Right now, copilots depend on prompt engineering to get good answers. The better you prompt, the better the answer you get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that represents only the earliest phase of what these systems will eventually do. As copilots mature, they’ll move beyond responding to prompts and start interpreting entire business processes — understanding the sequence of steps, identifying where human intervention is needed, and spotting where an AI agent could take over. That shift is what leads directly into agentic AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAP’s depth of process knowledge is what makes that evolution possible. The company has mapped more than 3,500 business processes across industries — a repository Vazquez calls “some of the most valuable, rigorously tested processes developed in the last 50 years.” Every day, SAP systems support roughly $7.3 trillion in global commerce, giving these emerging AI agents a rich foundation to navigate and reason over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With that level of process insight and data, we can take a real leap forward,” he says, “equipping our consultants with agentic AI that can solve complex challenges and push us toward increasingly autonomous systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
