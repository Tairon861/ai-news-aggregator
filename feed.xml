I’ve outlined in many stories and newsletters that AC is a significant contributor to global electricity demand, and it’s only going to suck up more power as temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I’ll also be the first to admit that it can be a life-saving technology, one that may become even more necessary as climate change intensifies. And in the wake of Europe’s recent deadly heat wave, it’s been oddly villainized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;We should all be aware of the growing electricity toll of air-conditioning, but the AC hate is misplaced. Yes, AC is energy intensive, but so is heating our homes, something that’s rarely decried in the same way that cooling is. Both are tools for comfort and, more important, for safety. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;So why is air-conditioning cast as &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a villain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the last days of June and the first few days of July, temperatures hit record highs across Europe. Over 2,300 deaths during that period were attributed to the heat wave, according to early research from World Weather Attribution, an academic collaboration that studies extreme weather. And human-caused climate change accounted for 1,500 of the deaths, the researchers found. (That is, the number of fatalities would have been under 800 if not for higher temperatures because of climate change.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;We won’t have the official death toll for months, but these early figures show just how deadly heat waves can be. &lt;strong&gt;Europe is especially vulnerable, because in many countries, particularly in the northern part of the continent, air-conditioning is not common.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Popping on a fan, drawing the shades, or opening the windows on the hottest days used to cut it in many European countries. Not anymore. The UK was 1.24 °C (2.23 °F) warmer over the past decade than it was between 1961 and 1990, according to the Met Office, the UK’s national climate and weather service. One recent study found that homes across the country are uncomfortably or dangerously warm much more frequently than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The reality is, some parts of the world are seeing an upward shift in temperatures that’s not just uncomfortable but dangerous. &lt;strong&gt;As a result, air-conditioning usage is going up all over the world, including in countries with historically low rates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reaction to this long-term trend, especially in the face of the recent heat wave, has been apoplectic. People are decrying AC across social media and opinion pages, arguing that we need to suck it up and deal with being a little bit uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, let me preface this by saying that I do live in the US, where roughly 90% of homes are cooled with air-conditioning today. So perhaps I am a little biased in favor of AC. But it baffles me when people talk about air-conditioning this way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I spent a good amount of my childhood in the southeastern US, where it’s very obvious that heat can be dangerous. I was used to many days where temperatures were well above 90 °F (32 °C), and the humidity was so high your clothes would stick to you as soon as you stepped outdoors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, being active or working in those conditions can lead to heatstroke. Prolonged exposure, even if it’s not immediately harmful, can lead to heart and kidney problems. Older people, children, and those with chronic conditions can be more vulnerable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, air-conditioning is more than a convenience; in certain conditions, it’s a safety measure. That should be an easy enough concept to grasp. After all, in many parts of the world we expect access to heating in the name of safety. Nobody wants to freeze to death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And it’s important to clarify here that while air-conditioning does use a lot of electricity in the US, heating actually has a higher energy footprint.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the US, about 19% of residential electricity use goes to air-conditioning.&lt;/strong&gt; That sounds like a lot, and it’s significantly more than the 12% of electricity that goes to space heating. However, we need to zoom out to get the full picture, because electricity makes up only part of a home’s total energy demand. A lot of homes in the US use natural gas for heating—that’s not counted in the electricity being used, but it’s certainly part of the home’s total energy use.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we look at the total, space heating accounts for a full 42% of residential energy consumption in the US, while air conditioning accounts for only 9%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m not letting AC off the hook entirely here. There’s obviously a difference between running air-conditioning (or other, less energy-intensive technologies) when needed to stay safe and blasting systems at max capacity because you prefer it chilly. And there’s a lot of grid planning we’ll need to do to make sure we can handle the expected influx of air-conditioning around the globe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the world is changing, and temperatures are rising. If you’re looking for a villain, look beyond the air conditioner and into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

The moves come as Salesforce simultaneously restricts external AI companies from accessing Slack data, creating a walled garden approach that mirrors broader industry trends toward platform consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unlike some AI tools that sit outside the flow of work, Slack’s AI shows up where work happens – across conversations, decisions, and documentation,” said Shalini Agarwal, Vice President of Slack Product at Salesforce, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “The key differentiator is context, which comes in the form of structured and unstructured data in Slack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing underscores intensifying competition in the $45 billion enterprise collaboration market, where Microsoft’s Teams platform and its Copilot AI assistant have gained significant traction against Slack since Salesforce’s $27.7 billion acquisition of the messaging service in 2021. Google is also pushing its Duet AI across Workspace applications, creating a three-way battle for corporate customers increasingly focused on AI-driven productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-slack-s-contextual-ai-works-inside-workplace-conversations"&gt;How Slack’s contextual AI works inside workplace conversations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slack’s new capabilities depart from traditional AI assistant models that require users to actively prompt for help. Instead, the platform will proactively surface relevant information and automate routine tasks within existing workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI writing assistance, launching soon within Slack’s canvas feature, will allow teams to automatically generate project briefs from conversation threads, extract action items from brainstorming sessions, and reformat meeting notes into structured updates. When combined with Slack’s existing AI-powered meeting transcription in huddles, the feature creates an end-to-end documentation workflow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI needs to feel easy and seamless, and you shouldn’t have to work hard to use it,” Agarwal told VentureBeat. “Since the release of AI in Slack, customers have summarized more than 600 million messages, saving a collective 1.1 million hours across users.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more intriguingly, Slack will introduce contextual message explanations that activate when users hover over unfamiliar terms, acronyms, or project references. The feature draws from the organization’s unique vocabulary and conversation history stored within Slack, potentially solving a persistent onboarding and cross-team collaboration challenge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ever hit an unfamiliar acronym or bit of jargon in a Slack message? That moment of confusion, of searching or asking, slows everything down,” the company noted in its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-search-becomes-the-new-battleground-for-workplace-data"&gt;Enterprise search becomes the new battleground for workplace data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of Slack’s AI strategy is enterprise search, now generally available, which allows users to query information across connected applications including Salesforce, Microsoft Teams, Google Drive, Confluence, and Box from a single interface within Slack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The capability addresses a persistent productivity drain in modern workplaces, where employees spend an estimated 41% of their time on repetitive tasks like searching for information across disconnected systems, according to Slack’s research. By positioning Slack as the unified search interface for enterprise data, Salesforce is making a bold play to become the primary workspace hub for knowledge workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than building point-to-point connections between applications, Slack is positioning itself as the universal translator for workplace information. The approach acknowledges a harsh reality: most organizations have accepted that their data will remain scattered across dozens of applications, but they desperately need a better way to find and use that information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For IT departments, Slack promises minimal deployment complexity. “Generally, it should be a light lift for IT teams,” Agarwal said. “Connectors will be out of the box as they become available. Once admins enable an app, and users authenticate to it, results will be available immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-salesforce-is-blocking-ai-competitors-from-accessing-slack-data"&gt;Why Salesforce is blocking AI competitors from accessing Slack data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even as Slack opens its search capabilities to customers’ connected applications, Salesforce has been aggressively restricting how external AI companies access Slack data. In May, the company amended its API terms of service to prohibit bulk data exports and explicitly ban using Slack data to train large language models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move affects third-party AI search companies like Glean, which had been indexing Slack conversations alongside other enterprise data sources to provide unified search experiences. Under the new restrictions, such companies can only access Slack data through real-time search APIs with significant limitations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce is making a calculated gamble. By restricting access to Slack data, the company is betting that its own AI capabilities will prove superior to external alternatives. But enterprise customers have consistently shown they prefer choice and flexibility over forced vendor lock-in. If competing AI platforms deliver significantly better results using data from other sources, Salesforce risks pushing customers toward alternative messaging platforms that offer more open integration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The restrictions underscore how valuable workplace conversation data has become. With over 5 billion messages exchanged weekly on Slack, the platform contains what Agarwal describes as “the history of your company, and all the information across teams and projects.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This conversational data offers something unique in the enterprise software landscape: unstructured, context-rich information about how work actually gets done, rather than formal documentation about how it should get done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-security-concerns-drive-ai-trust-and-compliance-features"&gt;Enterprise security concerns drive AI trust and compliance features&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce has built its AI capabilities around what it calls “the Einstein Trust Layer,” emphasizing that customer data never leaves the company’s infrastructure or trains external AI models. The approach addresses enterprise concerns about data sovereignty that have slowed AI adoption in regulated industries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Protecting our customers’ data is Slack’s top priority,” Agarwal said. “Customer data stays in-house, Slack does not share customer data with LLM providers, and Slack does not use customer data to train LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform’s AI features inherit Slack’s existing enterprise-grade security controls, including support for FedRAMP compliance, encryption key management, and international data residency requirements. Search results automatically respect existing user permissions across connected applications, preventing unauthorized data exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-customer-results-show-measurable-productivity-gains-from-ai-features"&gt;Early customer results show measurable productivity gains from AI features&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early customer results suggest meaningful productivity gains, though the sample size remains limited. Salesforce’s internal engineering team reports that its AI agent has handled over 18,000 conversations across 3,500 users in six months, potentially saving the equivalent of eight full-time employees worth of work annually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other customers report similar metrics. OpenTable handled 73% of restaurant web queries using Salesforce’s Agentforce AI in just three weeks, while payment processor Engine reduced average handle time by 15% and projects $2 million in annual cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These early results, while promising, should be viewed with appropriate skepticism. Productivity measurements in enterprise software often suffer from selection bias, where only the most successful implementations generate public case studies. The true test of Slack’s AI capabilities will come as adoption scales beyond early adopters to mainstream enterprise customers with more complex, less standardized workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-slack-s-ai-strategy-compares-to-microsoft-copilot-and-google-workspace"&gt;How Slack’s AI strategy compares to Microsoft Copilot and Google Workspace&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The announcements position Slack more directly against Microsoft’s comprehensive AI strategy, which includes Copilot integration across the Office 365 suite and Teams platform. Microsoft’s approach has gained significant enterprise traction, with the company reporting that Copilot adoption is driving workplace productivity gains across its customer base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Slack’s conversational-first approach may offer advantages for organizations where informal communication drives decision-making. “Slack’s conversational interface and rich context make it a very natural home for AI agents,” Agarwal noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company is also extending its reach through new pricing strategies, including significant government discounts that mirror Google’s competitive tactics. In May, Salesforce announced up to 90% discounts for federal agencies through November, replacing fragmented agency-by-agency negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-autonomous-ai-agents-in-workplace-collaboration"&gt;The future of autonomous AI agents in workplace collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agarwal’s vision extends beyond current capabilities toward autonomous AI agents that can execute complex workflows across multiple systems. “Our vision for an agentic work operating system is that everyone can bring AI, agents, customer data, team collaboration, and connected systems into a single place so they can work faster and smarter,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company recently launched Agentforce in Slack, bringing task-specific digital teammates that can update CRM records, post in channels, and assist with employee onboarding. Early results show Salesforce’s sales team saving 66,000 hours annually through AI assistance with deal insights and executive briefings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI capabilities become table stakes for enterprise software, Slack’s success may depend on execution rather than innovation. The platform’s strength lies in its position as the de facto standard for workplace messaging, providing the conversational context that makes AI responses more relevant and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether this contextual advantage proves sustainable against Microsoft’s integrated ecosystem and Google’s search expertise remains an open question. But for now, Salesforce is betting that the future of work happens in conversations — and that whoever controls those conversations controls the workplace AI market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new AI features will be included in all paid Slack plans, with advanced capabilities reserved for higher-tier subscriptions. Enterprise+ customers will receive the full AI experience, including enterprise search and governance controls designed for large-scale deployment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprise decision-makers evaluating AI collaboration tools, Slack’s approach offers a compelling alternative to Microsoft’s suite-wide integration strategy. The question is whether contextual AI within conversations can compete with the broader productivity gains promised by AI assistants embedded across entire software ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

The moves come as Salesforce simultaneously restricts external AI companies from accessing Slack data, creating a walled garden approach that mirrors broader industry trends toward platform consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unlike some AI tools that sit outside the flow of work, Slack’s AI shows up where work happens – across conversations, decisions, and documentation,” said Shalini Agarwal, Vice President of Slack Product at Salesforce, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “The key differentiator is context, which comes in the form of structured and unstructured data in Slack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing underscores intensifying competition in the $45 billion enterprise collaboration market, where Microsoft’s Teams platform and its Copilot AI assistant have gained significant traction against Slack since Salesforce’s $27.7 billion acquisition of the messaging service in 2021. Google is also pushing its Duet AI across Workspace applications, creating a three-way battle for corporate customers increasingly focused on AI-driven productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-slack-s-contextual-ai-works-inside-workplace-conversations"&gt;How Slack’s contextual AI works inside workplace conversations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slack’s new capabilities depart from traditional AI assistant models that require users to actively prompt for help. Instead, the platform will proactively surface relevant information and automate routine tasks within existing workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI writing assistance, launching soon within Slack’s canvas feature, will allow teams to automatically generate project briefs from conversation threads, extract action items from brainstorming sessions, and reformat meeting notes into structured updates. When combined with Slack’s existing AI-powered meeting transcription in huddles, the feature creates an end-to-end documentation workflow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI needs to feel easy and seamless, and you shouldn’t have to work hard to use it,” Agarwal told VentureBeat. “Since the release of AI in Slack, customers have summarized more than 600 million messages, saving a collective 1.1 million hours across users.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more intriguingly, Slack will introduce contextual message explanations that activate when users hover over unfamiliar terms, acronyms, or project references. The feature draws from the organization’s unique vocabulary and conversation history stored within Slack, potentially solving a persistent onboarding and cross-team collaboration challenge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ever hit an unfamiliar acronym or bit of jargon in a Slack message? That moment of confusion, of searching or asking, slows everything down,” the company noted in its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-search-becomes-the-new-battleground-for-workplace-data"&gt;Enterprise search becomes the new battleground for workplace data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of Slack’s AI strategy is enterprise search, now generally available, which allows users to query information across connected applications including Salesforce, Microsoft Teams, Google Drive, Confluence, and Box from a single interface within Slack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The capability addresses a persistent productivity drain in modern workplaces, where employees spend an estimated 41% of their time on repetitive tasks like searching for information across disconnected systems, according to Slack’s research. By positioning Slack as the unified search interface for enterprise data, Salesforce is making a bold play to become the primary workspace hub for knowledge workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than building point-to-point connections between applications, Slack is positioning itself as the universal translator for workplace information. The approach acknowledges a harsh reality: most organizations have accepted that their data will remain scattered across dozens of applications, but they desperately need a better way to find and use that information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For IT departments, Slack promises minimal deployment complexity. “Generally, it should be a light lift for IT teams,” Agarwal said. “Connectors will be out of the box as they become available. Once admins enable an app, and users authenticate to it, results will be available immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-salesforce-is-blocking-ai-competitors-from-accessing-slack-data"&gt;Why Salesforce is blocking AI competitors from accessing Slack data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even as Slack opens its search capabilities to customers’ connected applications, Salesforce has been aggressively restricting how external AI companies access Slack data. In May, the company amended its API terms of service to prohibit bulk data exports and explicitly ban using Slack data to train large language models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move affects third-party AI search companies like Glean, which had been indexing Slack conversations alongside other enterprise data sources to provide unified search experiences. Under the new restrictions, such companies can only access Slack data through real-time search APIs with significant limitations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce is making a calculated gamble. By restricting access to Slack data, the company is betting that its own AI capabilities will prove superior to external alternatives. But enterprise customers have consistently shown they prefer choice and flexibility over forced vendor lock-in. If competing AI platforms deliver significantly better results using data from other sources, Salesforce risks pushing customers toward alternative messaging platforms that offer more open integration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The restrictions underscore how valuable workplace conversation data has become. With over 5 billion messages exchanged weekly on Slack, the platform contains what Agarwal describes as “the history of your company, and all the information across teams and projects.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This conversational data offers something unique in the enterprise software landscape: unstructured, context-rich information about how work actually gets done, rather than formal documentation about how it should get done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-security-concerns-drive-ai-trust-and-compliance-features"&gt;Enterprise security concerns drive AI trust and compliance features&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce has built its AI capabilities around what it calls “the Einstein Trust Layer,” emphasizing that customer data never leaves the company’s infrastructure or trains external AI models. The approach addresses enterprise concerns about data sovereignty that have slowed AI adoption in regulated industries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Protecting our customers’ data is Slack’s top priority,” Agarwal said. “Customer data stays in-house, Slack does not share customer data with LLM providers, and Slack does not use customer data to train LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform’s AI features inherit Slack’s existing enterprise-grade security controls, including support for FedRAMP compliance, encryption key management, and international data residency requirements. Search results automatically respect existing user permissions across connected applications, preventing unauthorized data exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-customer-results-show-measurable-productivity-gains-from-ai-features"&gt;Early customer results show measurable productivity gains from AI features&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early customer results suggest meaningful productivity gains, though the sample size remains limited. Salesforce’s internal engineering team reports that its AI agent has handled over 18,000 conversations across 3,500 users in six months, potentially saving the equivalent of eight full-time employees worth of work annually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other customers report similar metrics. OpenTable handled 73% of restaurant web queries using Salesforce’s Agentforce AI in just three weeks, while payment processor Engine reduced average handle time by 15% and projects $2 million in annual cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These early results, while promising, should be viewed with appropriate skepticism. Productivity measurements in enterprise software often suffer from selection bias, where only the most successful implementations generate public case studies. The true test of Slack’s AI capabilities will come as adoption scales beyond early adopters to mainstream enterprise customers with more complex, less standardized workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-slack-s-ai-strategy-compares-to-microsoft-copilot-and-google-workspace"&gt;How Slack’s AI strategy compares to Microsoft Copilot and Google Workspace&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The announcements position Slack more directly against Microsoft’s comprehensive AI strategy, which includes Copilot integration across the Office 365 suite and Teams platform. Microsoft’s approach has gained significant enterprise traction, with the company reporting that Copilot adoption is driving workplace productivity gains across its customer base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Slack’s conversational-first approach may offer advantages for organizations where informal communication drives decision-making. “Slack’s conversational interface and rich context make it a very natural home for AI agents,” Agarwal noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company is also extending its reach through new pricing strategies, including significant government discounts that mirror Google’s competitive tactics. In May, Salesforce announced up to 90% discounts for federal agencies through November, replacing fragmented agency-by-agency negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-autonomous-ai-agents-in-workplace-collaboration"&gt;The future of autonomous AI agents in workplace collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agarwal’s vision extends beyond current capabilities toward autonomous AI agents that can execute complex workflows across multiple systems. “Our vision for an agentic work operating system is that everyone can bring AI, agents, customer data, team collaboration, and connected systems into a single place so they can work faster and smarter,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company recently launched Agentforce in Slack, bringing task-specific digital teammates that can update CRM records, post in channels, and assist with employee onboarding. Early results show Salesforce’s sales team saving 66,000 hours annually through AI assistance with deal insights and executive briefings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI capabilities become table stakes for enterprise software, Slack’s success may depend on execution rather than innovation. The platform’s strength lies in its position as the de facto standard for workplace messaging, providing the conversational context that makes AI responses more relevant and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether this contextual advantage proves sustainable against Microsoft’s integrated ecosystem and Google’s search expertise remains an open question. But for now, Salesforce is betting that the future of work happens in conversations — and that whoever controls those conversations controls the workplace AI market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new AI features will be included in all paid Slack plans, with advanced capabilities reserved for higher-tier subscriptions. Enterprise+ customers will receive the full AI experience, including enterprise search and governance controls designed for large-scale deployment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprise decision-makers evaluating AI collaboration tools, Slack’s approach offers a compelling alternative to Microsoft’s suite-wide integration strategy. The question is whether contextual AI within conversations can compete with the broader productivity gains promised by AI assistants embedded across entire software ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

The new embryos contain the DNA of the intended parents along with a tiny fraction of mitochondrial DNA from the donor, floating in the embryos’ cytoplasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which makes use of a technology called mitochondrial donation, has been described as a “tour de force” and “a remarkable accomplishment” by others in the field.

AI won't thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

Only eight months since its launch, the startup has raised a $200 million Series A round led by Accel at a $1.8 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like Cursor and other platforms that help developers write code and build apps by harnessing the coding and reasoning abilities of large language models, Stockholm-based Lovable helps people use natural language to create websites and apps. The startup’s trajectory so far has charted straight toward the sky, with the company claiming it now has more than 2.3 million active users.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those users are using Lovable for free, to be clear, but in a recent talk, the startup’s CEO Anton Osika said it now has more than 180,000 paying subscribers, and the company had reached annual recurring revenues of $75 million in seven months. That traction likely contributed to this oversized Series A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Series A saw participation from existing investors, which include 20VC, byFounders, Creandum, Hummingbird, and Visionaries Club. In February, Creandum led a $15 million pre-series A round in the company, which at the time said it had reached annual recurring revenue of $17 million and had 30,000 paying customers, with “just $2 million spent.“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has managed this hockey-stick growth with a pretty sparse team of only 45 full-time employees. That’s almost as many as the high-profile angel investors who it said participated in this round, including Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Remote CEO Job van der Voort, Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield, and HubSpot co-founder Dharmesh Shah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most of Lovable’s traction seems to come from non-technical users, who use it to create prototypes that they can collaborate on later with developers to build more fleshed-out apps and websites. This, and tests, are likely the bulk of the 10 million projects that have been created on the platform to date, the company said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Lovable also envisions itself becoming a tool that can be used to create production-grade applications that underpin full-fledged businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

The financing comes just one month after the six-founder team graduated from Y Combinator’s Spring 2025 batch, underscoring investor appetite for infrastructure plays in the rapidly expanding AI agent market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based company is betting that the current generation of cloud providers — Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure — are fundamentally mismatched for the new wave of autonomous AI systems that can take actions without human intervention. These AI agents, which handle everything from managing calendars to generating code, require dramatically different infrastructure than traditional web applications built for human users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current cloud providers have been designed for the Web 2.0, Software as a Service era,” said Paul Sinaï, Blaxel’s co-founder and CEO, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “But with this new wave of agentic AI, we believe that there is a need for a new type of infrastructure which is dedicated to AI agents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing reflects a broader shift in enterprise computing as companies increasingly deploy AI agents for customer service, data processing, and workflow automation. Unlike traditional applications where databases sit alongside web servers in predictable patterns, AI agents create unique networking challenges by connecting to language models in one region, APIs in another cloud, and knowledge bases elsewhere—all while users expect instant responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blaxel has already demonstrated significant traction, processing millions of agent requests daily across 16 global regions by the end of their Y Combinator batch. One customer is running over 1 billion seconds of agent runtime to process millions of videos, representing a scale that illustrates the infrastructure demands of AI-first companies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One of our customers is processing session replays to enable product managers to understand better how the user behavior of their product,” Sinaï explained. “They need to process millions of session replays every month. So it represents millions of minutes of sessions. They are using our agentic infrastructure to process those session replays and provide insights for product managers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s approach centers on providing infrastructure that AI agents can operate themselves, rather than requiring human administrators. This includes sandboxed virtual machines that boot in under 25 milliseconds, automatic scaling based on agent activity patterns, and APIs designed to be consumed directly by AI systems rather than human developers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-six-co-founders-with-a-successful-exit-plan-to-take-on-big-tech"&gt;How six co-founders with a successful exit plan to take on Big Tech&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blaxel’s unusual six-founder structure stems from the team’s shared experience building and selling a previous company to OVHcloud, Europe’s largest cloud provider. That company became OVH’s entire analytics product suite, giving the team firsthand experience with both cloud infrastructure challenges and successful exits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I know it sounds unusual, pretty big team. We didn’t fit exactly on the stage for demo day,” Sinaï said, referencing Y Combinator’s signature event. “But we already did that. My previous company, which I sold to OVH cloud, we were also six co-founders.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team includes Charles Drappier, whom Sinaï has known for over 15 years, along with co-founders Christophe Ploujoux, Nicolas Lecomte, Thomas Crochet, and Mathis Joffre. Their collective experience spans infrastructure, developer tools, and platform engineering — critical expertise for competing against tech giants with virtually unlimited resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s important to be six right now, because we have a lot of ambition,” Sinaï said. “What we are doing is building this next generation of cloud computing for this new agentic era.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-sets-blaxel-apart-in-the-competitive-cloud-infrastructure-market"&gt;What sets Blaxel apart in the competitive cloud infrastructure market&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cloud infrastructure market is notoriously competitive, with AWS commanding roughly one-third market share and newer players like Modal, Replicate, and RunPod targeting AI workloads. Blaxel differentiates itself by focusing specifically on AI agents rather than model inference or training.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of the competitors you mentioned are solving a very difficult problem, which is around the inference — how you can host your model, how you can make those models as fast as you can in terms of number of tokens,” Sinaï said. “But there is not that many people working on infrastructure for the agents, and it’s exactly what we are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s platform includes three main components: agent hosting for deploying AI systems as serverless APIs, MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for connecting agents to external tools, and a unified gateway for accessing multiple AI models. The infrastructure is designed to handle the variable resource demands of AI agents, which might require minimal computing power while waiting for responses but need significant resources during active processing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-security-and-compliance-features-target-regulated-industries"&gt;Enterprise security and compliance features target regulated industries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite targeting younger AI-first companies, Blaxel has implemented enterprise-grade security measures including SOC2 and HIPAA compliance. The platform offers data residency controls that allow customers to restrict workloads to specific geographic regions—critical for companies in regulated industries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We provide a policy framework where you can attach, for example, to workloads to say, this agent cannot run outside of those subsets of regions,” Sinaï explained. “You can attach a policy to say this agent cannot run outside of the United States, so you are sure that this agent will process the data only in the regions you have chosen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach reflects the company’s belief that even early-stage AI companies need robust infrastructure practices because they’re building the enterprises of tomorrow. “We believe that it’s very important to have, even for young companies, the best infrastructure with the best practices, because they are going to become enterprises,” Sinaï said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pay-as-you-go-pricing-delivers-50-cost-savings-over-traditional-serverless"&gt;Pay-as-you-go pricing delivers 50% cost savings over traditional serverless&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blaxel has adopted a pay-as-you-go pricing model similar to established cloud providers, moving away from an initial subscription approach after validating market demand during their Y Combinator batch. The model charges customers only when their agents are actively processing tasks, shutting down infrastructure during idle periods to optimize costs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We provide infrastructure that spin up in just few milliseconds and shut down in just one second,” Sinaï said. “So you just pay for the time your agent is actually processing something. When your agent is waiting for something else, you don’t have to pay for it because we shut it down.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The approach has already delivered cost savings for customers, with one client achieving 50% cost reduction compared to typical serverless solutions while processing terabytes of data monthly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gartner-predicts-75-of-apps-will-use-ai-agents-by-2028"&gt;Gartner predicts 75% of apps will use AI agents by 2028&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investment comes as industry analysts predict explosive growth in AI agent adoption. Gartner forecasts that 75% of application development will involve AI agents by 2028, though Sinaï believes current enterprise adoption remains largely experimental.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Right now, most of companies working actively in production are mostly smaller companies, not yet enterprise companies,” he said. “So we are focusing really on serving them exactly like the big cloud providers did in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strategy mirrors how Amazon Web Services initially focused on startups and developer-friendly companies before expanding to enterprise customers. Blaxel plans to follow a similar path, using the $7.3 million to expand their software platform before potentially moving into custom hardware and data center optimization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Seven millions is not enough to build data centers, obviously, but I think it’s important to go step by step,” Sinaï said. “Being sure that right now we have the best interfaces we can provide to our customers, the best services for their agents, and then going into the deeper infrastructure optimization.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s roadmap includes features like snapshot forking for agent experimentation, automatic failover capabilities, and deeper optimization for the massive scale they anticipate. With projections of hundreds of billions of AI agents in the coming decades, Blaxel sees an opportunity to build infrastructure designed for this new computing paradigm from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We believe that there is a huge economy which is starting around the agents,” Sinaï said. “There are going to be hundreds of billions of AI agents, and the infrastructure we have today has not been designed for this new wave.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The funding round included participation from Y Combinator, Liquid2, Transpose, and angel investors who share the company’s vision of purpose-built agent infrastructure. As AI agents transition from experimental tools to production systems handling critical business processes, Blaxel’s specialized approach could position it to capture significant market share in what may become the next major category of cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;

That company became OVH’s entire analytics product suite, giving the team firsthand experience with both cloud infrastructure challenges and successful exits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I know it sounds unusual, pretty big team. We didn’t fit exactly on the stage for demo day,” Sinaï said, referencing Y Combinator’s signature event. “But we already did that. My previous company, which I sold to OVH cloud, we were also six co-founders.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team includes Charles Drappier, whom Sinaï has known for over 15 years, along with co-founders Christophe Ploujoux, Nicolas Lecomte, Thomas Crochet, and Mathis Joffre. Their collective experience spans infrastructure, developer tools, and platform engineering — critical expertise for competing against tech giants with virtually unlimited resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s important to be six right now, because we have a lot of ambition,” Sinaï said. “What we are doing is building this next generation of cloud computing for this new agentic era.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-sets-blaxel-apart-in-the-competitive-cloud-infrastructure-market"&gt;What sets Blaxel apart in the competitive cloud infrastructure market&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cloud infrastructure market is notoriously competitive, with AWS commanding roughly one-third market share and newer players like Modal, Replicate, and RunPod targeting AI workloads. Blaxel differentiates itself by focusing specifically on AI agents rather than model inference or training.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of the competitors you mentioned are solving a very difficult problem, which is around the inference — how you can host your model, how you can make those models as fast as you can in terms of number of tokens,” Sinaï said. “But there is not that many people working on infrastructure for the agents, and it’s exactly what we are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s platform includes three main components: agent hosting for deploying AI systems as serverless APIs, MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for connecting agents to external tools, and a unified gateway for accessing multiple AI models. The infrastructure is designed to handle the variable resource demands of AI agents, which might require minimal computing power while waiting for responses but need significant resources during active processing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-security-and-compliance-features-target-regulated-industries"&gt;Enterprise security and compliance features target regulated industries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite targeting younger AI-first companies, Blaxel has implemented enterprise-grade security measures including SOC2 and HIPAA compliance. The platform offers data residency controls that allow customers to restrict workloads to specific geographic regions—critical for companies in regulated industries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We provide a policy framework where you can attach, for example, to workloads to say, this agent cannot run outside of those subsets of regions,” Sinaï explained. “You can attach a policy to say this agent cannot run outside of the United States, so you are sure that this agent will process the data only in the regions you have chosen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach reflects the company’s belief that even early-stage AI companies need robust infrastructure practices because they’re building the enterprises of tomorrow. “We believe that it’s very important to have, even for young companies, the best infrastructure with the best practices, because they are going to become enterprises,” Sinaï said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pay-as-you-go-pricing-delivers-50-cost-savings-over-traditional-serverless"&gt;Pay-as-you-go pricing delivers 50% cost savings over traditional serverless&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blaxel has adopted a pay-as-you-go pricing model similar to established cloud providers, moving away from an initial subscription approach after validating market demand during their Y Combinator batch. The model charges customers only when their agents are actively processing tasks, shutting down infrastructure during idle periods to optimize costs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We provide infrastructure that spin up in just few milliseconds and shut down in just one second,” Sinaï said. “So you just pay for the time your agent is actually processing something. When your agent is waiting for something else, you don’t have to pay for it because we shut it down.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The approach has already delivered cost savings for customers, with one client achieving 50% cost reduction compared to typical serverless solutions while processing terabytes of data monthly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gartner-predicts-75-of-apps-will-use-ai-agents-by-2028"&gt;Gartner predicts 75% of apps will use AI agents by 2028&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investment comes as industry analysts predict explosive growth in AI agent adoption. Gartner forecasts that 75% of application development will involve AI agents by 2028, though Sinaï believes current enterprise adoption remains largely experimental.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Right now, most of companies working actively in production are mostly smaller companies, not yet enterprise companies,” he said. “So we are focusing really on serving them exactly like the big cloud providers did in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strategy mirrors how Amazon Web Services initially focused on startups and developer-friendly companies before expanding to enterprise customers. Blaxel plans to follow a similar path, using the $7.3 million to expand their software platform before potentially moving into custom hardware and data center optimization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Seven millions is not enough to build data centers, obviously, but I think it’s important to go step by step,” Sinaï said. “Being sure that right now we have the best interfaces we can provide to our customers, the best services for their agents, and then going into the deeper infrastructure optimization.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s roadmap includes features like snapshot forking for agent experimentation, automatic failover capabilities, and deeper optimization for the massive scale they anticipate. With projections of hundreds of billions of AI agents in the coming decades, Blaxel sees an opportunity to build infrastructure designed for this new computing paradigm from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We believe that there is a huge economy which is starting around the agents,” Sinaï said. “There are going to be hundreds of billions of AI agents, and the infrastructure we have today has not been designed for this new wave.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The funding round included participation from Y Combinator, Liquid2, Transpose, and angel investors who share the company’s vision of purpose-built agent infrastructure. As AI agents transition from experimental tools to production systems handling critical business processes, Blaxel’s specialized approach could position it to capture significant market share in what may become the next major category of cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google, and others are quietly scooping up and retaining user data to improve their models or monitor for safety and security, even in some enterprise contexts where companies assume their information is off limits. For highly regulated industries or companies building on the frontier, that gray area could be a dealbreaker. Fears about where data goes, who can see it, and how it might be used are slowing AI adoption in sectors like healthcare, finance, and government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Enter San Francisco-based startup Confident Security, which aims to be “the Signal for AI.” The company’s product, CONFSEC, is an end-to-end encryption tool that wraps around foundational models, guaranteeing that prompts and metadata can’t be stored, seen, or used for AI training, even by the model provider or any third party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The second that you give up your data to someone else, you’ve essentially reduced your privacy,” Jonathan Mortensen, founder and CEO of Confident Security, told TechCrunch. “And our product’s goal is to remove that trade-off.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Confident Security came out of stealth on Thursday with $4.2 million in seed funding from Decibel, South Park Commons, Ex Ante, and Swyx, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The company wants to serve as an intermediary vendor between AI vendors and their customers — like hyperscalers, governments, and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even AI companies could see the value in offering Confident Security’s tool to enterprise clients as a way to unlock that market, said Mortensen. He added that CONFSEC is also well-suited for new AI browsers hitting the market, like Perplexity’s recently released Comet, to give customers guarantees that their sensitive data isn’t being stored on a server somewhere that the company or bad actors could access, or that their work-related prompts aren’t being used to “train AI to do your job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CONFSEC is modeled after Apple’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC) architecture, which Mortensen says “is 10x better than anything out there in terms of guaranteeing that Apple cannot see your data” when it runs certain AI tasks securely in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like Apple’s PCC, Confident Security’s system works by first anonymizing data by encrypting and routing it through services like Cloudflare or Fastly, so servers never see the original source or content. Next, it uses advanced encryption that only allows decryption under strict conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“So you can say you’re only allowed to decrypt this if you are not going to log the data, and you’re not going to use it for training, and you’re not going to let anyone see it,” Mortensen said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, the software running the AI inference is publicly logged and open to review so that experts can verify its guarantees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Confident Security is ahead of the curve in recognizing that the future of AI depends on trust built into the infrastructure itself,” Jess Leão, partner at Decibel, said in a statement. “Without solutions like this, many enterprises simply can’t move forward with AI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s still early days for the year-old company, but Mortensen said CONFSEC has been tested, externally audited, and is production-ready. The team is in talks with banks, browsers, and search engines, among other potential clients, to add CONFSEC to their infrastructure stacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The new update includes a new “deep research” mode, native multilingual reasoning, and advanced image editing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The news comes a couple days after Mistral released Voxtral, its first open source AI audio model that’s capable of reasoning in multiple languages, transcription, and more. Voxtral is also available via Le Chat.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral says its new deep research mode, like those offered by rivals, turns Le Chat into a coordinated research assistant that can plan, clarify your needs, search, and synthesize data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What the model does is really go and look into a big variety of sources on the web to answer a specific question,” Mistral’s head of product, Elisa Salamanca, told TechCrunch. “We believe this feature is going to be very relevant for both consumer and enterprise use cases. For consumers, because it can research travel and provide an exhaustive analysis of the best travel plans. And for enterprise work, it can do exhaustive research.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the updates are available across all tiers — Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise — Salamanca notes that Mistral is focusing on integrating Le Chat and Mistral’s productivity suite into enterprise ecosystems with this release. That’s in large part because Mistral handles data connectors differently than competitors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A lot of customers who have very sensitive data don’t actually use cloud services, or if they do, they do it on their own premises with virtual private clouds,” Salamanca said, citing customers in banking, defense, and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To address this, Salamanca said Mistral’s Le Chat and productivity suite connect to enterprise data on-premises. In other words, companies can use Le Chat’s deep reasoning and other capabilities to analyze their own internal data without having to upload anything to the cloud. That’s a meaningful differentiator against cloud-native LLM platforms like OpenAI, which is Azure-hosted, and Gemini, which is Google Cloud-based. It also opens the door for Mistral to offer other productivity tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A big part of our value proposition, especially when we release Le Chat Enterprise, is that we want to make [things like] Microsoft Excel and Google Docs and that kind of office suite work seamlessly with our capabilities,” Salamanca said. “So the connectors that we release with Le Chat Enterprise are actually one step in that direction. We’re building these connectors internally because we believe this is going to be a key for using Le Chat as a productivity enabler in the business context.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aside from deep reasoning, Le Chat has gotten other updates today. While users have been able to use Le Chat to reason through complex questions via Magistral, Mistral’s new reasoning AI model, that capability was previously only available in English. Now Mistral natively supports multilingual reasoning in languages like French, Spanish, Japanese, and others. Mistral says Le Chat can also code-switch between languages midsentence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This latest update from Mistral also includes the addition of Projects, which helps users stay organized by grouping chats, documents, and ideas into focused spaces. Each project can have its own default library and remember which tools and settings a user has enabled. Mistral says use cases include planning a move, designing a new product feature, or keeping work-related projects on track.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, Le Chat is getting improved image-editing capabilities. This allows users to create and edit images with prompts like “remove the object” or “place me in another city.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new features put Mistral in a more competitive range with the AI industry’s frontrunners, positioning Le Chat as not just a model demo, but also a full-stack contender.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2147859992-e1713960898378.webp?resize=1200,676" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;French AI lab Mistral introduced a range of new features to its Le Chat chatbot on Thursday that bring it closer to the capabilities of rivals like OpenAI and Google.

After burning through US$46 billion on the metaverse with little to show for it, the Meta CEO is now doubling down with an even more ambitious wager: superintelligence AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, however, the stakes are higher, the competition more fierce, and the potential rewards more transformative than anything Meta has attempted before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With nine-figure compensation packages and infrastructure investments that dwarf even the metaverse spending spree, Zuckerberg’s superintelligence AI gamble represents Silicon Valley’s most expensive talent war – one that could either cement Meta’s position as a tech giant or become another cautionary tale of visionary ambition meeting harsh reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The birth of Meta Superintelligence Labs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formation of Meta Superintelligence Labs marks a shift for the social media giant. In an exclusive interview with &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;‘s TITV live-streaming programme, Zuckerberg told founder Jessica Lessin that “the most exciting thing this year is that we’re starting to see early glimpses of self-improvement with the models, which means that developing super intelligence is now in sight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision has driven the company to restructure its entire AI division, with the ambitious goal of delivering what Zuckerberg calls “personal super intelligence to everyone in the world.” The lab’s creation follows a period of internal struggles in Meta’s AI division, including management struggles, employee churn, and product releases that fell flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than incrementally improving existing systems, Zuckerberg has opted for a complete overhaul, bringing in external leadership and re-imagining the company’s approach to AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Are we witnessing the most expensive talent war in tech history?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to Meta’s superintelligence AI ambitions is a talent acquisition strategy that has sent shockwaves through the industry. Zuckerberg has embarked on a spending spree to create the new lab, offering as much as nine-figure pay packages to hire top researchers from companies like OpenAI, Google, Apple and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Information’s&lt;/em&gt; Lessin questioned reports of US$100-200 million compensation packages, Zuckerberg acknowledged the competitive nature of the market, stating that “a lot of the specifics that have been reported aren’t accurate by themselves. But it is a very hot market… there’s a small number of researchers, who are the best, who are in demand by all of the different labs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Meta AI talent acquisition strategy extends beyond financial incentives. Zuckerberg said having “basically the most compute per researcher is a strategic advantage, not just for doing the work, but for attracting the best people.” The approach reflects an understanding that in the superintelligence AI race, talent density matters more than team size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Alexandr Wang acquisition: A US$14.3b gamble&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centrepiece of Meta’s talent strategy was its acquisition of Scale AI leadership. In June, the company made a US$14.3 billion investment in the AI startup, founded and led by Wang. Under the deal, Meta took a 49% stake in the company, and Wang and a team of top Scale employees joined Meta in leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At just 28 years old, Alexandr Wang now serves as Meta’s chief AI officer, leading what the company has renamed “Meta Superintelligence Labs.” In the larger AI division, Wang has led a team of around a dozen newly-hired researchers, a handful of his deputies from Scale AI, and Nat Friedman, the former chief executive of GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration of Wang’s team as a re-imagining of how Meta approaches AI development. The group is working in an office space siloed from the rest of the company and next to Zuckerberg, highlighting the importance placed on the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A philosophical shift: From open source to closed development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant development emerging from Meta Superintelligence Labs is a potential abandonment of the company’s long-standing open-source philosophy. Last week, a small group of top members of the lab, including Wang, discussed abandoning the company’s most powerful open source AI model, called Behemoth, in favour of developing a closed model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a departure from Meta’s historical approach. For years, Meta has chosen to open source its AI models, making code public for other developers to build on. Meta executives have argued it is better for the technology to be built in public so that AI development will move faster and be accessible to more developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift reflects concerns about competitive positioning in the AI race. Meta had finished feeding data into its Behemoth model (training) but has delayed its release because of poor internal performance. The setback has prompted a serious reconsideration of the company’s approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure as a competitive advantage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond talent acquisition, Meta is making infrastructure investments to support its superintelligence ambitions. Zuckerberg revealed that the company is “building multiple, multi-gigawatt data centres” and pioneering new construction methods, including “weatherproof tents” to accelerate deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of these investments is staggering. Hyperion, one of Meta’s new data centres, “is going to scale up to five gigawatts over the coming years” and “the size of the site covers a significant portion of the footprint of Manhattan in terms of space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure spending is enabled by Meta’s strong financial position, with Zuckerberg noting that “we can basically do this all funded from the cash flow of the company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The personal superintelligence vision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes Meta’s approach from competitors is its focus on “personal superintelligence” rather than centralised AI systems. During his interview with &lt;em&gt;The Information’s&lt;/em&gt; Lessin, Zuckerberg explained that while other labs focus on “wanting to automate all of the economically productive work in society,” Meta’s vision centres on “what are the things that people care about in their own lives… relationships and culture and creativity and having fun and enjoying life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision extends to Meta’s hardware ambitions, particularly its AR glasses initiative. In the same TITV interview, Zuckerberg predicted that “if you don’t have AI glasses, you’re going to be at a cognitive disadvantage” and described future scenarios where AI companions could “observe what’s going on in your life and be able to follow up on things for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industry implications and competitive dynamics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of Meta’s superintelligence push extend beyond the company. Meta’s AI talent acquisition strategy has created salary inflation in the industry, forcing competitors to match or exceed Meta’s compensation levels to retain their researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about his interactions with competitors at Sun Valley, Zuckerberg acknowledged the competitive landscape, stating that “we’re not trying to target anyone individually. I want to make sure that I get to know all of the top researchers in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diplomatic approach masks what is fundamentally a zero-sum competition for a finite pool of top-tier superintelligence AI talent. The potential shift away from open-source development also signals a broader industry trend toward more proprietary approaches to AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion: A defining moment for Meta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s superintelligence initiative represents a re-imagining of the company’s future. After the costly metaverse experiment failed to deliver results, Zuckerberg is betting even bigger on AI, with investments that could exceed US$100 billion over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success or failure of Meta Superintelligence Labs will likely determine not just the company’s future but the trajectory of the broader AI industry. With some employees expecting “an exodus of AI talent who were not chosen to join Wang’s superintelligence team,” the stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Meta’s AI talent acquisition campaign will yield the breakthrough technologies Zuckerberg envisions remains to be seen.

After burning through US$46 billion on the metaverse with little to show for it, the Meta CEO is now doubling down with an even more ambitious wager: superintelligence AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, however, the stakes are higher, the competition more fierce, and the potential rewards more transformative than anything Meta has attempted before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With nine-figure compensation packages and infrastructure investments that dwarf even the metaverse spending spree, Zuckerberg’s superintelligence AI gamble represents Silicon Valley’s most expensive talent war – one that could either cement Meta’s position as a tech giant or become another cautionary tale of visionary ambition meeting harsh reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The birth of Meta Superintelligence Labs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formation of Meta Superintelligence Labs marks a shift for the social media giant. In an exclusive interview with &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;‘s TITV live-streaming programme, Zuckerberg told founder Jessica Lessin that “the most exciting thing this year is that we’re starting to see early glimpses of self-improvement with the models, which means that developing super intelligence is now in sight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision has driven the company to restructure its entire AI division, with the ambitious goal of delivering what Zuckerberg calls “personal super intelligence to everyone in the world.” The lab’s creation follows a period of internal struggles in Meta’s AI division, including management struggles, employee churn, and product releases that fell flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than incrementally improving existing systems, Zuckerberg has opted for a complete overhaul, bringing in external leadership and re-imagining the company’s approach to AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Are we witnessing the most expensive talent war in tech history?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to Meta’s superintelligence AI ambitions is a talent acquisition strategy that has sent shockwaves through the industry. Zuckerberg has embarked on a spending spree to create the new lab, offering as much as nine-figure pay packages to hire top researchers from companies like OpenAI, Google, Apple and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Information’s&lt;/em&gt; Lessin questioned reports of US$100-200 million compensation packages, Zuckerberg acknowledged the competitive nature of the market, stating that “a lot of the specifics that have been reported aren’t accurate by themselves. But it is a very hot market… there’s a small number of researchers, who are the best, who are in demand by all of the different labs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Meta AI talent acquisition strategy extends beyond financial incentives. Zuckerberg said having “basically the most compute per researcher is a strategic advantage, not just for doing the work, but for attracting the best people.” The approach reflects an understanding that in the superintelligence AI race, talent density matters more than team size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Alexandr Wang acquisition: A US$14.3b gamble&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centrepiece of Meta’s talent strategy was its acquisition of Scale AI leadership. In June, the company made a US$14.3 billion investment in the AI startup, founded and led by Wang. Under the deal, Meta took a 49% stake in the company, and Wang and a team of top Scale employees joined Meta in leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At just 28 years old, Alexandr Wang now serves as Meta’s chief AI officer, leading what the company has renamed “Meta Superintelligence Labs.” In the larger AI division, Wang has led a team of around a dozen newly-hired researchers, a handful of his deputies from Scale AI, and Nat Friedman, the former chief executive of GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration of Wang’s team as a re-imagining of how Meta approaches AI development. The group is working in an office space siloed from the rest of the company and next to Zuckerberg, highlighting the importance placed on the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A philosophical shift: From open source to closed development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant development emerging from Meta Superintelligence Labs is a potential abandonment of the company’s long-standing open-source philosophy. Last week, a small group of top members of the lab, including Wang, discussed abandoning the company’s most powerful open source AI model, called Behemoth, in favour of developing a closed model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a departure from Meta’s historical approach. For years, Meta has chosen to open source its AI models, making code public for other developers to build on. Meta executives have argued it is better for the technology to be built in public so that AI development will move faster and be accessible to more developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift reflects concerns about competitive positioning in the AI race. Meta had finished feeding data into its Behemoth model (training) but has delayed its release because of poor internal performance. The setback has prompted a serious reconsideration of the company’s approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure as a competitive advantage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond talent acquisition, Meta is making infrastructure investments to support its superintelligence ambitions. Zuckerberg revealed that the company is “building multiple, multi-gigawatt data centres” and pioneering new construction methods, including “weatherproof tents” to accelerate deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of these investments is staggering. Hyperion, one of Meta’s new data centres, “is going to scale up to five gigawatts over the coming years” and “the size of the site covers a significant portion of the footprint of Manhattan in terms of space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure spending is enabled by Meta’s strong financial position, with Zuckerberg noting that “we can basically do this all funded from the cash flow of the company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The personal superintelligence vision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes Meta’s approach from competitors is its focus on “personal superintelligence” rather than centralised AI systems. During his interview with &lt;em&gt;The Information’s&lt;/em&gt; Lessin, Zuckerberg explained that while other labs focus on “wanting to automate all of the economically productive work in society,” Meta’s vision centres on “what are the things that people care about in their own lives… relationships and culture and creativity and having fun and enjoying life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision extends to Meta’s hardware ambitions, particularly its AR glasses initiative. In the same TITV interview, Zuckerberg predicted that “if you don’t have AI glasses, you’re going to be at a cognitive disadvantage” and described future scenarios where AI companions could “observe what’s going on in your life and be able to follow up on things for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industry implications and competitive dynamics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of Meta’s superintelligence push extend beyond the company. Meta’s AI talent acquisition strategy has created salary inflation in the industry, forcing competitors to match or exceed Meta’s compensation levels to retain their researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about his interactions with competitors at Sun Valley, Zuckerberg acknowledged the competitive landscape, stating that “we’re not trying to target anyone individually. I want to make sure that I get to know all of the top researchers in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diplomatic approach masks what is fundamentally a zero-sum competition for a finite pool of top-tier superintelligence AI talent. The potential shift away from open-source development also signals a broader industry trend toward more proprietary approaches to AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion: A defining moment for Meta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s superintelligence initiative represents a re-imagining of the company’s future. After the costly metaverse experiment failed to deliver results, Zuckerberg is betting even bigger on AI, with investments that could exceed US$100 billion over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success or failure of Meta Superintelligence Labs will likely determine not just the company’s future but the trajectory of the broader AI industry.

&lt;p&gt;Delta has become the first airline to announce that it is using AI to boost profits by personalizing pricing through a pilot program that for months has caused customers to pay different prices for the same flights based on their data profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics have warned that this use of AI goes beyond airline practices that charge people who book flights ahead less than people who book flights at the last minute—and could ultimately mean the end of cheap flights across the board if other airlines follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an earnings call last week, Delta Air Lines President Glen William Hauenstein confirmed that seats on about 3 percent of domestic flights were sold using the AI pricing system over the past six months. By the end of the year, Delta's goal is to boost that to 20 percent of tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer Watchdog has warned that while so-called individualized pricing could theoretically be used to lower prices for Delta customers, without public reporting on how the pricing works, it's impossible to know if it's fair or possibly violating federal laws that prohibit charging different rates based on protected classes, like sex or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often when it's used, "the best deals were offered to the wealthiest customers—with the worst deals given to the poorest people, who are least likely to have other options," Fortune reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, Hauenstein told investors that Delta's goal is to eventually get rid of static pricing entirely, Fortune reported, likely motivated even more today based on reportedly "amazingly favorable" results the airline has seen so far. Other airlines may follow its lead, as Delta made it clear to investors that even though the feature is still in a "heavy testing phase," it's&amp;nbsp;working to propel revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We like what we see," Hauenstein told investors on the earnings call. "We like it a lot."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Slover, general counsel for a digital rights group called the Center for Democracy and Technology, warned last fall that tailoring prices based on a customer's "identity, preferences, and situation" could lead airlines to collude to spike prices. His post suggested that Delta may be motivated to leave customers in the dark on their AI models while picking their pockets. So far, Delta has not confirmed when it may release public records showing the pricing variance occurring from its pilot program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The very fact that Delta is saying that the early results of this intrusive pricing scheme 'show amazingly favorable results' says it all," Slover said in a statement provided to Ars. "They are increasing their profits, and those profits are coming from the consumers they are taking advantage of."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta has partnered with Fetcherr for the pilot. Fetcherr an Israeli company that "also counts Azul, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, and VivaAerobus as clients" and plans to expand into other travel industries once its tech becomes established in the airline industry, Fortune noted. Slover expects that for companies wooed with tech like Fetcherr's, the proposition will be "irresistible."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta declined Ars' request to comment, but a spokesperson told Fortune that the airline "has zero tolerance for discrimination. Our fares are publicly filed and based solely on trip-related factors like advance purchase and cabin class, and we maintain strict safeguards to ensure compliance with federal law."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Senator vows to block Delta’s AI pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Slover, companies like Delta could vary prices using data like a customer's web-browsing activity, prior purchases, searches for products, or their "income, assets, debts, and financial condition and history." Looking at past purchases could reveal how much they're willing to spend on comparable items, while social data could indicate if, for example, a flight is urgently needed. Any of these data points could "indicate the consumer is more susceptible to sales-pitch puffery or pressure," Slover suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Delta's AI pricing could increase competition in the airline industry, Slover expects that companies using such pricing schemes are "all too likely" to be incentivized "to skew in the direction of higher prices" because of the AI pricing's lack of transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Informed consumer choice is the engine that drives competition; because consumers won’t be as informed, and thus will have little or no agency in the supposed competitive benefits, they are more apt to be taken advantage of than to benefit," Slover said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta could face backlash as it rolls out individualized pricing over the next few years, Slover suggested, as some customers are "apt to react viscerally" to what privacy advocates term "surveillance pricing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company could also get pushback from officials, with the Federal Trade Commission already studying how individualized pricing like Delta's pilot could potentially violate the FTC Act or harm consumers. That could result in new rulemaking, Solver said, or possibly even legislation "to prohibit or rein it in."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some lawmakers are already scrutinizing pricing algorithms, Slover noted, with pricing practices of giants like Walmart and Amazon targeted in recent hearings held by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone wondering how to prevent personalized pricing that could make flights suddenly more expensive, Slover recommended using a virtual private network (VPN) when shopping as a short-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term, stronger privacy laws could gut such AI tools of the data needed to increase or lower prices, Slover said. Third-party intermediaries could also be used, he suggested, "restoring anonymity" to the shopping process by relying on third-party technology acting as a "purchasing agent." Ideally, those third parties would not be collecting data themselves, Slover said, recommending that nonprofits like Consumer Reports could be good candidates to offer that form of consumer protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one lawmaker, Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), has explicitly vowed to block Delta's AI plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Delta’s CEO just got caught bragging about using AI to find your pain point—meaning they’ll squeeze you for every penny," Gallego wrote on X. "This isn’t fair pricing or competitive pricing. It’s predatory pricing. I won’t let them get away with this."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta has become the first airline to announce that it is using AI to boost profits by personalizing pricing through a pilot program that for months has caused customers to pay different prices for the same flights based on their data profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics have warned that this use of AI goes beyond airline practices that charge people who book flights ahead less than people who book flights at the last minute—and could ultimately mean the end of cheap flights across the board if other airlines follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an earnings call last week, Delta Air Lines President Glen William Hauenstein confirmed that seats on about 3 percent of domestic flights were sold using the AI pricing system over the past six months. By the end of the year, Delta's goal is to boost that to 20 percent of tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer Watchdog has warned that while so-called individualized pricing could theoretically be used to lower prices for Delta customers, without public reporting on how the pricing works, it's impossible to know if it's fair or possibly violating federal laws that prohibit charging different rates based on protected classes, like sex or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often when it's used, "the best deals were offered to the wealthiest customers—with the worst deals given to the poorest people, who are least likely to have other options," Fortune reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, Hauenstein told investors that Delta's goal is to eventually get rid of static pricing entirely, Fortune reported, likely motivated even more today based on reportedly "amazingly favorable" results the airline has seen so far. Other airlines may follow its lead, as Delta made it clear to investors that even though the feature is still in a "heavy testing phase," it's&amp;nbsp;working to propel revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We like what we see," Hauenstein told investors on the earnings call. "We like it a lot."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Slover, general counsel for a digital rights group called the Center for Democracy and Technology, warned last fall that tailoring prices based on a customer's "identity, preferences, and situation" could lead airlines to collude to spike prices. His post suggested that Delta may be motivated to leave customers in the dark on their AI models while picking their pockets. So far, Delta has not confirmed when it may release public records showing the pricing variance occurring from its pilot program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The very fact that Delta is saying that the early results of this intrusive pricing scheme 'show amazingly favorable results' says it all," Slover said in a statement provided to Ars. "They are increasing their profits, and those profits are coming from the consumers they are taking advantage of."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta has partnered with Fetcherr for the pilot. Fetcherr an Israeli company that "also counts Azul, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, and VivaAerobus as clients" and plans to expand into other travel industries once its tech becomes established in the airline industry, Fortune noted. Slover expects that for companies wooed with tech like Fetcherr's, the proposition will be "irresistible."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta declined Ars' request to comment, but a spokesperson told Fortune that the airline "has zero tolerance for discrimination. Our fares are publicly filed and based solely on trip-related factors like advance purchase and cabin class, and we maintain strict safeguards to ensure compliance with federal law."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Senator vows to block Delta’s AI pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Slover, companies like Delta could vary prices using data like a customer's web-browsing activity, prior purchases, searches for products, or their "income, assets, debts, and financial condition and history." Looking at past purchases could reveal how much they're willing to spend on comparable items, while social data could indicate if, for example, a flight is urgently needed. Any of these data points could "indicate the consumer is more susceptible to sales-pitch puffery or pressure," Slover suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, generate editable presentations and slideshows, and run code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tool, called ChatGPT agent, combines several capabilities from OpenAI’s previous agentic tools, including Operator’s ability to click around on websites, as well as Deep Research’s ability to synthesize information from dozens of websites into a concise research report. OpenAI says users will be able to interact with the agent simply by prompting ChatGPT in natural language.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT agent is rolling out on Thursday to subscribers to OpenAI’s Pro, Plus, and Team plans. To activate the tool, users can select “agent mode” in ChatGPT’s dropdown menu of tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;ChatGPT can now do work for you using its own computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing ChatGPT agent—a unified agentic system combining Operator’s action-taking remote browser, deep research’s web synthesis, and ChatGPT’s conversational strengths. pic.twitter.com/7uN2Nc6nBQ&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) July 17, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch of ChatGPT agent represents OpenAI’s boldest attempt yet to turn ChatGPT into an agentic product that can take actions and offload tasks for users, rather than just answering questions. In recent years, Silicon Valley companies including OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have unveiled dozens of AI agents that have promised to do just that. However, these early version AI agents have proven to struggle with complex tasks, and they seem less compelling as products than the ultimate vision tech executives pitch around AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, OpenAI says ChatGPT agent is far more capable than its previous offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s new agent can access ChatGPT connectors, allowing users to connect apps like Gmail and GitHub so that the agent can find relevant information to your prompts. OpenAI says ChatGPT agent has access to a terminal, and it can use APIs to access certain apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI suggests that users can tap ChatGPT agent to “plan and buy ingredients to make Japanese breakfast for four,” as well as “analyze three competitors and create a slide deck.” These kinds of capabilities requires ChatGPT agent to parse through websites, plan a course of action, and use tools — much more complicated tasks than OpenAI has previously tried to tackle with agents.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The model underlying ChatGPT agent offers state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, according to OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says the ChatGPT agent model scores 41.6% on Humanity’s Last Exam (pass@1), a difficult test made up of thousands of questions across more than one hundred subjects. That’s roughly double what OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini scored on the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On FrontierMath, one of the hardest known math benchmarks, OpenAI says ChatGPT agent scores 27.4% when it has access to tools, such as a terminal for code execution. The previous state-of-the-art score comes from o4-mini, which scored just 6.3%.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI notes that it developed ChatGPT agent with safety in mind, largely because the product presents some newfound capabilities that could make it more dangerous in the hands of a bad actor. OpenAI has previously warned that agentic models could present more dangerous capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a safety report for ChatGPT agent, OpenAI says it’s designated the model as “high capability” in biological and chemical weapon domains, which is defined in OpenAI’s Preparedness Framework as a model with the ability to “amplify existing pathways to severe harm.” OpenAI notes that it does not have direct evidence of this, but it’s decided to take a precautionary approach and activate new safeguards to mitigate these risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new safeguards for ChatGPT agent include a monitor that works in real time as users interact with the product. OpenAI says it runs a classifier across every prompt entered into ChatGPT agent, determining whether the request is related to biology. If so, OpenAI runs ChatGPT agent’s response through a second monitor that determines whether the content could be used to evoke a biological threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also says it disabled ChatGPT’s memory feature for this agent to prevent misuse. In other parts of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s memory feature allows the chatbot to reference information from previous user chats. However, OpenAI says bad actors could use the feature in ChatGPT agent to exfiltrate sensitive data through prompt injection attacks. The company says it may revisit adding the feature in the future, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While ChatGPT agent sounds impressive, it remains to be seen how capable it truly is in the real world. Until now, agent technology has proven relatively brittle when interacting with the real world. That said, OpenAI says it’s developed a more capable model that’s able to deliver on the promise of AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was updated with more information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/openAI-spiral-rose.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI is launching a new general purpose AI agent in ChatGPT, which the company says can complete a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, generate editable presentations and slideshows, and run code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tool, called ChatGPT agent, combines several capabilities from OpenAI’s previous agentic tools, including Operator’s ability to click around on websites, as well as Deep Research’s ability to synthesize information from dozens of websites into a concise research report. OpenAI says users will be able to interact with the agent simply by prompting ChatGPT in natural language.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT agent is rolling out on Thursday to subscribers to OpenAI’s Pro, Plus, and Team plans. To activate the tool, users can select “agent mode” in ChatGPT’s dropdown menu of tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;ChatGPT can now do work for you using its own computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing ChatGPT agent—a unified agentic system combining Operator’s action-taking remote browser, deep research’s web synthesis, and ChatGPT’s conversational strengths. pic.twitter.com/7uN2Nc6nBQ&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) July 17, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch of ChatGPT agent represents OpenAI’s boldest attempt yet to turn ChatGPT into an agentic product that can take actions and offload tasks for users, rather than just answering questions. In recent years, Silicon Valley companies including OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have unveiled dozens of AI agents that have promised to do just that. However, these early version AI agents have proven to struggle with complex tasks, and they seem less compelling as products than the ultimate vision tech executives pitch around AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, OpenAI says ChatGPT agent is far more capable than its previous offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s new agent can access ChatGPT connectors, allowing users to connect apps like Gmail and GitHub so that the agent can find relevant information to your prompts. OpenAI says ChatGPT agent has access to a terminal, and it can use APIs to access certain apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI suggests that users can tap ChatGPT agent to “plan and buy ingredients to make Japanese breakfast for four,” as well as “analyze three competitors and create a slide deck.” These kinds of capabilities requires ChatGPT agent to parse through websites, plan a course of action, and use tools — much more complicated tasks than OpenAI has previously tried to tackle with agents.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The model underlying ChatGPT agent offers state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, according to OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says the ChatGPT agent model scores 41.6% on Humanity’s Last Exam (pass@1), a difficult test made up of thousands of questions across more than one hundred subjects. That’s roughly double what OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini scored on the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On FrontierMath, one of the hardest known math benchmarks, OpenAI says ChatGPT agent scores 27.4% when it has access to tools, such as a terminal for code execution. The previous state-of-the-art score comes from o4-mini, which scored just 6.3%.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI notes that it developed ChatGPT agent with safety in mind, largely because the product presents some newfound capabilities that could make it more dangerous in the hands of a bad actor. OpenAI has previously warned that agentic models could present more dangerous capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a safety report for ChatGPT agent, OpenAI says it’s designated the model as “high capability” in biological and chemical weapon domains, which is defined in OpenAI’s Preparedness Framework as a model with the ability to “amplify existing pathways to severe harm.” OpenAI notes that it does not have direct evidence of this, but it’s decided to take a precautionary approach and activate new safeguards to mitigate these risks.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K. has officially joined the premier league of global AI infrastructure — and it’s not starting small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Bristol Centre for Supercomputing (BriCS), leaders today unveiled Isambard-AI, the most powerful AI supercomputer ever built in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Secretary of State Peter Kyle was joined by leaders from across academia, industry and government, including Simon McIntosh-Smith, director of the Bristol Centre for Supercomputing, and Neil MacDonald, executive vice president and general manager  for Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s server business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as we press this switch to activate the UK’s most powerful supercomputer, we are embarking on Britain’s super future where AI contributes towards the delivery of better public services, greater public prosperity, deeper scientific discovery and stronger national security,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;” Kyle said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The numbers back up Kyle’s statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21 exaflops of AI performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5,448 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set to rank 11th worldwide on the latest TOP500 list of world’s fastest supercomputers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than 10x faster than the next-fastest supercomputer in the U.K. More computing power than all other U.K. supercomputers combined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranked fourth globally for energy efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isambard-AI gives U.K. researchers and businesses a once-in-a-generation leap in computing power. It’s a platform to accelerate breakthroughs in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI-driven drug discovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced climate modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Materials science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large language models (LLMs) tuned to U.K. languages and laws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by £225 million in government investment and built with NVIDIA, HPE, the University of Bristol and others, Isambard-AI signals a clear ambition: to lead in AI, the U.K. must lead in compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;A Turning Point for UK Science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel — the 19th-century engineer who reshaped Britain with railways, bridges and ships — Isambard-AI brings that same scale of ambition to AI research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like Brunel’s projects during his era, it moves fast. Having gone from conception to deployment in just under two years, including the construction of the modular data center in 48 hours, the supercomputer is already running live projects aligned with national priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early flagship projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nightingale AI:&lt;/b&gt; A sovereign, multimodal health foundation model trained on National Health Service (NHS) data to support earlier diagnoses and personalized care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;BritLLM&lt;/b&gt;: A U.K.-developed LLM project supporting British languages like Welsh, alongside English, to promote inclusivity and better public service delivery in healthcare, education and public services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;UCL Cancer Screening AI&lt;/b&gt;: Developing the first scalable AI system for prostate cancer detection via MRI, aiming for faster diagnoses and tailored treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;EIMCRYSTAL (University of Liverpool)&lt;/b&gt;: Using AI to search 68 million chemical combinations to discover greener, more sustainable industrial materials — reducing reliance on rare or toxic inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;EgoAI (University of Bristol):&lt;/b&gt; Using AI to analyze recordings from wearable cameras and other smart devices to help people perform tasks better at home. This holds immense promise for assisting dementia patients in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Built Fast, Built Smart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you build a supercomputer in half the usual time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We treated the project like a high-performance processor,” said Simon McIntosh-Smith, director at BriCS. “We executed everything in parallel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to this speed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallelized project management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early procurement of critical hardware, particularly GPUs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefabricated modular data halls shipped in and assembled in days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relentless optimization of delivery timelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground broke in June 2024. By June 2025, the full 5-megawatt system was live: built, tested and running at a global scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranked fourth globally on the Green500 list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powered by NVIDIA GH200 Superchips, among the most efficient chips available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct liquid-cooling architecture from HPE packs 440 GPUs per cabinet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid cooling towers enable &amp;gt;90% dry, waterless operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entirely powered by zero-carbon electricity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineered with the potential to recycle waste heat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall power usage effectiveness below 1.1, among the best ever achieved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K. has officially joined the premier league of global AI infrastructure — and it’s not starting small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Bristol Centre for Supercomputing (BriCS), leaders today unveiled Isambard-AI, the most powerful AI supercomputer ever built in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Secretary of State Peter Kyle was joined by leaders from across academia, industry and government, including Simon McIntosh-Smith, director of the Bristol Centre for Supercomputing, and Neil MacDonald, executive vice president and general manager  for Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s server business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as we press this switch to activate the UK’s most powerful supercomputer, we are embarking on Britain’s super future where AI contributes towards the delivery of better public services, greater public prosperity, deeper scientific discovery and stronger national security,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;” Kyle said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The numbers back up Kyle’s statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21 exaflops of AI performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5,448 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set to rank 11th worldwide on the latest TOP500 list of world’s fastest supercomputers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than 10x faster than the next-fastest supercomputer in the U.K. More computing power than all other U.K. supercomputers combined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranked fourth globally for energy efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isambard-AI gives U.K. researchers and businesses a once-in-a-generation leap in computing power. It’s a platform to accelerate breakthroughs in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI-driven drug discovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced climate modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Materials science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large language models (LLMs) tuned to U.K. languages and laws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by £225 million in government investment and built with NVIDIA, HPE, the University of Bristol and others, Isambard-AI signals a clear ambition: to lead in AI, the U.K. must lead in compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;A Turning Point for UK Science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel — the 19th-century engineer who reshaped Britain with railways, bridges and ships — Isambard-AI brings that same scale of ambition to AI research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like Brunel’s projects during his era, it moves fast. Having gone from conception to deployment in just under two years, including the construction of the modular data center in 48 hours, the supercomputer is already running live projects aligned with national priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early flagship projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nightingale AI:&lt;/b&gt; A sovereign, multimodal health foundation model trained on National Health Service (NHS) data to support earlier diagnoses and personalized care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;BritLLM&lt;/b&gt;: A U.K.-developed LLM project supporting British languages like Welsh, alongside English, to promote inclusivity and better public service delivery in healthcare, education and public services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;UCL Cancer Screening AI&lt;/b&gt;: Developing the first scalable AI system for prostate cancer detection via MRI, aiming for faster diagnoses and tailored treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;EIMCRYSTAL (University of Liverpool)&lt;/b&gt;: Using AI to search 68 million chemical combinations to discover greener, more sustainable industrial materials — reducing reliance on rare or toxic inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;EgoAI (University of Bristol):&lt;/b&gt; Using AI to analyze recordings from wearable cameras and other smart devices to help people perform tasks better at home. This holds immense promise for assisting dementia patients in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Built Fast, Built Smart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you build a supercomputer in half the usual time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We treated the project like a high-performance processor,” said Simon McIntosh-Smith, director at BriCS. “We executed everything in parallel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to this speed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallelized project management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early procurement of critical hardware, particularly GPUs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefabricated modular data halls shipped in and assembled in days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relentless optimization of delivery timelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground broke in June 2024. By June 2025, the full 5-megawatt system was live: built, tested and running at a global scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;World-Class Efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isambard-AI is not just fast — it’s green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranked fourth globally on the Green500 list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powered by NVIDIA GH200 Superchips, among the most efficient chips available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct liquid-cooling architecture from HPE packs 440 GPUs per cabinet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid cooling towers enable &amp;gt;90% dry, waterless operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entirely powered by zero-carbon electricity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineered with the potential to recycle waste heat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall power usage effectiveness below 1.1, among the best ever achieved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s a USB stick, onto which he has loaded a couple of his favorite open-weight LLMs—models that have been shared publicly by their creators and that can, in principle, be downloaded and run with local hardware. If human civilization should ever collapse, Willison plans to use all the knowledge encoded in their billions of parameters for help. “It’s like having a weird, condensed, faulty version of Wikipedia, so I can help reboot society with the help of my little USB stick,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But you don’t need to be planning for the end of the world to want to run an LLM on your own device. Willison, who writes a popular blog about local LLMs and software development, has plenty of compatriots: r/LocalLLaMA, a subreddit devoted to running LLMs on your own hardware, has half a million members.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For people who are concerned about privacy, want to break free from the control of the big LLM companies, or just enjoy tinkering, local models offer a compelling alternative to ChatGPT and its web-based peers.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The local LLM world used to have a high barrier to entry: In the early days, it was impossible to run anything useful without investing in pricey GPUs. But researchers have had so much success in shrinking down and speeding up models that anyone with a laptop, or even a smartphone, can now get in on the action. “A couple of years ago, I’d have said personal computers are not powerful enough to run the good models. You need a $50,000 server rack to run them,” Willison says. “And I kept on being proved wrong time and time again.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might want to download your own LLM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Getting into local models takes a bit more effort than, say, navigating to ChatGPT’s online interface. But the very accessibility of a tool like ChatGPT comes with a cost. “It’s the classic adage: If something’s free, you’re the product,” says Elizabeth Seger, the director of digital policy at Demos, a London-based think tank.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;OpenAI, which offers both paid and free tiers, trains its models on users’ chats by default. It’s not too difficult to opt out of this training, and it also used to be possible to remove your chat data from OpenAI’s systems entirely, until a recent legal decision in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI required the company to maintain all user conversations with ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Google, which has access to a wealth of data about its users, also trains its models on both free and paid users’ interactions with Gemini, and the only way to opt out of that training is to set your chat history to delete automatically—which means that you also lose access to your previous conversations. In general, Anthropic does not train its models using user conversations, but it will train on conversations that have been “flagged for Trust &amp;amp; Safety review.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Training may present particular privacy risks because of the ways that models internalize, and often recapitulate, their training data. Many people trust LLMs with deeply personal conversations—but if models are trained on that data, those conversations might not be nearly as private as users think, according to some experts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Some of your personal stories may be cooked into some of the models, and eventually be spit out in bits and bytes somewhere to other people,” says Giada Pistilli, principal ethicist at the company Hugging Face, which runs a huge library of freely downloadable LLMs and other AI resources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Pistilli, opting for local models as opposed to online chatbots has implications beyond privacy. “Technology means power,” she says. “And so who[ever] owns the technology also owns the power.” States, organizations, and even individuals might be motivated to disrupt the concentration of AI power in the hands of just a few companies by running their own local models.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Breaking away from the big AI companies also means having more control over your LLM experience. Online LLMs are constantly shifting under users’ feet: Back in April, ChatGPT suddenly started sucking up to users far more than it had previously, and just last week Grok started calling itself MechaHitler on X.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Providers tweak their models with little warning, and while those tweaks might sometimes improve model performance, they can also cause undesirable behaviors. Local LLMs may have their quirks, but at least they are consistent. The only person who can change your local model is you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, any model that can fit on a personal computer is going to be less powerful than the premier online offerings from the major AI companies. But there’s a benefit to working with weaker models—they can inoculate you against the more pernicious limitations of their larger peers. Small models may, for example, hallucinate more frequently and more obviously than Claude, GPT, and Gemini, and seeing those hallucinations can help you build up an awareness of how and when the larger models might also lie.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“Running local models is actually a really good exercise for developing that broader intuition for what these things can do,” Willison says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Local LLMs aren’t just for proficient coders. If you’re comfortable using your computer’s command-line interface, which allows you to browse files and run apps using text prompts, Ollama is a great option. Once you’ve installed the software, you can download and run any of the hundreds of models they offer with a single command.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to touch anything that even looks like code, you might opt for LM Studio, a user-friendly app that takes a lot of the guesswork out of running local LLMs. You can browse models from Hugging Face from right within the app, which provides plenty of information to help you make the right choice. Some popular and widely used models are tagged as “Staff Picks,” and every model is labeled according to whether it can be run entirely on your machine’s speedy GPU, needs to be shared between your GPU and slower CPU, or is too big to fit onto your device at all. Once you’ve chosen a model, you can download it, load it up, and start interacting with it using the app’s chat interface.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As you experiment with different models, you’ll start to get a feel for what your machine can handle. According to Willison, every billion model parameters require about one GB of RAM to run, and I found that approximation to be accurate: My own 16 GB laptop managed to run Alibaba’s Qwen3 14B as long as I quit almost every other app. If you run into issues with speed or usability, you can always go smaller—I got reasonable responses from Qwen3 8B as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you go really small, you can even run models on your cell phone. My beat-up iPhone 12 was able to run Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B using an app called LLM Farm. It’s not a particularly good model—it very quickly goes off into bizarre tangents and hallucinates constantly—but trying to coax something so chaotic toward usability can be entertaining. If I’m ever on a plane sans Wi-Fi and desperate for a probably false answer to a trivia question, I now know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the models that I was able to run on my laptop were effective enough that I can imagine using them in my journalistic work. And while I don’t think I’ll depend on phone-based models for anything anytime soon, I really did enjoy playing around with them. “I think most people probably don’t need to do this, and that’s fine,” Willison says. “But for the people who want to do this, it’s so much fun.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/llm-install2.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s How To series helps you get things done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Simon Willison has a plan for the end of the world.

 &lt;p&gt;“Running local models is actually a really good exercise for developing that broader intuition for what these things can do,” Willison says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Local LLMs aren’t just for proficient coders. If you’re comfortable using your computer’s command-line interface, which allows you to browse files and run apps using text prompts, Ollama is a great option. Once you’ve installed the software, you can download and run any of the hundreds of models they offer with a single command.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to touch anything that even looks like code, you might opt for LM Studio, a user-friendly app that takes a lot of the guesswork out of running local LLMs. You can browse models from Hugging Face from right within the app, which provides plenty of information to help you make the right choice. Some popular and widely used models are tagged as “Staff Picks,” and every model is labeled according to whether it can be run entirely on your machine’s speedy GPU, needs to be shared between your GPU and slower CPU, or is too big to fit onto your device at all. Once you’ve chosen a model, you can download it, load it up, and start interacting with it using the app’s chat interface.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As you experiment with different models, you’ll start to get a feel for what your machine can handle. According to Willison, every billion model parameters require about one GB of RAM to run, and I found that approximation to be accurate: My own 16 GB laptop managed to run Alibaba’s Qwen3 14B as long as I quit almost every other app. If you run into issues with speed or usability, you can always go smaller—I got reasonable responses from Qwen3 8B as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you go really small, you can even run models on your cell phone. My beat-up iPhone 12 was able to run Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B using an app called LLM Farm. It’s not a particularly good model—it very quickly goes off into bizarre tangents and hallucinates constantly—but trying to coax something so chaotic toward usability can be entertaining. If I’m ever on a plane sans Wi-Fi and desperate for a probably false answer to a trivia question, I now know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the models that I was able to run on my laptop were effective enough that I can imagine using them in my journalistic work. And while I don’t think I’ll depend on phone-based models for anything anytime soon, I really did enjoy playing around with them. “I think most people probably don’t need to do this, and that’s fine,” Willison says. “But for the people who want to do this, it’s so much fun.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/17/1120391/how-to-run-an-llm-on-your-laptop/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 17:01:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Google hides secret message in name list of 3,295 AI researchers (AI – Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/why-it-takes-3295-people-to-write-one-google-ai-paper/</link><description>&lt;article class="double-column h-entry post-2106424 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-ai category-information-technology tag-academic-research tag-ai tag-ai-research tag-david-ha tag-gemini tag-gemini-2-5 tag-google-2 tag-google-deepmind tag-hardmaru tag-large-language-models tag-machine-learning tag-scientific-publishing"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;How many Google AI researchers does it take to screw in a lightbulb? A recent research paper detailing the technical core behind Google's Gemini AI assistant may suggest an answer, listing an eye-popping 3,295 authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a number that recently caught the attention of machine learning researcher David Ha (known as "hardmaru" online), who revealed on X that the first 43 names also contain a hidden message. "There’s a secret code if you observe the authors’ first initials in the order of authorship," Ha wrote, relaying the Easter egg: "GEMINI MODELS CAN THINK AND GET BACK TO YOU IN A FLASH."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper, titled "Gemini 2.5: Pushing the Frontier with Advanced Reasoning, Multimodality, Long Context, and Next Generation Agentic Capabilities," describes Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash AI models, which were released in March. These large language models, which power Google's chatbot AI assistant, feature simulated reasoning capabilities that produce a string of "thinking out loud" text before generating responses in an attempt to help them solve more difficult problems. That explains "think" and "flash" in the hidden text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But clever Easter egg aside, the sheer scale of authorship tells its own story about modern AI development. Just seeing the massive list made us wonder: Is 3,295 authors unprecedented? Why so many?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not the biggest, but still massive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 3,295 authors represents an enormous collaborative effort within Google, it doesn't break the record for academic authorship. According to Guinness World Records, a 2021 paper by the COVIDSurg and GlobalSurg Collaboratives holds that distinction, with 15,025 authors from 116 countries. In physics, a 2015 paper from CERN's Large Hadron Collider teams featured 5,154 authors across 33 pages—with 24 pages devoted solely to listing names and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CERN paper provided the most precise estimate of the Higgs boson mass at the time and represented a collaboration between two massive detector teams. Similarly large author lists have become common in particle physics, where experiments require contributions from thousands of scientists, engineers, and support staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Gemini development at Google DeepMind, building a family of AI models requires experience spanning multiple disciplines. It involves not just machine learning researchers but also software engineers building infrastructure, hardware specialists optimizing for specific processors, ethicists evaluating safety implications, product managers coordinating efforts, and domain experts ensuring the models work across different applications and languages.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;And complexity in AI model development has ballooned over a short period. Google's initial Gemini paper from 2023 included a "mere" 1,350 authors. That's a 144 percent increase in authorship headcount in under two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A collaborative future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that being said, we wonder: Does the Gemini 2.5 paper show how modern AI research has become a massive team sport—one where traditional notions of authorship struggle to capture the collaborative reality of pushing the tech frontier, or is Google simply being unusually generous in granting credit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the astronomical author count trend in AI papers does not necessarily extend beyond Google. At competitor OpenAI, the company's o1 System Card lists 260 authors, and its GPT-4o System Card lists 417 authors. Numerous, no doubt, but not numbering in the thousands. The difference may come down to OpenAI being a smaller company, but also to management decisions about who gets their name on the list. Apparently, Google has adopted very inclusive authorship criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many authors on one paper, one might wonder if listing them all might muddy some part of the academic process. For example, should papers include everyone involved, even the guy who mops the floor in the server room? Such large author lists can blur the distinction between core contributors and peripheral participants, making it difficult to assess individual contributions. Additionally, with 3,295 authors who might naturally cite the paper in their future work, there's a risk of inflating citation counts in ways that may not accurately reflect the paper's scientific impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one science blogger noted about large physics collaborations, "Papers simply do not have 5000 'authors.' In fact, I would bet that no more than a handful of the 'authors' listed on the record-breaking paper have even read the article, never mind written any of it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not saying that all of those 3,295 people don't deserve credit, but it's a large and unwieldy number to chew. Meanwhile, AI projects continue to expand in complexity. In fact, if we keep seeing 144 percent increases in authorship numbers every two years, by 2040, Google's AI papers may have over 2.65 million authors. We'll need AI models just to read the author list.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;And complexity in AI model development has ballooned over a short period. Google's initial Gemini paper from 2023 included a "mere" 1,350 authors. That's a 144 percent increase in authorship headcount in under two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A collaborative future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that being said, we wonder: Does the Gemini 2.5 paper show how modern AI research has become a massive team sport—one where traditional notions of authorship struggle to capture the collaborative reality of pushing the tech frontier, or is Google simply being unusually generous in granting credit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the astronomical author count trend in AI papers does not necessarily extend beyond Google. At competitor OpenAI, the company's o1 System Card lists 260 authors, and its GPT-4o System Card lists 417 authors. Numerous, no doubt, but not numbering in the thousands. The difference may come down to OpenAI being a smaller company, but also to management decisions about who gets their name on the list. Apparently, Google has adopted very inclusive authorship criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many authors on one paper, one might wonder if listing them all might muddy some part of the academic process. For example, should papers include everyone involved, even the guy who mops the floor in the server room? Such large author lists can blur the distinction between core contributors and peripheral participants, making it difficult to assess individual contributions. Additionally, with 3,295 authors who might naturally cite the paper in their future work, there's a risk of inflating citation counts in ways that may not accurately reflect the paper's scientific impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one science blogger noted about large physics collaborations, "Papers simply do not have 5000 'authors.' In fact, I would bet that no more than a handful of the 'authors' listed on the record-breaking paper have even read the article, never mind written any of it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not saying that all of those 3,295 people don't deserve credit, but it's a large and unwieldy number to chew. Meanwhile, AI projects continue to expand in complexity. In fact, if we keep seeing 144 percent increases in authorship numbers every two years, by 2040, Google's AI papers may have over 2.65 million authors. We'll need AI models just to read the author list.&lt;/p&gt;

ChatGPT now gets its &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; PC? And it can use that PC to log into your, the human user’s, accounts and download or send stuff for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s correct, at least in a virtual sense, according to OpenAI.

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The model can choose to open a page using the text browser or visual browser, download a file from the web, manipulate it by running a command in the terminal, and then view the output back in the visual browser. The model adapts its approach to carry out tasks with speed, accuracy, and eﬃciency.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-use-chatgpt-agent"&gt;How to use ChatGPT agent&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users can engage the agent by clicking on the ‘Tools’ button in the ChatGPT prompt entry box, opening the dropdown menu, and selecting ‘agent mode’ from the available options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014403" height="335" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-17-at-1.51.54%E2%80%AFPM-2.png" width="621" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, when it’s turned on describe a task in plain language, and the agent can carry it out across web and local app environments, combining reasoning with actions that previously only a human user could perform on their own machine, manually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT agent can connect to apps like your personal or business Gmail and GitHub, so it can pull in useful information — emails or code — from your accounts to help with tasks you ask it to do. It can connect to third-party application programming interfaces (API) to pull information and use connected applications and services through them, as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a website needs you to log in, you can do that securely through a special browser view, which lets the agent dig deeper and handle more personalized tasks, like checking your inbox or filling out forms on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-going-where-operator-could-not-offline"&gt;Going where Operator could not — offline&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new ChatGPT agent builds upon and expands from the “Operator” agent OpenAI released in January 2025, which allowed ChatGPT to browse the web and fill out forms, place orders, and do other web-based tasks in a private “headless browser,” that is, a cloud-based custom web browser that OpenAI itself maintained and offered for each Operator session. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Operator was limited only to interacting with websites and web-based applications — not programs that could also run locally on a PC, such as spreadsheet tabulators and slide deck presentation making software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new ChatGPT agent can browse websites, interact with online forms, run code, analyze data, and deliver finished outputs — such as editable presentations or spreadsheets — based entirely on user instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unveiling comes on the heels of a report published days ago by independent subscription tech industry website &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; suggesting that OpenAI would upgrade ChatGPT to be a more direct competitor to its own investor Microsoft’s Office software applications (e.g. Excel, Word, PowerPoint, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-merging-operator-and-deep-research-into-one-agent"&gt;Merging Operator and Deep Research into one agent&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, OpenAI positions ChatGPT agent as a merging of two of its prior agents — Operator and Deep Research, the latter introduced in February 2025, which exhaustively searches the web through its own headless text-only browser to find and compile information into lengthy and in-depth reports (hence the name). As OpenAI writes in a blog post:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Operator couldn’t dive deep into analysis or write detailed reports, and deep research couldn’t interact with websites to refine results or access content requiring user authentication. In fact, we saw that many queries users attempted with Operator were actually better suited for deep research, so we brought the best of both together.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The previous Operator tool will be phased out, but users can still access Deep Research via the dropdown in the ChatGPT interface.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Whether using a visual browser to interact with a website or a terminal to run Python code, the agent moves seamlessly between tools within a single session.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It supports a broad range of use cases, from analyzing competitors and generating reports to planning trips, summarizing emails, or booking appointments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users can interrupt, redirect, or pause a task at any time, with the agent picking up right where it left off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-availability-and-access"&gt;Availability and access&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting today, subscribers to ChatGPT’s $200-per-month “Pro” tier will have full access to ChatGPT agent, with a monthly quota of 400 messages. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) and Team ($30 per month) will gain access over the next few days, with 40 messages per month. Additional usage is available through credit-based options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI said in a release shared with VentureBeat under embargo that its ChatGPT Enterprise and Education subscribers will gain access to the feature the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the feature is not yet available in Europe or Switzerland, no doubt disappointing residents there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-built-with-safety-and-control-at-the-forefront"&gt;Built with safety and control at the forefront&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given that the agent can now take actions on behalf of users — including on logged-in websites or with connected apps — OpenAI has introduced extensive safety measures. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These include user confirmations before taking action, active supervision for sensitive tasks, and technical safeguards to limit unintended behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Key protections include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmation prompts&lt;/strong&gt; before actions like submitting forms or sending emails&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch Mode&lt;/strong&gt;, which pauses execution when a user becomes inactive&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refusal of high-risk tasks&lt;/strong&gt;, such as financial transfers or privacy violations&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No memory retention&lt;/strong&gt; during agent sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-risk-domain-classification"&gt;High-risk domain classification&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In line with its Preparedness Framework, OpenAI is treating ChatGPT agent as a &lt;strong&gt;High capability&lt;/strong&gt; system in the biological and chemical domains. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there is no direct evidence of misuse, the company is activating its strongest safety safeguards out of caution. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These include enhanced refusal training, red teaming by biosafety experts, and improved detection systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recall that Anthropic‘s recent information released about its new Claude Opus 4, and other surveys of advanced AI models, have shown that when given access to external tools and applications such as email, they can in some cases take actions they believe to be moral and ethical but that may compromise the user, such as emailing government agencies or journalists of suspected wrongdoing on the part of the user. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model thinks it is acting like a “whistleblower” but in fact, may compromise user privacy, security, and proprietary information and alert authorities to wrongdoing where there is none, or where it is dubious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strong-performance-on-real-world-tasks"&gt;Strong performance on real-world tasks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT agent isn’t just more capable in theory—it has delivered strong results across a number of benchmarks designed to simulate real-world knowledge work. It set a new high score on Humanity’s Last Exam with a 44.4 using parallel rollout methods, and achieved 27.4% on the difficult FrontierMath benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014394" height="449" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chart.png" width="490" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On SpreadsheetBench, it scored 45.5%—more than doubling Copilot in Excel’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-current-limitations-and-next-steps"&gt;Current limitations and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some features, like slideshow generation, are still in beta and may feel basic in formatting or differ slightly between in-app previews and exported files. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is actively training the next iteration of this feature to improve polish and layout. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The launch of ChatGPT agent signals a shift in how users interact with AI—from asking questions to assigning complete tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With its ability to reason, act, and produce deliverables, OpenAI is betting that users increasingly want AI not just to assist them, but to work for them. While the company emphasizes that the agent is still evolving, it sees this launch as the foundation for a more interactive, action-oriented future for AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT agent isn’t just more capable in theory—it has delivered strong results across a number of benchmarks designed to simulate real-world knowledge work. It set a new high score on Humanity’s Last Exam with a 44.4 using parallel rollout methods, and achieved 27.4% on the difficult FrontierMath benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On SpreadsheetBench, it scored 45.5%—more than doubling Copilot in Excel’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some features, like slideshow generation, are still in beta and may feel basic in formatting or differ slightly between in-app previews and exported files. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is actively training the next iteration of this feature to improve polish and layout. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The launch of ChatGPT agent signals a shift in how users interact with AI—from asking questions to assigning complete tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With its ability to reason, act, and produce deliverables, OpenAI is betting that users increasingly want AI not just to assist them, but to work for them. While the company emphasizes that the agent is still evolving, it sees this launch as the foundation for a more interactive, action-oriented future for AI.&lt;/p&gt;
