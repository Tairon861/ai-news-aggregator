Campaigns span formats, devices, data partnerships, and regulatory constraints, which make manual optimisation problematic. PubMatic is positioning AgenticOS as a response to such pressure, presenting it as an ‘operating system’ that allows multiple AI agents to transact and optimise campaigns inside human-defined objectives, and with what company-defined guardrails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AgenticOS acts across infrastructure and applications to coordinate decisions. This aligns with current research trends showing that agentic systems outperform single-model automation in contexts where campaign tasks trade-off cost, performance, and risk analysis that are inherent in media buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cost-reduction-through-operational-compression"&gt;Cost reduction through operational compression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For medium to large organisations, marketing cost rises are driven by operational overhead rather than media prices. PubMatic reports early tests where agent-led campaigns reduced setup time by 87% and issue resolution by 70%. Even allowing for bias, these figures are consistent with studies of AI-assisted workflow automation in enterprise marketing. Typically, these find 30–50% reductions in manual labour in planning and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The near-term opportunity for budget holders is not headcount reduction necessarily, but capacity gains. Agentic systems absorb decision load—bid adjustments, pacing changes, and inventory discovery. This lets teams run more campaigns concurrently or redirect effort to activities like experimentation and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="decision-quality-at-scale"&gt;Decision quality at scale&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AgenticOS’s claim is that it enables continuous decision-making without fragmentation, significant as most marketing inefficiency arises from delayed or inconsistent execution, not poor strategy. Human teams operate in reporting cycles, while agentic systems operate in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research into real-time optimisation suggests marginal gains at auction level can compound with large spends. At enterprise level, even low single-digit percentage improvements in effective CPM or conversion efficiency translate can have budgetary impact. Agentic AI does not eliminate the need for human judgement, but changes where and when judgement is made. Instead of reactive troubleshooting, teams define objectives, constraints, and success goal definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="governance-control-and-brand-safety"&gt;Governance, control, and brand safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A persistent concern among senior marketers is loss of control to agentic processes. PubMatic states AgenticOS works from advertisers’ objectives, brand-safety rules, and creative parameters, with agents operating inside those boundaries. This reflects a wider industry consensus that agentic AI adoption will only scale where governance is embedded at system level rather than bolted on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decision-makers, the practical lesson is to invest early in codifying marketing intent, detailing performance hierarchies, set brand constraints, and escalation thresholds. Organisations that treat agentic AI as a strategic execution layer, rather than a black box, are likely to realise benefits faster and with lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="predictions-for-the-next-24-months"&gt;Predictions for the next 24 months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence from adjacent enterprise functions such as supply chain, finance, and customer support suggest three likely developments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, agentic AI will become a standard execution layer in programmatic advertising, with a shift from automation to high-quality intent modelling and agent coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, marketing operating models will flatten, with smaller teams managing large, more complex portfolios. Senior marketers will spending more time on scenario planning and less on day-to-day campaign mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, vendors offering system-level agentic platforms (not isolated point solutions) will be able to deliver ROI, as cost savings and performance gains compound across the workflow rather than at isolated points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="practical-advice-for-marketing-leaders"&gt;Practical advice for marketing leaders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing decision-makers could regard AgenticOS and similar platforms as infrastructure investment.

This cross-economy sandbox is designed to accelerate the deployment of autonomous technologies by granting “time-limited regulatory exemptions” to firms. The government’s position is that many regulations are outdated, having been designed before autonomous software existed, often assuming that decisions are made by people rather than machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers believe that if the UK can move faster than its global competitors, it can secure a defining economic advantage, with a potential&amp;nbsp; £140 billion boost to national output by 2030. Their preliminary analysis specifically flags legal services as a sector where removing “unnecessary legal barriers” could generate billions in value over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the legal profession – supposedly the beneficiary of this deregulation – isn’t asking for exemptions. In its formal response, the Law Society made clear that the existing framework is robust enough. The friction lies not in the rules themselves, but in the lack of certainty surrounding them. While two-thirds of lawyers already use AI tools, confusion remains the primary brake on deeper integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Headshot of Ian Jeffery, CEO of The Law Society." class="wp-image-111485" height="800" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image.jpeg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian Jeffery, CEO of The Law Society, said: “AI innovation is vital for the legal sector and already has great momentum. The existing legal regulatory framework supports progress. The main challenges don’t stem from regulatory burdens, but rather from uncertainty, cost, data and skills associated with AI adoption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than a regulatory overhaul, the profession is asking for a practical roadmap. Firms are currently navigating a grey area regarding liability and data protection. Solicitors need definitive answers on whether client data must be anonymised before it is fed into AI platforms, and they require standardised protocols for data security and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions get thornier when errors occur. If an AI tool generates harmful legal advice, it is currently unclear where the buck stops (i.e. with the solicitor, the firm, the developer, or the insurer.) There is also ambiguity about supervision requirements, specifically whether a human lawyer must oversee every instance of AI deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such concerns are particularly acute for “reserved legal activities” like court representation, conveyancing, and probate, where practitioners need to know if using automated assistance puts them in breach of their professional duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-laws-must-retain-safeguards"&gt;AI laws must retain safeguards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has tried to reassure the public that the sandbox will have “red lines” to protect fundamental rights and safety. However, The Law Society remains wary of any move that might dilute consumer protection in the name of speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Technological progress in the legal sector should not expose clients or consumers to unregulated risks,” Jeffery stated. “Current regulation of the profession reflects the safeguards that Parliament deemed vital to protect clients and the public. It ensures trust in the English and Welsh legal system worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body is willing to collaborate on a “legal services sandbox,” but only if it upholds professional standards rather than bypassing them. For The Law Society, the priority is maintaining the integrity of the justice system in the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Law Society strongly supports innovation provided it remains aligned with professional integrity and operates in a solid regulatory environment,” Jeffery explained. “The government must work with legal regulators and bodies to ensure adherence to the sector’s professional standards.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The magnet is the first of 18 that, when the reactor is complete, will create a doughnut-like shape that will produce a powerful magnetic field to confine and compress superheated plasma. If all goes well, that plasma will release more energy than it takes to heat and compress it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After decades of promise and delay, fusion power appears to be just around the corner — CFS and its competitors are locked in a race to deliver the first electrons to the grid sometime in the early 2030s. If it pans out, fusion power could unlock nearly limitless clean energy in a package that resembles a traditional power plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Key components of Sparc’s magnets have been completed, and the company expects to install all 18 by the end of the summer, said Bob Mumgaard, CFS’ co-founder and CEO. “It’ll go bang, bang, bang throughout the first half of this year as we put together this revolutionary technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An engineer stands inside a superconducting magnet." class="wp-image-3080253" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Each magnet weighs 24 tons and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Commonwealth Fusion Systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When installed, the D-shaped magnets will sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was set in place last March. The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It’s the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia’s Omniverse libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That won’t be CFS’ first simulation — the company has already been running numerous simulations to predict the performance of various parts of the reactor — but the existing efforts provide results in isolation, Mumgaard said. With the digital twin, he said, “these are no longer isolated simulations that are just used for design. They’ll be alongside the physical thing the whole way through, and we’ll be constantly comparing them to each other.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An illustration shows a digital twin of the Sparc fusion reactor" class="wp-image-3080254" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;CFS is working with Nvidia and Siemens to produce a digital twin of the Sparc fusion reactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Commonwealth Fusion Systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Building Sparc has been a costly endeavor. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an $863 million Series B2 round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. The company’s first commercial-scale power plant, Arc, will be the first of its kind. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s&amp;nbsp;coverage of the annual CES conference here.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said on Tuesday at CES 2026 that it had installed the first magnet in its Sparc fusion reactor, the demonstration device that it hopes to turn on next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Key components of Sparc’s magnets have been completed, and the company expects to install all 18 by the end of the summer, said Bob Mumgaard, CFS’ co-founder and CEO. “It’ll go bang, bang, bang throughout the first half of this year as we put together this revolutionary technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An engineer stands inside a superconducting magnet." class="wp-image-3080253" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Each magnet weighs 24 tons and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Commonwealth Fusion Systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When installed, the D-shaped magnets will sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was set in place last March. The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It’s the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia’s Omniverse libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That won’t be CFS’ first simulation — the company has already been running numerous simulations to predict the performance of various parts of the reactor — but the existing efforts provide results in isolation, Mumgaard said. With the digital twin, he said, “these are no longer isolated simulations that are just used for design. They’ll be alongside the physical thing the whole way through, and we’ll be constantly comparing them to each other.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An illustration shows a digital twin of the Sparc fusion reactor" class="wp-image-3080254" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;CFS is working with Nvidia and Siemens to produce a digital twin of the Sparc fusion reactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Commonwealth Fusion Systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Building Sparc has been a costly endeavor. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an $863 million Series B2 round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. The company’s first commercial-scale power plant, Arc, will be the first of its kind. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does it appear that OpenAI has lost its fight to keep news organizations from digging through 20 million ChatGPT logs to find evidence of copyright infringement—but also OpenAI now faces calls for sanctions and demands to retrieve and share potentially millions of deleted chats long thought of as untouchable in the litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, US District Judge Sidney Stein denied objections that OpenAI raised, claiming that Magistrate Judge Ona Wang failed to adequately balance the privacy interests of ChatGPT users who are not involved in the litigation when ordering OpenAI to produce 20 million logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, OpenAI wanted Stein to agree that it would be much less burdensome to users if OpenAI ran search terms to find potentially infringing outputs in the sample. That way, news plaintiffs would only get access to chats that were relevant to its case, OpenAI suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Stein found that Wang appropriately weighed ChatGPT users’ privacy interests when ordering OpenAI to produce the logs. For example, to shield ChatGPT users, the total number of logs shared was substantially reduced from tens of billions to 20 million, he wrote, and OpenAI has stripped all identifying information from any chats that will be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stein further agreed that news plaintiffs needed access to the entire sample because, as Wang wrote, even “output logs that do not contain reproductions of News Plaintiffs’ works may still be relevant to OpenAI’s fair use defense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although OpenAI argued that Wang should have approved the “least burdensome” path to users’ privacy, the AI company cited no case law to support that argument, Stein wrote, nor its claims that Wang owed them any explanation for rejecting that path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Judge Wang’s failure to explain explicitly why she rejected OpenAI’s search term proposal is not clearly erroneous or contrary to law given that she adequately explained her reasons for ordering production of the entirety of the 20 million de-identified log sample,” Stein wrote, affirming Wang’s order.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is currently reviewing if there are any avenues left to fight the order, but it basically looks like the end of the road, after the AI firm vowed to do everything in its power to avoid sharing ordinary users’ conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for comment, OpenAI pointed Ars to a blog documenting its fight, last updated in mid-December. That blog confirmed that all data that will be shared has “undergone a de-identification process intended to remove or mask PII and other private information.” News plaintiffs will be able to search the data but will be unable to copy or print any data not directly relevant to the case, OpenAI said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI faces calls for sanctions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News groups, spearheaded by The New York Times, believe that output logs will show evidence of infringing chatbot responses, as well as responses that water down news organizations’ trademarks or remove copyright management information (CMI) to obscure the source and facilitate unlicensed outputs of their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They appear beyond frustrated by what their court filings described as delay tactics from OpenAI and co-defendant Microsoft, which has agreed to share 8.1 million Copilot logs but won’t say exactly when those logs will be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year, news organizations asked the court to consider whether sanctions on OpenAI may be warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegedly, it took 11 months for news groups to learn that “OpenAI was destroying relevant output log data” by failing to suspend deletion practices as soon as litigation started—including a “quite substantial” fraction of ChatGPT Free, Pro, and Plus output log data. This data, which was allegedly deleted at a “disproportionately higher rate,” is most likely where infringing materials would be found, news groups claimed, as users prompting ChatGPT to skirt paywalls would most likely set chats to delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI provided “no explanation for why it was destroying roughly 1/3 of all user conversation data in the month after [The New York Times] filed suit other than the irrelevant non-sequitur that the ‘number of ChatGPT conversations was uncharacteristically low (shortly before New Year’s Day 2024),’” the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Describing OpenAI’s alleged “playbook” to dodge copyright claims, news groups accused OpenAI of failing to “take any steps to suspend its routine destruction practices.” There were also “two spikes in mass deletion” that OpenAI attributed to “technical issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, OpenAI made sure to retain outputs that could help its defense, the court filing alleged, including data from accounts cited in news organizations’ complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI did not take the same care to preserve chats that could be used as evidence against it, news groups alleged, citing testimony from Mike Trinh, OpenAI’s associate general counsel. “In other words, OpenAI preserved evidence of the News Plaintiffs eliciting their own works from OpenAI’s products but deleted evidence of third-party users doing so,” the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how much data was deleted, plaintiffs alleged, since OpenAI won’t share “the most basic information” on its deletion practices. But it’s allegedly very clear that OpenAI could have done more to preserve the data, since Microsoft apparently had no trouble doing so with Copilot, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News plaintiffs are hoping the court will agree that OpenAI and Microsoft aren’t fighting fair by delaying sharing logs, which they said prevents them from building their strongest case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve asked the court to order Microsoft to “immediately” produce Copilot logs “in a readily searchable remotely-accessible format,” proposing a deadline of January 9 or “within a day of the Court ruling on this motion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined Ars’ request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for OpenAI, it wants to know if the deleted logs, including “mass deletions,” can be retrieved, perhaps bringing millions more ChatGPT conversations into the litigation that users likely expected would never see the light of day again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of possible sanctions, news plaintiffs asked the court to keep in place a preservation order blocking OpenAI from permanently deleting users’ temporary and deleted chats. They also want the court to order OpenAI to explain “the full scope of destroyed output log data for all of its products at issue” in the litigation and whether those deleted chats can be restored, so that news plaintiffs can examine them as evidence, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Judge Wang’s failure to explain explicitly why she rejected OpenAI’s search term proposal is not clearly erroneous or contrary to law given that she adequately explained her reasons for ordering production of the entirety of the 20 million de-identified log sample,” Stein wrote, affirming Wang’s order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is currently reviewing if there are any avenues left to fight the order, but it basically looks like the end of the road, after the AI firm vowed to do everything in its power to avoid sharing ordinary users’ conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for comment, OpenAI pointed Ars to a blog documenting its fight, last updated in mid-December. That blog confirmed that all data that will be shared has “undergone a de-identification process intended to remove or mask PII and other private information.” News plaintiffs will be able to search the data but will be unable to copy or print any data not directly relevant to the case, OpenAI said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI faces calls for sanctions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News groups, spearheaded by The New York Times, believe that output logs will show evidence of infringing chatbot responses, as well as responses that water down news organizations’ trademarks or remove copyright management information (CMI) to obscure the source and facilitate unlicensed outputs of their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They appear beyond frustrated by what their court filings described as delay tactics from OpenAI and co-defendant Microsoft, which has agreed to share 8.1 million Copilot logs but won’t say exactly when those logs will be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year, news organizations asked the court to consider whether sanctions on OpenAI may be warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegedly, it took 11 months for news groups to learn that “OpenAI was destroying relevant output log data” by failing to suspend deletion practices as soon as litigation started—including a “quite substantial” fraction of ChatGPT Free, Pro, and Plus output log data. This data, which was allegedly deleted at a “disproportionately higher rate,” is most likely where infringing materials would be found, news groups claimed, as users prompting ChatGPT to skirt paywalls would most likely set chats to delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI provided “no explanation for why it was destroying roughly 1/3 of all user conversation data in the month after [The New York Times] filed suit other than the irrelevant non-sequitur that the ‘number of ChatGPT conversations was uncharacteristically low (shortly before New Year’s Day 2024),’” the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Describing OpenAI’s alleged “playbook” to dodge copyright claims, news groups accused OpenAI of failing to “take any steps to suspend its routine destruction practices.” There were also “two spikes in mass deletion” that OpenAI attributed to “technical issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, OpenAI made sure to retain outputs that could help its defense, the court filing alleged, including data from accounts cited in news organizations’ complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI did not take the same care to preserve chats that could be used as evidence against it, news groups alleged, citing testimony from Mike Trinh, OpenAI’s associate general counsel. “In other words, OpenAI preserved evidence of the News Plaintiffs eliciting their own works from OpenAI’s products but deleted evidence of third-party users doing so,” the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how much data was deleted, plaintiffs alleged, since OpenAI won’t share “the most basic information” on its deletion practices. But it’s allegedly very clear that OpenAI could have done more to preserve the data, since Microsoft apparently had no trouble doing so with Copilot, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News plaintiffs are hoping the court will agree that OpenAI and Microsoft aren’t fighting fair by delaying sharing logs, which they said prevents them from building their strongest case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve asked the court to order Microsoft to “immediately” produce Copilot logs “in a readily searchable remotely-accessible format,” proposing a deadline of January 9 or “within a day of the Court ruling on this motion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined Ars’ request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for OpenAI, it wants to know if the deleted logs, including “mass deletions,” can be retrieved, perhaps bringing millions more ChatGPT conversations into the litigation that users likely expected would never see the light of day again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of possible sanctions, news plaintiffs asked the court to keep in place a preservation order blocking OpenAI from permanently deleting users’ temporary and deleted chats. They also want the court to order OpenAI to explain “the full scope of destroyed output log data for all of its products at issue” in the litigation and whether those deleted chats can be restored, so that news plaintiffs can examine them as evidence, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The platform will include hardware and software, Intel vice president and general manager of PC products, Daniel Rogers, announced at CES on Monday. It will be built off of the company’s Intel Core Series 3 processors, known as Panther Lake, which was announced last year and is now being rolled out in a variety of PCs.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This future platform includes a chip specifically for handheld gaming devices, according to reporting from IGN, which was confirmed by TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These Panther Lake chips are the company’s first built on its 18A manufacturing process, which started production in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel is no stranger to the gaming industry and has been building chips for gaming PCs since the 1990s. The company leaned more heavily into gaming in 2022 with the release of its Intel Arc GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Entering the handheld gaming space would be an interesting development, though, as the market is currently dominated by AMD. AMD just announced a new processor designed for gaming PCs, AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, in its CES keynote on Monday, in addition to new ray tracing and graphics technologies for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rogers said Intel will share more details about its new products for handheld gaming devices later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We’re here to spotlight the wildest products we’ve found so far at CES 2026, from an AI-powered panda that responds to your touch, to Razer’s holographic anime assistant, and plenty more weirdness that makes you do a double-take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-ai-anime-companion-that-watches-you-from-your-desk-nbsp"&gt;An AI anime companion that watches you from your desk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Razer’s Project AVA, originally introduced last year as an esports AI coach, has evolved into something new: a 5.5-inch animated holographic desk companion that can assist with gaming strategies, productivity, daily organization, and even personal advice. It’s both a gaming ally and an everyday assistant. Users can choose from different characters, such as the anime girl Kira or the muscular Zane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These digital avatars feature lifelike movements, eye-tracking, expressive faces, and lip-syncing for realistic interactions. What really stands out, though, is the constant monitoring — the device watches you and your screen using the built-in camera. It’s a bit unsettling, but since it’s still just a concept, there’s no guarantee it’ll ever become a real product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-cuddly-ai-baby-panda-robot-for-older-adults"&gt;A cuddly AI baby panda robot for older adults&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080424" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AI-Panda-AnAN.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;AI Panda An’An rests by the window on the desk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Mind With Heart Robotics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An’An, the latest AI pet from Mind with Heart Robotics, combines an adorable design with a meaningful mission: supporting elderly care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The panda bot has high-tech sensors all over its body, so it reacts naturally when you touch it. Its emotional AI remembers your voice, how you interact, and what you like, so the longer you spend time with An’An, the more personalized it gets. It provides around-the-clock emotional support to combat loneliness. Additionally, for older adults who might be struggling with memory, An’An helps keep them engaged, reminds them about daily tasks, and keeps caregivers in the loop about their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-500-ice-cube-maker-that-uses-ai-to-reduce-noise"&gt;A $500 ice cube maker that uses AI to reduce noise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080426" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/goveelife-smart-nugget-ice-maker.jpeg?w=660" width="660" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;GoveeLife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Smart home appliance brand GoveeLife unveiled a countertop smart ice maker that uses AI to keep things nice and quiet. The company’s patented AI NoiseGuard tech is designed to cut down on all the annoying racket you usually get from nugget ice machines. The AI detects when the machine’s about to freeze up and make noise, so it automatically defrosts before things get loud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​The Smart Nugget Ice Maker Pro churns out fresh ice in just six minutes and can make up to 60 pounds in a day. The bucket holds 3.5 pounds of ice at a time. It’ll set you back $499.99 — which might make you think twice — but if you’re ready to upgrade your ice game, you can grab one starting January 15 at Amazon, govee.com, Walmart, or Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-ultrasonic-chef-s-knife-that-vibrates-when-slicing-and-dicing"&gt;An ultrasonic chef’s knife that vibrates when slicing and dicing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080427" height="436" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ultrasonic-knife.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Seattle Ultrasonics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Depending on who you ask, this kitchen gadget could either seem too silly or very useful. Unlike traditional knives, this one from Seattle Ultrasonics features a blade that vibrates at over 30,000 times per second, allowing it to move through food with ease. This vibration technology means the knife acts much sharper than its physical edge, making tasks like slicing vegetables, meats, or bread much easier for cooks. According to the company, the vibrations are so subtle that you can’t see the blade move, hear it, or feel anything in the handle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The knife is priced at $399 and is currently available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-musical-lollipop-that-plays-ice-spice-in-your-head"&gt;A musical lollipop that plays Ice Spice in your head&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musical toothbrushes exist, so why not have music-playing lollipops too? Lollipop Star showcased its tasty product at CES, which delivers music through bone conduction while in your mouth. (The technology works by sending vibrations through your skull bones directly to your inner ear.) The lollipops also provide a burst of fruity flavor. You can choose from three artists: Ice Spice (peach), Akon (blueberry), and Armani White (lime).&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;While CES 2026 is full of tech giants unveiling their latest innovations, the real excitement comes from discovering unexpected, quirky gadgets that make you ask, “Who thought of this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-500-ice-cube-maker-that-uses-ai-to-reduce-noise"&gt;A $500 ice cube maker that uses AI to reduce noise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080426" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/goveelife-smart-nugget-ice-maker.jpeg?w=660" width="660" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;GoveeLife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Smart home appliance brand GoveeLife unveiled a countertop smart ice maker that uses AI to keep things nice and quiet. The company’s patented AI NoiseGuard tech is designed to cut down on all the annoying racket you usually get from nugget ice machines. The AI detects when the machine’s about to freeze up and make noise, so it automatically defrosts before things get loud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​The Smart Nugget Ice Maker Pro churns out fresh ice in just six minutes and can make up to 60 pounds in a day. The bucket holds 3.5 pounds of ice at a time. It’ll set you back $499.99 — which might make you think twice — but if you’re ready to upgrade your ice game, you can grab one starting January 15 at Amazon, govee.com, Walmart, or Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-ultrasonic-chef-s-knife-that-vibrates-when-slicing-and-dicing"&gt;An ultrasonic chef’s knife that vibrates when slicing and dicing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080427" height="436" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ultrasonic-knife.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Seattle Ultrasonics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Depending on who you ask, this kitchen gadget could either seem too silly or very useful. Unlike traditional knives, this one from Seattle Ultrasonics features a blade that vibrates at over 30,000 times per second, allowing it to move through food with ease. This vibration technology means the knife acts much sharper than its physical edge, making tasks like slicing vegetables, meats, or bread much easier for cooks. According to the company, the vibrations are so subtle that you can’t see the blade move, hear it, or feel anything in the handle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The knife is priced at $399 and is currently available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musical toothbrushes exist, so why not have music-playing lollipops too? Lollipop Star showcased its tasty product at CES, which delivers music through bone conduction while in your mouth. (The technology works by sending vibrations through your skull bones directly to your inner ear.) The lollipops also provide a burst of fruity flavor. You can choose from three artists: Ice Spice (peach), Akon (blueberry), and Armani White (lime).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/the-most-bizarre-tech-announced-so-far-at-ces-2026/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:10:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] California lawmaker proposes a four-year ban on AI chatbots in kids’ toys (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/california-lawmaker-proposes-a-four-year-ban-on-ai-chatbots-in-kids-toys/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2226429342.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Senator Steve Padilla (D-CA) introduced a bill on Monday that would place a four-year ban on the sale and manufacture of toys with AI chatbot capabilities for kids under 18. The goal is to give safety regulators time to develop regulations to protect children from “dangerous AI interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Chatbots and other AI tools may become integral parts of our lives in the future, but the dangers they pose now require us to take bold action to protect our children,” Senator Padilla said in a statement. “Our safety regulations around this kind of technology are in their infancy and will need to grow as exponentially as the capabilities of this technology do. Pausing the sale of these chatbot-integrated toys allows us time to craft the appropriate safety guidelines and framework for these toys to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The bill, dubbed SB 867, comes in the wake of President Trump’s recent executive order directing federal agencies to challenge state AI laws in court — though the order explicitly carves out exceptions for state laws related to child safety.&amp;nbsp;The legislation also follows several concerning incidents involving AI, chatbots, and children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the past year, lawsuits filed by families whose children died by suicide after engaging in prolonged conversations with chatbots have spurred lawmakers to action. Padilla also co-authored California’s recently passed SB 243, which requires chatbot operators to implement safeguards to protect children and vulnerable users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the use of chatbots in toys isn’t as mainstream yet, there have already been reports of troubling interactions. In November 2025, consumer advocacy group PIRG Education Fund warned that toys like Kumma — a cute toy bear with a built-in chatbot — could be prompted easily to talk about matches, knives, and sexual topics. NBC News found that Miiloo, an “AI toy for kids” made by Chinese company Miriat, would at times indicate that it was programmed to reflect Chinese Communist Party values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Barbie-maker Mattel were slated to release an “AI-powered product” in 2025, but delayed their release. Neither company explained the delay, and it’s not clear if they plan to release a toy in 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our children cannot be used as lab rats for Big Tech to experiment on,” Padilla said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		How to build accurate, low-latency visual document retrieval with small Llama Nemotron models that work out-of-the-box with standard vector databases
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
In real applications, data is not just text. It lives in PDFs with charts, scanned contracts, tables, screenshots, and slide decks, so a text-only retrieval system will miss important information. Multimodal RAG pipelines change this by enabling retrieval and reasoning over text, images, and layouts together, leading  to more accurate and actionable answers.
&lt;p&gt;This post walks through two small Llama Nemotron models for multimodal retrieval over visual documents: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both models are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small enough to run with most NVIDIA GPU resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatible with standard vector databases (single dense vector per page)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designed to reduce hallucinations by grounding generation on better evidence, not longer prompts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will show how they behave on realistic document benchmarks below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Why multimodal RAG needs world-class retrieval
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multimodal RAG pipelines&lt;/strong&gt; combine a retriever with a vision-language model (VLM) so responses are grounded in both retrieved page text and visual content, not just raw text prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embeddings&lt;/strong&gt; control which pages are retrieved and shown to the VLM. &lt;strong&gt;Reranking models&lt;/strong&gt; decide which of those pages are most relevant and should influence the answer. If either step is inaccurate, the VLM is more likely to hallucinate—often with high confidence. Using multimodal embeddings together with a multimodal reranker keeps generation grounded in the correct page images and text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		The State-of-the-Art in Commercial Multimodal Search
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2&lt;/i&gt; models
are designed for developers building multimodal question-answering and search over large corpora of PDFs and images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2 model is a single-vector (dense) embedding model that efficiently condenses visual and textual information into a single representation. This design ensures compatibility with all standard vector databases and enables millisecond-latency search at enterprise scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;llama-nemotron-rerank-v1-1b-v2 is a cross-encoder reranking model that reorders the top retrieved candidates to improve relevance and boosts downstream answer quality without changing your storage or index format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2 and llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2  on five visual document retrieval datasets: the popular ViDoRe V1, V2 and V3, a realistic visual document retrieval benchmark for enterprises composed of 8 public datasets, and two internal visual document retrieval datasets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DigitalCorpora-10k: A dataset with over 1300 questions based on a corpus of 10,000 documents from DigitalCorpora that have a good mixture of text, tables, and charts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings V2: An internal retrieval dataset of 287 questions based on 500 PDFs, mostly consisting of earnings reports from big tech companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Visual Document Retrieval (page retrieval) benchmarks
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below reports the average retrieval accuracy (Recall@5) across five datasets, focusing specifically on commercially viable dense retrieval models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that the llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2 provides better retrieval accuracy (Recall@5) for the image and image+text modalities than its predecessor, llama-3.2-nemoretriever-1b-vlm-embed-v1 and also better on text modality than llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2, our small text embedding model. Finally, our VLM reranker llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2 improves retrieval accuracy further by 7.2%, 6.9% and 6% per modality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Image+Text modality means that both the page image and its text (extracted using ingestion libraries like NV-Ingest) are fed as input to the embedding model for more accurate representation and retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Document Retrieval benchmarks (page retrieval) – Avg Recall@5 on DigitalCorpora-10k, Earnings V2, ViDoRe V1, V2, V3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		Architectural Highlights &amp;amp; Training Methodology
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2 embedding model is a transformer-based encoder model, with approximately 1.7B parameters. It is a fine-tuned version of the NVIDIA Eagle family of models, using the Llama 3.2 1B language model and SigLip2 400M vision encoder. Embedding models for retrieval are typically trained with a bi-encoder architecture that encodes query and document independently. The model applies mean pooling over the output token embeddings from the language model, so that it outputs a single embedding with 2048 dimensions. Contrastive learning is used to train the embedding model to increase similarity between queries and relevant documents while decreasing similarity to negative samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2 is a cross-encoder model with approximately 1.7B parameters. It is also a fine-tuned version of an NVIDIA Eagle-family model. The final layer hidden states of the language model are aggregated using a mean pooling strategy, and a binary classification head is fine-tuned for the ranking task. The model was trained with  CrossEntropy loss using publicly available and synthetically generated datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

		How Organizations are Using These Models
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three examples of how organizations are applying the new Nemotron embedding and reranking models that you can adapt in your own systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cadence: design and EDA workflows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cadence models logic design assets such as micro-architecture and specification documents, constraints, and verification collateral as connected multimodal documents. As a result, an engineer can ask, “I want to extend the interrupt controller to support a low power state, show me which spec sections need changes,” and instantly surface the most relevant requirements. The system can then suggest a few alternative specification-update strategies, compare their tradeoffs, and generate the corresponding spec edits for the option the user selects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IBM: domain-heavy storage and infra docs&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;IBM Storage treats each page of long PDFs—product guides, configuration manuals, and architecture diagrams—as a multimodal document, embeds it, and uses the reranker to prioritize pages where domain-specific terms, acronyms, and product names appear in the correct context before sending them to downstream LLMs. This improves how AI systems interpret storage concepts and reason over complex infrastructure documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ServiceNow: chat over large sets of PDFs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ServiceNow uses multimodal embeddings to index pages from organizational PDFs and then applies the reranker to select the most relevant pages for each user query in its “Chat with PDF” experiences. By keeping high-scoring pages in context across turns, their agents maintain more coherent conversations and help users navigate large document collections more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

		Get Started
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try the models directly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;i&gt;llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2&lt;/i&gt; in your vector database of choice to power multimodal search over PDFs and images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;i&gt;llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2&lt;/i&gt; as a second-stage reranker on your top-k results to improve retrieval quality without changing your index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download Nemotron RAG models if you want end-to-end components for agents. Models aren’t limited to standalone use—they can also be integrated into ingestion pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plug the new models into your existing RAG stack, or combine them with other open models on Hugging Face to build multimodal agents that understand your PDFs, not just their extracted text.&lt;/p&gt;

		How to build accurate, low-latency visual document retrieval with small Llama Nemotron models that work out-of-the-box with standard vector databases
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
In real applications, data is not just text. It lives in PDFs with charts, scanned contracts, tables, screenshots, and slide decks, so a text-only retrieval system will miss important information. Multimodal RAG pipelines change this by enabling retrieval and reasoning over text, images, and layouts together, leading  to more accurate and actionable answers.
&lt;p&gt;This post walks through two small Llama Nemotron models for multimodal retrieval over visual documents: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both models are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small enough to run with most NVIDIA GPU resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatible with standard vector databases (single dense vector per page)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designed to reduce hallucinations by grounding generation on better evidence, not longer prompts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will show how they behave on realistic document benchmarks below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Why multimodal RAG needs world-class retrieval
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multimodal RAG pipelines&lt;/strong&gt; combine a retriever with a vision-language model (VLM) so responses are grounded in both retrieved page text and visual content, not just raw text prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embeddings&lt;/strong&gt; control which pages are retrieved and shown to the VLM. &lt;strong&gt;Reranking models&lt;/strong&gt; decide which of those pages are most relevant and should influence the answer. If either step is inaccurate, the VLM is more likely to hallucinate—often with high confidence. Using multimodal embeddings together with a multimodal reranker keeps generation grounded in the correct page images and text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		The State-of-the-Art in Commercial Multimodal Search
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2&lt;/i&gt; models
are designed for developers building multimodal question-answering and search over large corpora of PDFs and images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2 model is a single-vector (dense) embedding model that efficiently condenses visual and textual information into a single representation. This design ensures compatibility with all standard vector databases and enables millisecond-latency search at enterprise scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;llama-nemotron-rerank-v1-1b-v2 is a cross-encoder reranking model that reorders the top retrieved candidates to improve relevance and boosts downstream answer quality without changing your storage or index format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2 and llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2  on five visual document retrieval datasets: the popular ViDoRe V1, V2 and V3, a realistic visual document retrieval benchmark for enterprises composed of 8 public datasets, and two internal visual document retrieval datasets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DigitalCorpora-10k: A dataset with over 1300 questions based on a corpus of 10,000 documents from DigitalCorpora that have a good mixture of text, tables, and charts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings V2: An internal retrieval dataset of 287 questions based on 500 PDFs, mostly consisting of earnings reports from big tech companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Visual Document Retrieval (page retrieval) benchmarks
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below reports the average retrieval accuracy (Recall@5) across five datasets, focusing specifically on commercially viable dense retrieval models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that the llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2 provides better retrieval accuracy (Recall@5) for the image and image+text modalities than its predecessor, llama-3.2-nemoretriever-1b-vlm-embed-v1 and also better on text modality than llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2, our small text embedding model. Finally, our VLM reranker llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2 improves retrieval accuracy further by 7.2%, 6.9% and 6% per modality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Image+Text modality means that both the page image and its text (extracted using ingestion libraries like NV-Ingest) are fed as input to the embedding model for more accurate representation and retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Document Retrieval benchmarks (page retrieval) – Avg Recall@5 on DigitalCorpora-10k, Earnings V2, ViDoRe V1, V2, V3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below demonstrates the accuracy evaluation of &lt;code&gt;llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2&lt;/code&gt; compared to two other publicly available multimodal reranker models: &lt;code&gt;jina-reranker-m0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MonoQwen2-VL-v0.1&lt;/code&gt;. Although &lt;code&gt;jina-reranker-m0&lt;/code&gt;, performs well on image-only tasks, its public weights are restricted to non-commercial use (CC-BY-NC). In contrast, &lt;code&gt;llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2&lt;/code&gt; offers superior performance across Text and combined Image+Text modalities, and its permissive commercial license makes it an ideal choice for enterprise deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

But a quake also generates a flash of heat and fractures and damages underground rocks. And exactly how much energy goes into each of these three processes is exceedingly difficult to measure in the field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, with the help of carefully controlled miniature “lab quakes,” MIT geophysicist Matěj Peč and colleagues have quantified this so-called energy budget. Only about 1% to 10% of a lab quake’s energy causes physical shaking, they found, while 1% to 30% goes into breaking up rock and creating new surfaces. The vast majority heats up the area around a quake’s epicenter, producing a temperature spike that can actually melt surrounding material.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The team also found that the fractions of quake energy producing heat, shaking, and rock fracturing can shift depending on the tectonic activity the region has experienced in the past. “The deformation history—essentially what the rock remembers—really influences how destructive an earthquake could be,” says postdoc Daniel Ortega-Arroyo, PhD ’25, lead author of a paper on the work. “That history affects a lot of the material properties in the rock, and it dictates to some degree how it is going to slip.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The lab quakes—which involve subjecting specially prepared samples of powdered granite and magnetic particles to steadily increasing pressure in a custom-built apparatus—are a simplified analogue of what occurs during a natural earthquake.

A new MIT study reveals what happens biologically as these momentary lapses occur: Your brain is performing essential maintenance that it usually takes care of while you sleep.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During a normal night of sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that cushions the brain helps flush away metabolic waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019 study, MIT electrical engineering and computer science professor Laura Lewis, PhD ’14, and colleagues showed that the CSF flows rhythmically in and out in a way that’s linked to changes in brain waves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To explore what might happen to this CSF flow in a sleep-deprived brain, Lewis, who is also a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and her colleagues tested 26 volunteers on several cognitive tasks after they’d been kept awake in the lab and when they were well-rested. Using both electroencephalograms and functional magnetic resonance imaging, the researchers measured heart rate, breathing rate, pupil diameter, blood oxygenation in the brain, and flow of CSF in and out of the brain as participants tried to press a button when they heard a beep or saw a visual change on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested ones. Their response times were slower, and in some cases the participants never noticed the stimulus at all.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The researchers identified several physiological changes during these lapses of attention. Most significant was a flow of CSF out of the brain just as a lapse occurred—and back in as it ended. The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it “attempts to catch up on this process by initiating pulses of CSF flow,” as Lewis says, even at the cost of one’s ability to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” says Zinong Yang, a postdoctoral associate and lead author of a paper on the work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after attention returned.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain—our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world—and then also really basic, fundamental physiological processes.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The researchers did not explore what this circuit might be, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine—and has recently been shown to oscillate during normal sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-499315680_20b3a1.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone has experienced it—after a night of poor sleep, your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.

QMIT will enable scientists and engineers to co-develop quantum tools, generating unprecedented capabilities in science, technology, industry, and national security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although QMIT is a new initiative, it grew naturally from the Center for Quantum Engineering (CQE), created in 2019 to help bridge the gap between PIs at MIT and Lincoln Laboratory.

We hope that as the initiative evolves, our alumni and friends will be inspired to join us in supporting this exciting new effort to build on MIT’s quantum legacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/06/1128993/investing-in-the-promise-of-quantum/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Hands-on engineering (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/06/1128990/hands-on-engineering/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54884193153_8c4eb45a75_o.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since nuclear fusion was discovered in the 1930s, scientists have wondered if we could somehow replicate and harness the phenomenon behind starlight—the smashing together of hydrogen atoms to form helium and a stupendous amount of clean energy. Fusing hydrogen would yield &lt;em&gt;200 million &lt;/em&gt;times more energy than simply burning it. Unlike nuclear fission, which powers the world’s 440 atomic reactors, hydrogen fusion produces no harmful radiation, only neutrons that are captured and added back to the reaction. Instead of radioactive wastes with long, lethal half-lives, fusion’s by-product is helium, the most stable element—and a year’s worth from a fusion plant wouldn’t supply a party balloon business.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dennis Whyte’s part in the fusion quest began in graduate school, in a lab belonging to the electric utility Hydro-Québec, just outside Montreal. There he was shown a device built to replicate stellar fusion on an earthly scale. It was a doughnut-shaped hollow chamber, big enough for a lanky physicist like him to stand inside, based on a design conceived in 1950 by the future Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov, who also developed hydrogen bombs for the Soviet Union. It was called a tokamak, a word derived from a Russian phrase meaning “ring-shaped chamber with magnetic coils.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dennis Whyte in profile speaking in front of trade show banners" class="wp-image-1130440" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MIT-Fusion-Landscape20-01-PRESS_0.jpg?w=1507" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dennis Whyte, then director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, describes efforts to address climate change through carbon-free power at a conference in 2019.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GRETCHEN ERTL&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea is straightforward: Fill the doughnut with hydrogen gas, and then heat that gas until it turns to electrically charged plasma. In this ionic state, plasma would be held in place by magnets positioned around the tokamak. Achieving fusion on Earth without the immense pressure of a star’s interior, scientists calculated, would require temperatures nearly 10 times hotter than our sun’s center—around 100 million degrees Celsius. So the trick would be to suspend the hot plasma so perfectly in a surrounding magnetic field that it wouldn’t touch inner surfaces of the chamber. Such contact would instantly cool it, stopping the fusion reaction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The good part about that was safety. In a failure, a fusion power plant wouldn’t melt down—just the opposite. The bad part was that gaseous plasma wasn’t very cooperative—any slight irregularity in the chamber walls could cause destabilizing turbulence. But the concept was so tantalizing that by the mid-1980s, 75 universities and governmental institutes around the world had tokamaks. If anyone could get fusion—the most energy-dense reaction in the universe—to work, the deuterium in a liter of seawater could meet one person’s electricity needs for a year. It would be, effectively, a limitless resource.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Besides turbulence, there were two other big obstacles. The magnets surrounding the plasma needed to be really powerful—meaning really big. In 1986, 35 nations representing half the world’s population—including the US, China, India, Japan, what is now the entire European Union, South Korea, and Russia—agreed to jointly build the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, a $40 billion giant tokamak in southern France. Standing 100 feet tall on a 180-acre site, ITER (the acronym also formed the Latin word for “journey”) is equipped with 18 magnets weighing 360 tons apiece, made from the best superconductors then available. If it works, ITER will produce 500 megawatts of electricity—but not before 2035, if then. It’s still under construction. The second obstacle is the biggest: Many tokamaks have briefly achieved fusion, but doing so always took more energy than they produced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After earning his doctorate in 1992, Whyte worked on an ITER prototype at San Diego’s National Fusion Facility, taught at the University of Wisconsin, and in 2006 was hired by MIT. By then, he understood how huge the stakes were, and how life-changing commercial-scale fusion energy could be—if it could be sustained, and if it could be produced affordably.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;MIT had been trying since 1969. The red brick buildings of its Plasma Science and Fusion Center, where Whyte came to work, had originally housed the National Biscuit Company. PSFC’s sixth tokamak, Alcator C-Mod, built in 1991, was in Nabisco’s old Oreo cookie factory. C-Mod’s magnets were coiled with copper to serve as a conductor (think of how copper wire wrapped around a nail and connected to a battery turns it into an electromagnet). Before C-Mod was finally decommissioned, its magnetic fields, 160,000 times stronger than Earth’s, set the world record for the highest plasma pressure in a tokamak.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Ohm’s law describes, however, metals like copper have internal resistance, so it could run for only four seconds before overheating—and needed more energy to ignite its fusion reactions than what came out of it. Like the now 160 similar tokamaks around the world, C-Mod was an interesting science experiment but mainly reinforced the joke that fusion energy was 20 years away and always would be.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each year, Whyte had challenged PhD students in his fusion design classes to conjure something just as compact as C-Mod, one-800th the scale of ITER, that could achieve and sustain fusion—with an energy gain. But in 2013, as he neared 50, he increasingly had doubts. He’d devoted his career to the fusion dream, but unless something radically changed, he feared it wouldn’t happen in his lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US Department of Energy decided to scale back on fusion. It informed MIT that funding for Alcator C-Mod would end in 2016. So Whyte decided he would either quit fusion and do something else or try something different to get there faster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a new generation of ceramic “high-temperature” superconductors, not available when ITER’s huge magnets were being wrapped in metallic superconducting cable, which has to be chilled to 4 kelvin above absolute zero (–452.47&amp;nbsp;°F) for its resistance to current to fall to zero. Discovered accidentally in 1986 in a Swiss lab, the new ceramic superconductors still needed to be cooled to 20 K (–423.7&amp;nbsp;°F). But with far smaller power requirements, their output was so much greater that a year later the discoverers won a Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The potential applications were limitless, but because ceramic is so brittle, coiling it around electromagnets wasn’t feasible. Then one day Whyte ran into research scientist Leslie Bromberg ’73, PhD ’77, in the hallway holding a fistful of what resembled unspooled tape from a VCR cassette. “What’s all that?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Superconducting tape, new stuff.” The filmy strips were coated with ceramic crystals of rare-earth barium copper oxide. “It’s called ReBCO,” Bromberg said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ReBCO’s rare-earth component, yttrium, is 400 times more common than silver. Could superconducting tape, Whyte immediately wondered, be wound like copper wire to make much smaller but far more powerful magnets?&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The class met in a windowless room in a former Nabisco cracker factory, surrounded by blackboards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He assigned his 2013 fusion design class to see. If the students managed to double the strength of a magnetic field surrounding hot plasma, he knew, they might multiply fusion’s power density sixteenfold. They came up with an eye-­opening design they called Vulcan. It yielded five peer-reviewed papers—but whether layers of wound ReBCO tape could stand the stress of the current needed to hold plasma suspended while being superheated to ignite a fusion reaction was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For two years, his classes refined Vulcan. By 2015, with ReBCO more consistent in quality and supply, he challenged his students—11 male and one female, including an Argentine, a Russian, and a Korean—to outdo what 35 nations had been attempting for nearly 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Let’s see if ReBCO lets us build a 500-megawatt tokamak—the same as ITER, only way smaller.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If superconducting tape could let them make a fusion reactor to fit the footprint of a decommissioned coal-fired plant, he told them, it could plug right into existing power lines. To then make enough carbon-­free energy to stop pushing Earth’s climate past the edge, its components would have to be mass-­producible, so any competent contractor could assemble and service them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The class met in a windowless room in a former Nabisco cracker factory, surrounded by blackboards. Divided into teams, the students set about figuring out how thin-tape electromagnets could be made robust, and how to capture neutrons expelled from fusion reactions so their heat could be used for turning a turbine—and so they could be harnessed to breed more tritium for the plasma. That’s crucial, because natural tritium is exceedingly rare. Since ReBCO-wrapped magnets would be so much smaller, shrinking the dimensions of one component rippled through everything else. One team’s innovations fed another’s, and parts of the design started to link together. As excitement spread through PSFC, members of earlier classes, now postdocs or faculty members, pitched in. Whyte’s students, some with doctoral dissertations due, were putting in 50-hour weeks on this, reminding him of why he’d dreamed of fusion in first place.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whyte looked it over for the thousandth time. He was pretty sure they hadn’t broken any laws of physics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And then, at the semester’s end, out popped their design. Just over 10 feet in diameter, it actually looked like a prototype power plant. While ITER had massive shielding, their tokamak would be wrapped in a compact blanket containing a molten-salt mixture of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride to absorb the heat of the neutrons escaping from the fusion reaction. Those neutrons would also react with the lithium to breed more tritium.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The blanket’s heat would be tapped for electricity—except one-fifth of the heat energy would remain in the plasma, meaning the reaction was now heating itself and was self-sustaining, producing more energy than was needed to ignite it. Net fusion energy had been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ReBCO magnets, although just a 40th the size of ITER’s, could deliver a magnetic field strength of 23 tesla (a hospital MRI machine typically operates at 1.5 tesla). That was more than enough to achieve a fusion reaction, yet it would require less electricity than its copper-clad C-Mod predecessor by a factor of 2,000. Everything was designed for easy maintenance, and parts could be replaced without having to dismantle the entire reactor.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Most important, the calculated energy output was more than 13 times the input.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whyte looked it over for the thousandth time. He was pretty sure they hadn’t broken any laws of physics. He calculated the cost per watt and was astonished. Suddenly their goal wasn’t just building a much smaller ITER. It was being commercially competitive.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Stunned, he told his wife, “This can actually work.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They called it ARC, for “affordable, robust, compact.” “Buildable in a decade,” Whyte predicted&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;The peer-reviewed article his 12 students published in &lt;em&gt;FusionEngineering and Design &lt;/em&gt;estimated it would cost around $5 billion. In 2015, that wasn’t much more than the cost of a comparably sized coal-fired plant, and one-eighth ITER’s price tag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That May, Whyte gave a keynote about ARC at a fusion engineering symposium in Austin, Texas. Four of his students attended. When he described their plan for a workable reactor by 2025, in just 10 years, conferees were astounded—everyone else was talking decades. Afterward, the MIT contingent went to lunch at Stubb’s Bar-B-Q. It was clear that with the climate eroding and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warning that yet-­uninvented technologies were needed to keep temperatures from soaring into dreaded realms, they had to do this. But since the DOE had pulled its funding, how could they?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On a napkin, Whyte started listing what they’d need to do and what each step might cost. Over ribs, they crafted a proposal to spin off a startup to raise venture capital to finance a SPARC (for “soon-as-possible ARC”) demo fusion reactor to show that this could really happen. Then they’d build a commercial-scale ARC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="group photo of team standing in the warehouse in front of the reactor" class="wp-image-1130439" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MIT_Fusion-Magnets-04-PRESS.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In 2021, teams from MIT’s Plasma Science Fusion Center and MIT spinout Commonwealth Fusion Systems used just 30 watts of energy to produce a magnetic field strong enough to sustain a fusion reaction.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GRETCHEN ERTL&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Forming a company would free them from academic and government funding cycles, but they were plasma physicists, most still in their 20s, without business backgrounds. Nevertheless, Whyte and Martin Greenwald, deputy director of the PSFC, agreed to join them, and in 2018 Commonwealth Fusion Systems, CFS, was born. Three of his former students would run the company, and three would remain at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, which—in a profit-sharing agreement—would be CFS’s research arm.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They opened shop up the street, in The Engine, MIT’s “tough tech” startup incubator, and gained the attention of climate-concerned backers like Bill Gates, George Soros, and Jeff Bezos. But they weren’t the only ones competing for fusion funds, and it became a race to see who could make commercial-scale fusion first.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The CFS team may have been young, but because of its partnership with MIT and its more than a hundred experienced fusion scientists, it had a running start.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the end of 2021, Commonwealth Fusion Systems had raised more than $2&amp;nbsp;billion and was breaking ground on 47 acres outside Boston for a commercial fusion energy campus, to build SPARC by 2025—and commercial-scale, mass-­producible ARC by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gaining and actually sustaining net energy is perpetually called fusion’s yet-unreached “holy grail,” but by September 2021, the CFS team of CEO Bob Mumgaard, SM ’15, PhD ’15 (a coauthor of the Vulcan design), chief science officer Brandon Sorbom, PhD ’17 (lead author of the 2015 fusion design class’s breakthrough paper), Whyte, and their 200 CFS colleagues were confident they could do it—if their magnets held. For three years, straight through the pandemic, they’d worked in PSFC’s West Cell laboratory, the cavernous former Oreo factory that had housed Alcator C-Mod, furiously solving problems like how to solder thin-film ReBCO tape together into a structure strong enough to withstand 40,000 amps passing through it—enough to power a small town.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The completed SPARC would have 18 magnets encircling its plasma chamber, but for this test they’d built just one. It was composed of 16 layers, each a D-shaped, 10-foot-high steel disk grooved like an LP. On one side, the grooves held tight spirals of ReBCO film, 270 kilometers in all—the distance from Boston to Albany. “Yet all that ReBCO holds just a sprinkling of rare earth,” said Sorbom. “That’s the magic of superconductors: A tiny bit of material can carry so much current. By comparison, a wind turbine’s rare-earth neodymium magnets weigh tons.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On each disk’s flip side, the grooves channeled liquid helium to cool the superconductor for zero resistance. (The design dates to history’s first high-field magnet, built at MIT in the 1930s, which used copper conductors and water for coolant.) Each layer was built on an automated assembly line. “The idea,” said Mumgaard, “is to make 100,000 magnets a year someday. This can’t be a scientific curiosity. This needs to be an energy source.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although covid-19 had waned, an outbreak could foil everything, so they maintained coronavirus protocols, moving computer terminals outside beneath a tent to avoid crowding within. Others worked virtually. For a month, dozens worked eight-hour, continuous shifts. Some operated the electromagnetic coil, encased in stainless steel in the middle of the room, which over a week had to be gradually supercooled from room temperature of 298 K down to 20 K before slowly ramping up to full magnetic strength. Others constantly compared real-time data with redundant models. As the temperature dropped, the internal connections, welds, and valves contracted at different rates, so they watched for leaks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On September 2, 2021, the Thursday before Labor Day, they started ramping up by a few kiloamps, stopping frequently to check what the current was revealing, how the cooling characteristics had changed, and how the stresses on the ReBCO coil increased as the magnetic field strengthened to record heights.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two nights later, they cranked the amperage toward their goal: a 20-tesla magnetic field, powerful enough to lift 421 Boeing 747s or contain a continuous fusion reaction. They’d been aiming for 7:00 a.m. on Sunday, the 5th. At 3:30, the large screen in the design center showed that they’d reached 40 kiloamps, and the magnetic field had reached 19.56 tesla.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At 4:30 a.m., they were at 19.98 tesla. Things got very quiet. At 5:20 a.m., every redundant on-screen meter read 20 tesla, and nothing had leaked or exploded—except under the tent, where champagne corks were popping.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Five years earlier, on its final four-­second run, C-Mod’s copper-conducting magnet had consumed 200 million watts of energy to reach 5.7 tesla. This took 30 watts—less energy by a factor of around 10 million, Whyte told reporters—to produce a magnetic field strong enough to sustain a fusion reaction. The joints that transferred current from one layer to the next actually performed better than expected. That was the biggest unknown, because there was only one way to test them: in the magnet itself. They looked spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130437" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cover.jpg?w=1000" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After five hours, the team ramped down the power. “It’s a Kitty Hawk moment,” Mumgaard said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adapted from &lt;/em&gt;Hope Dies Last: Visionary People Across the World, Fighting to Find Us a Future&lt;em&gt; by Alan Weisman, published by Dutton, an imprint of Penguin Random House. © 2025 by Alan Weisman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever since nuclear fusion was discovered in the 1930s, scientists have wondered if we could somehow replicate and harness the phenomenon behind starlight—the smashing together of hydrogen atoms to form helium and a stupendous amount of clean energy.

It was called a tokamak, a word derived from a Russian phrase meaning “ring-shaped chamber with magnetic coils.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dennis Whyte in profile speaking in front of trade show banners" class="wp-image-1130440" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MIT-Fusion-Landscape20-01-PRESS_0.jpg?w=1507" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dennis Whyte, then director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, describes efforts to address climate change through carbon-free power at a conference in 2019.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GRETCHEN ERTL&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea is straightforward: Fill the doughnut with hydrogen gas, and then heat that gas until it turns to electrically charged plasma. In this ionic state, plasma would be held in place by magnets positioned around the tokamak. Achieving fusion on Earth without the immense pressure of a star’s interior, scientists calculated, would require temperatures nearly 10 times hotter than our sun’s center—around 100 million degrees Celsius. So the trick would be to suspend the hot plasma so perfectly in a surrounding magnetic field that it wouldn’t touch inner surfaces of the chamber. Such contact would instantly cool it, stopping the fusion reaction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The good part about that was safety. In a failure, a fusion power plant wouldn’t melt down—just the opposite. The bad part was that gaseous plasma wasn’t very cooperative—any slight irregularity in the chamber walls could cause destabilizing turbulence. But the concept was so tantalizing that by the mid-1980s, 75 universities and governmental institutes around the world had tokamaks. If anyone could get fusion—the most energy-dense reaction in the universe—to work, the deuterium in a liter of seawater could meet one person’s electricity needs for a year. It would be, effectively, a limitless resource.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Besides turbulence, there were two other big obstacles. The magnets surrounding the plasma needed to be really powerful—meaning really big. In 1986, 35 nations representing half the world’s population—including the US, China, India, Japan, what is now the entire European Union, South Korea, and Russia—agreed to jointly build the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, a $40 billion giant tokamak in southern France. Standing 100 feet tall on a 180-acre site, ITER (the acronym also formed the Latin word for “journey”) is equipped with 18 magnets weighing 360 tons apiece, made from the best superconductors then available. If it works, ITER will produce 500 megawatts of electricity—but not before 2035, if then. It’s still under construction. The second obstacle is the biggest: Many tokamaks have briefly achieved fusion, but doing so always took more energy than they produced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After earning his doctorate in 1992, Whyte worked on an ITER prototype at San Diego’s National Fusion Facility, taught at the University of Wisconsin, and in 2006 was hired by MIT. By then, he understood how huge the stakes were, and how life-changing commercial-scale fusion energy could be—if it could be sustained, and if it could be produced affordably.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;MIT had been trying since 1969. The red brick buildings of its Plasma Science and Fusion Center, where Whyte came to work, had originally housed the National Biscuit Company. PSFC’s sixth tokamak, Alcator C-Mod, built in 1991, was in Nabisco’s old Oreo cookie factory. C-Mod’s magnets were coiled with copper to serve as a conductor (think of how copper wire wrapped around a nail and connected to a battery turns it into an electromagnet). Before C-Mod was finally decommissioned, its magnetic fields, 160,000 times stronger than Earth’s, set the world record for the highest plasma pressure in a tokamak.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Ohm’s law describes, however, metals like copper have internal resistance, so it could run for only four seconds before overheating—and needed more energy to ignite its fusion reactions than what came out of it. Like the now 160 similar tokamaks around the world, C-Mod was an interesting science experiment but mainly reinforced the joke that fusion energy was 20 years away and always would be.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each year, Whyte had challenged PhD students in his fusion design classes to conjure something just as compact as C-Mod, one-800th the scale of ITER, that could achieve and sustain fusion—with an energy gain. But in 2013, as he neared 50, he increasingly had doubts. He’d devoted his career to the fusion dream, but unless something radically changed, he feared it wouldn’t happen in his lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US Department of Energy decided to scale back on fusion. It informed MIT that funding for Alcator C-Mod would end in 2016. So Whyte decided he would either quit fusion and do something else or try something different to get there faster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a new generation of ceramic “high-temperature” superconductors, not available when ITER’s huge magnets were being wrapped in metallic superconducting cable, which has to be chilled to 4 kelvin above absolute zero (–452.47&amp;nbsp;°F) for its resistance to current to fall to zero. Discovered accidentally in 1986 in a Swiss lab, the new ceramic superconductors still needed to be cooled to 20 K (–423.7&amp;nbsp;°F). But with far smaller power requirements, their output was so much greater that a year later the discoverers won a Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The potential applications were limitless, but because ceramic is so brittle, coiling it around electromagnets wasn’t feasible. Then one day Whyte ran into research scientist Leslie Bromberg ’73, PhD ’77, in the hallway holding a fistful of what resembled unspooled tape from a VCR cassette. “What’s all that?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Superconducting tape, new stuff.” The filmy strips were coated with ceramic crystals of rare-earth barium copper oxide. “It’s called ReBCO,” Bromberg said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ReBCO’s rare-earth component, yttrium, is 400 times more common than silver. Could superconducting tape, Whyte immediately wondered, be wound like copper wire to make much smaller but far more powerful magnets?&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The class met in a windowless room in a former Nabisco cracker factory, surrounded by blackboards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He assigned his 2013 fusion design class to see. If the students managed to double the strength of a magnetic field surrounding hot plasma, he knew, they might multiply fusion’s power density sixteenfold. They came up with an eye-­opening design they called Vulcan. It yielded five peer-reviewed papers—but whether layers of wound ReBCO tape could stand the stress of the current needed to hold plasma suspended while being superheated to ignite a fusion reaction was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For two years, his classes refined Vulcan. By 2015, with ReBCO more consistent in quality and supply, he challenged his students—11 male and one female, including an Argentine, a Russian, and a Korean—to outdo what 35 nations had been attempting for nearly 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Let’s see if ReBCO lets us build a 500-megawatt tokamak—the same as ITER, only way smaller.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If superconducting tape could let them make a fusion reactor to fit the footprint of a decommissioned coal-fired plant, he told them, it could plug right into existing power lines. To then make enough carbon-­free energy to stop pushing Earth’s climate past the edge, its components would have to be mass-­producible, so any competent contractor could assemble and service them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The class met in a windowless room in a former Nabisco cracker factory, surrounded by blackboards. Divided into teams, the students set about figuring out how thin-tape electromagnets could be made robust, and how to capture neutrons expelled from fusion reactions so their heat could be used for turning a turbine—and so they could be harnessed to breed more tritium for the plasma. That’s crucial, because natural tritium is exceedingly rare. Since ReBCO-wrapped magnets would be so much smaller, shrinking the dimensions of one component rippled through everything else. One team’s innovations fed another’s, and parts of the design started to link together. As excitement spread through PSFC, members of earlier classes, now postdocs or faculty members, pitched in. Whyte’s students, some with doctoral dissertations due, were putting in 50-hour weeks on this, reminding him of why he’d dreamed of fusion in first place.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whyte looked it over for the thousandth time. He was pretty sure they hadn’t broken any laws of physics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And then, at the semester’s end, out popped their design. Just over 10 feet in diameter, it actually looked like a prototype power plant. While ITER had massive shielding, their tokamak would be wrapped in a compact blanket containing a molten-salt mixture of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride to absorb the heat of the neutrons escaping from the fusion reaction. Those neutrons would also react with the lithium to breed more tritium.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The blanket’s heat would be tapped for electricity—except one-fifth of the heat energy would remain in the plasma, meaning the reaction was now heating itself and was self-sustaining, producing more energy than was needed to ignite it. Net fusion energy had been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ReBCO magnets, although just a 40th the size of ITER’s, could deliver a magnetic field strength of 23 tesla (a hospital MRI machine typically operates at 1.5 tesla). That was more than enough to achieve a fusion reaction, yet it would require less electricity than its copper-clad C-Mod predecessor by a factor of 2,000. Everything was designed for easy maintenance, and parts could be replaced without having to dismantle the entire reactor.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Most important, the calculated energy output was more than 13 times the input.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whyte looked it over for the thousandth time. He was pretty sure they hadn’t broken any laws of physics. He calculated the cost per watt and was astonished. Suddenly their goal wasn’t just building a much smaller ITER. It was being commercially competitive.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Stunned, he told his wife, “This can actually work.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They called it ARC, for “affordable, robust, compact.” “Buildable in a decade,” Whyte predicted&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;The peer-reviewed article his 12 students published in &lt;em&gt;FusionEngineering and Design &lt;/em&gt;estimated it would cost around $5 billion. In 2015, that wasn’t much more than the cost of a comparably sized coal-fired plant, and one-eighth ITER’s price tag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That May, Whyte gave a keynote about ARC at a fusion engineering symposium in Austin, Texas. Four of his students attended. When he described their plan for a workable reactor by 2025, in just 10 years, conferees were astounded—everyone else was talking decades. Afterward, the MIT contingent went to lunch at Stubb’s Bar-B-Q. It was clear that with the climate eroding and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warning that yet-­uninvented technologies were needed to keep temperatures from soaring into dreaded realms, they had to do this. But since the DOE had pulled its funding, how could they?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On a napkin, Whyte started listing what they’d need to do and what each step might cost. Over ribs, they crafted a proposal to spin off a startup to raise venture capital to finance a SPARC (for “soon-as-possible ARC”) demo fusion reactor to show that this could really happen. Then they’d build a commercial-scale ARC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="group photo of team standing in the warehouse in front of the reactor" class="wp-image-1130439" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MIT_Fusion-Magnets-04-PRESS.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In 2021, teams from MIT’s Plasma Science Fusion Center and MIT spinout Commonwealth Fusion Systems used just 30 watts of energy to produce a magnetic field strong enough to sustain a fusion reaction.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GRETCHEN ERTL&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Forming a company would free them from academic and government funding cycles, but they were plasma physicists, most still in their 20s, without business backgrounds. Nevertheless, Whyte and Martin Greenwald, deputy director of the PSFC, agreed to join them, and in 2018 Commonwealth Fusion Systems, CFS, was born. Three of his former students would run the company, and three would remain at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, which—in a profit-sharing agreement—would be CFS’s research arm.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They opened shop up the street, in The Engine, MIT’s “tough tech” startup incubator, and gained the attention of climate-concerned backers like Bill Gates, George Soros, and Jeff Bezos. But they weren’t the only ones competing for fusion funds, and it became a race to see who could make commercial-scale fusion first.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The CFS team may have been young, but because of its partnership with MIT and its more than a hundred experienced fusion scientists, it had a running start.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the end of 2021, Commonwealth Fusion Systems had raised more than $2&amp;nbsp;billion and was breaking ground on 47 acres outside Boston for a commercial fusion energy campus, to build SPARC by 2025—and commercial-scale, mass-­producible ARC by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gaining and actually sustaining net energy is perpetually called fusion’s yet-unreached “holy grail,” but by September 2021, the CFS team of CEO Bob Mumgaard, SM ’15, PhD ’15 (a coauthor of the Vulcan design), chief science officer Brandon Sorbom, PhD ’17 (lead author of the 2015 fusion design class’s breakthrough paper), Whyte, and their 200 CFS colleagues were confident they could do it—if their magnets held. For three years, straight through the pandemic, they’d worked in PSFC’s West Cell laboratory, the cavernous former Oreo factory that had housed Alcator C-Mod, furiously solving problems like how to solder thin-film ReBCO tape together into a structure strong enough to withstand 40,000 amps passing through it—enough to power a small town.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The completed SPARC would have 18 magnets encircling its plasma chamber, but for this test they’d built just one. It was composed of 16 layers, each a D-shaped, 10-foot-high steel disk grooved like an LP. On one side, the grooves held tight spirals of ReBCO film, 270 kilometers in all—the distance from Boston to Albany. “Yet all that ReBCO holds just a sprinkling of rare earth,” said Sorbom. “That’s the magic of superconductors: A tiny bit of material can carry so much current. By comparison, a wind turbine’s rare-earth neodymium magnets weigh tons.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On each disk’s flip side, the grooves channeled liquid helium to cool the superconductor for zero resistance. (The design dates to history’s first high-field magnet, built at MIT in the 1930s, which used copper conductors and water for coolant.) Each layer was built on an automated assembly line. “The idea,” said Mumgaard, “is to make 100,000 magnets a year someday. This can’t be a scientific curiosity. This needs to be an energy source.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although covid-19 had waned, an outbreak could foil everything, so they maintained coronavirus protocols, moving computer terminals outside beneath a tent to avoid crowding within. Others worked virtually. For a month, dozens worked eight-hour, continuous shifts. Some operated the electromagnetic coil, encased in stainless steel in the middle of the room, which over a week had to be gradually supercooled from room temperature of 298 K down to 20 K before slowly ramping up to full magnetic strength. Others constantly compared real-time data with redundant models. As the temperature dropped, the internal connections, welds, and valves contracted at different rates, so they watched for leaks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On September 2, 2021, the Thursday before Labor Day, they started ramping up by a few kiloamps, stopping frequently to check what the current was revealing, how the cooling characteristics had changed, and how the stresses on the ReBCO coil increased as the magnetic field strengthened to record heights.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two nights later, they cranked the amperage toward their goal: a 20-tesla magnetic field, powerful enough to lift 421 Boeing 747s or contain a continuous fusion reaction. They’d been aiming for 7:00 a.m. on Sunday, the 5th. At 3:30, the large screen in the design center showed that they’d reached 40 kiloamps, and the magnetic field had reached 19.56 tesla.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At 4:30 a.m., they were at 19.98 tesla. Things got very quiet. At 5:20 a.m., every redundant on-screen meter read 20 tesla, and nothing had leaked or exploded—except under the tent, where champagne corks were popping.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Five years earlier, on its final four-­second run, C-Mod’s copper-conducting magnet had consumed 200 million watts of energy to reach 5.7 tesla. This took 30 watts—less energy by a factor of around 10 million, Whyte told reporters—to produce a magnetic field strong enough to sustain a fusion reaction. The joints that transferred current from one layer to the next actually performed better than expected. That was the biggest unknown, because there was only one way to test them: in the magnet itself. They looked spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130437" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cover.jpg?w=1000" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After five hours, the team ramped down the power. “It’s a Kitty Hawk moment,” Mumgaard said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adapted from &lt;/em&gt;Hope Dies Last: Visionary People Across the World, Fighting to Find Us a Future&lt;em&gt; by Alan Weisman, published by Dutton, an imprint of Penguin Random House. © 2025 by Alan Weisman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/06/1128665/dennis-whytes-fusion-quest/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Starstruck (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/06/1128661/starstruck/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Few people, if any, contemplate stars—celestial or cinematic—the way Aomawa Shields does.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An astronomer and astrobiologist, Shields explores the potential habitability of planets beyond our solar system. But she is also a classically trained actor—and that’s helped shape her professional trajectory in unexpected ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, Shields is an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine, where she oversees a research team that uses computer models to explore conditions on exoplanets, or planets that revolve around stars other than the sun. But while searching for life many light-years away is her day job, creative endeavors round out her purpose on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2023 Shields published a memoir, &lt;em&gt;Life on Other Planets: A Memoir of Finding My Place in the Universe&lt;/em&gt;. She has started an influential educational program that encourages young girls to explore space, given a hugely popular TED Talk about how we’ll find life on other planets, and won a string of prestigious academic awards, honors, and grants. She also plays the violin, cooks, practices yoga, and is a mom. And as what she calls a “rest leader”—a professional proponent of slowing down—Shields has somehow managed the seemingly impossible: She makes time.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Her unorthodox path began on the screen, in the realm of make-believe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I wanted to become an astronaut. That dream started very early in my life, at the age of 12, after seeing a movie that dramatized kids getting launched into space,” she says, referring to &lt;em&gt;SpaceCamp&lt;/em&gt;, an ’80s kids’ comedy about an accidental space shuttle flight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The next bit of cinematic inspiration cemented her interest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Charlotte Blackwood was an astrophysicist, and she was very glamorous, too,” Shields says, smiling at how she was captivated by the heroine in &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt;. “There’s an iconic scene where she’s walking down the aisle between Tom Cruise and other pilot trainees, and she just kind of whips off her glasses and just looks like such a badass.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A high-achieving student while growing up in California, Canada, and Massachusetts, Shields made her way to Phillips Exeter Academy, in large part drawn by its state-of-the-art astronomical observatory. Once there, she got pulled into acting in a serious way. “Enter a new dream,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Throughout high school her astronomy and acting aspirations “kind of danced beside each other,” Shields remembers. “But I held firm to the first one and went to MIT because I understood that it’s the best science school in the country. I learned that at the age of 12—that’s where I’m going to go.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At MIT, Shields struggled academically at first and took refuge in the creative arts. She was chosen to participate in the Burchard Scholars Program, whose monthly dinner seminars bring faculty members together with students who excel in the arts, social sciences, and humanities. She sang in the a&amp;nbsp;cappella group the Muses and performed in lots of plays. At the end of her senior year, she found herself wondering: “Do I go to grad school in acting or astronomy?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The latter won out, but not for long. Shields headed to a graduate program in astronomy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “During that year, I had a white male professor tell me to consider other career options, and that was hard to hear,” she says. She remembers thinking, “I’m going to the other dream because clearly someone’s telling me that I don’t belong here. Maybe they’re right.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So she applied to UCLA, where she got an MFA in acting, leaving astronomy for more than a decade. But then, when Shields was working odd jobs to supplement her acting gigs, a mentor from her undergraduate years encouraged her to look on a Caltech-operated job website. She saw an opening for a help desk operator at the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that is particularly adept at viewing the formation of young stars—and it only required a bachelor’s degree. “I’d refer the harder questions to the PhDs,” she says. “But by taking that job, I got to go to astronomy talks again … This field of exoplanets had just exploded during the time I’d been away.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shields had some success in acting, including a part in a film called &lt;em&gt;Nine Lives&lt;/em&gt;, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. But a big break—and then heartbreak—came after she was cast as the host of the show &lt;em&gt;Wired Science&lt;/em&gt;, only to lose the job when the producers decided to change presenters. It was a “devastating moment,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Soon after, she emailed the astrophysicist and science communications luminary Neil deGrasse Tyson, whom she’d been introduced to over email by an astronomer working with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and relayed what had happened. He replied that he’d seen her in the pilot and told her that “without a PhD you don’t have that street cred if you want to do science television,” she recalls. Meanwhile, she had applied to NASA’s astronaut candidate program but didn’t make it past the first level. (She did, however, get to play an astronaut in a recent Toyota ad.) “There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD,” she says. So she did, earning her doctorate in astronomy and astrobiology in 2014 from the University of Washington.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astrobiology, Shields explains, is a relatively new field that studies the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe: “It’s about how life got started on Earth.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astrobiologists might focus on the habitability of planets, or on methods for exploring life on other planets, or on liquids other than water that could support life. It’s a highly interdisciplinary field. “There are astronomers that are looking for these planets and are using their particular field of expertise to answer that question: Are we alone?” Shields explains. Some of them are “also chemists and biologists and oceanographers and geologists who tackle these questions from their own lens and specific area of expertise,” she says. “That’s why I love it. As an astrobiologist, we don’t have to get 15 PhDs. We get to collaborate with people in different departments who lend their own expertise … on those science questions.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shields is trying to answer a question sparked by the night sky—one that’s deeply personal yet universal in both the astronomical and the colloquial sense. “Ever since I was a little girl, I would look up at the sky and wonder what was out there,” she says. “It comes from a sense of wonder for me. I still have that feeling when I look up at the night sky and I see these little pinpoints of light. I wonder: Is there anyone looking back at me? … How far does space go?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are, she explains, 100 billion stars in our galaxy, most orbited by at least one planet, and over 100 billion galaxies beyond ours. That’s about 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; stars in the universe. The likelihood that only Earth was able to produce life “I think is pretty low,” Shields says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’m looking for planetary environments that could be conducive to life beyond Earth,” she says. “And my team does that largely using climate models. These are the same kinds of models that can predict climate and weather on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shields plugs information gathered by observational astronomers into such models, along with different potential combinations of other, unknown variables—like the type of light a planet receives from its host star, the composition of its atmosphere and surface, and certain orbital information. “There’s only so much that you can really tell about a planet from the telescope information that you get,” she explains. “We can explore that parameter space with climate models and say: Okay, if it has this surface composition, this is what the temperature would be like on this planet. If it has this atmospheric composition, this type of orbit, this is what the climate would be like, and this is how habitable it would be across its surface.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered 6,000 exoplanets. Shields says those in Earth’s size range—in which she’s most interested—number in the hundreds. A smaller subset of those are orbiting in what’s called the “habitable zone” of their star, creating warm enough conditions to maintain water in liquid form—the key to life. So far, as many as 100 or so planets that fall into that category have been identified, but the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, could find even more potentially habitable planets by detecting “biosignatures” suggesting a biological presence, such as particular gases in their atmospheres or glints that might be reflections of water on the planetary surface.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Being able to detect more of these sorts of signals, Shields says, is the next “big mission” in astronomy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Shields on the TED stage" class="wp-image-1130454" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2025-10-22-at-10.38.48-AM.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Shields’s hugely popular TED Talk, “How we’ll find life on other planets,” has nearly 2 million views.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;TED CONFERENCES, VIA YOUTUBE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, in her academic work, her mind hurtles to the farthest reaches of the universe. But in her precious hours outside of academia, she has learned to be still. When her work schedule started to overwhelm her, Shields’s health began to suffer. Then she discovered the practice of yoga nidra—an ancient form of meditation in which practitioners are guided into a deeply restful “yogic sleep.” Shields read the book &lt;em&gt;Do Less: A Revolutionary Approach to Time and Energy Management for Ambitious Women&lt;/em&gt;, which claims that 20 or 30 minutes of yoga nidra “feels like three hours of sleep in your body,” she says. “And as the mother of a young child, I was like: Okay, sign me up!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Last year she trained with Karen Brody, author of &lt;em&gt;Daring to Rest:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Reclaim Your Power with Yoga Nidra Rest Meditation&lt;/em&gt;, and became a certified facilitator. “It’s been important to me to share it broadly and to really try to do my part to introduce the culture of academia, in particular, to this notion of resting as a daily practice,” she says. Now she’s at work on a book about her attempt to moderate—to resist the temptation to take on too much. She has learned to decline invitations and put firm boundaries between her work and personal life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shields has realized that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Combining them makes her a more effective educator.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On a weekday in August, an ayurvedic soup simmers on her kitchen stove. A music stand occupies the corner of a room where she sometimes picks up her violin and plays fiddle tunes. (Her parents, both professional musicians, derived her name from a chant of vowel sounds they made up.) She mentions the poem “swim | women of color”by Nayyirah Waheed and recites it in a soft, rich voice. Part of it goes: “&lt;em&gt;This structure counts on your inability to say no. mean no. they take no from our first breath. go back and return it to your mouth. your heart. your light&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I need to graciously let go or say no—make room for someone else to say yes,” Shields says. “That allows me to have more spaciousness in my schedule, because one thing I’ve discovered is that women of color, as we proceed up the academic ladder, the requests just exponentially increase, and so saying no is not simply an important skill—it’s a survival skill.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Along the way, Shields has come to realize that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. In fact, combining them—and sharing her passion for both—makes her a more effective educator. Her training as an actor helps her craft lectures that keep students engaged and animates her presentations, including her TED Talk, in a way that resonates with nonscientists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Shields stands next to a child who is holding an open notebook above their head" class="wp-image-1130453" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Resized_IMG_1374.jpg?w=901" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Shields launched Rising Stargirls, which integrates writing, visual art, and theater exercises into astronomy workshops, to encourage middle-school girls to bring their whole selves to learning about the universe.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RISING STARGIRLS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shields is also tapping into her love of acting to inspire the next generation of scientists who will help answer astronomy’s big questions. As part of a postdoctoral fellowship through the National Science Foundation, she was asked to design an educational outreach component. “I was like: Is there a scenario in which I could use acting to teach astronomy?” she says. “And I looked it up. There was precedent for that. Astronomy education journals had shown that when you involve girls in creative arts—theater, writing—and you incorporate that into astronomy education, you increase girls’ confidence in both asking and answering questions.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The finding resonated with her own experience. After all, it was acting—which she turned to when her professor discouraged her from studying astronomy—that gave her the confidence to pursue astronomy again. “I looked at acting as this outlet, this safe space,” she says. “Nobody could tell me that I was wrong as an actor.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;With that in mind, Shields launched Rising Stargirls, which holds workshops using the creative arts to teach astronomy to ­middle-school-aged girls of all backgrounds. She and her colleagues have since published a study showing that girls who attended the program reported being more excited to take science classes and were more likely to believe they could do well in science. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We want them to know that who they are is inherently pivotal and critical to their study and practice of astronomy,” Shields says. “The sciences are incredibly creative, and they get to bring that creative imagination and creative inspiration they find through the arts into learning about the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That same exchange has played out in Shields’s life, but it’s only recently that she’s come to see similarities between her roles as an astronomer and an actor. “They’re both about story,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Actors have to convey the arc or evolution of a story through the lives of their characters. “Stars, ­planets—they have lives, too,” Shields says. “They have births, they have evolution, and they die. It’s my job as a scientist to unveil the story—to discover the story of whether there’s life elsewhere.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Few people, if any, contemplate stars—celestial or cinematic—the way Aomawa Shields does.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An astronomer and astrobiologist, Shields explores the potential habitability of planets beyond our solar system. But she is also a classically trained actor—and that’s helped shape her professional trajectory in unexpected ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, Shields is an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine, where she oversees a research team that uses computer models to explore conditions on exoplanets, or planets that revolve around stars other than the sun. But while searching for life many light-years away is her day job, creative endeavors round out her purpose on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2023 Shields published a memoir, &lt;em&gt;Life on Other Planets: A Memoir of Finding My Place in the Universe&lt;/em&gt;. She has started an influential educational program that encourages young girls to explore space, given a hugely popular TED Talk about how we’ll find life on other planets, and won a string of prestigious academic awards, honors, and grants. She also plays the violin, cooks, practices yoga, and is a mom. And as what she calls a “rest leader”—a professional proponent of slowing down—Shields has somehow managed the seemingly impossible: She makes time.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Her unorthodox path began on the screen, in the realm of make-believe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I wanted to become an astronaut. That dream started very early in my life, at the age of 12, after seeing a movie that dramatized kids getting launched into space,” she says, referring to &lt;em&gt;SpaceCamp&lt;/em&gt;, an ’80s kids’ comedy about an accidental space shuttle flight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The next bit of cinematic inspiration cemented her interest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Charlotte Blackwood was an astrophysicist, and she was very glamorous, too,” Shields says, smiling at how she was captivated by the heroine in &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt;. “There’s an iconic scene where she’s walking down the aisle between Tom Cruise and other pilot trainees, and she just kind of whips off her glasses and just looks like such a badass.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A high-achieving student while growing up in California, Canada, and Massachusetts, Shields made her way to Phillips Exeter Academy, in large part drawn by its state-of-the-art astronomical observatory. Once there, she got pulled into acting in a serious way. “Enter a new dream,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Throughout high school her astronomy and acting aspirations “kind of danced beside each other,” Shields remembers. “But I held firm to the first one and went to MIT because I understood that it’s the best science school in the country. I learned that at the age of 12—that’s where I’m going to go.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At MIT, Shields struggled academically at first and took refuge in the creative arts. She was chosen to participate in the Burchard Scholars Program, whose monthly dinner seminars bring faculty members together with students who excel in the arts, social sciences, and humanities. She sang in the a&amp;nbsp;cappella group the Muses and performed in lots of plays. At the end of her senior year, she found herself wondering: “Do I go to grad school in acting or astronomy?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The latter won out, but not for long. Shields headed to a graduate program in astronomy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “During that year, I had a white male professor tell me to consider other career options, and that was hard to hear,” she says. She remembers thinking, “I’m going to the other dream because clearly someone’s telling me that I don’t belong here. Maybe they’re right.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So she applied to UCLA, where she got an MFA in acting, leaving astronomy for more than a decade. But then, when Shields was working odd jobs to supplement her acting gigs, a mentor from her undergraduate years encouraged her to look on a Caltech-operated job website. She saw an opening for a help desk operator at the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that is particularly adept at viewing the formation of young stars—and it only required a bachelor’s degree. “I’d refer the harder questions to the PhDs,” she says. “But by taking that job, I got to go to astronomy talks again … This field of exoplanets had just exploded during the time I’d been away.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shields had some success in acting, including a part in a film called &lt;em&gt;Nine Lives&lt;/em&gt;, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. But a big break—and then heartbreak—came after she was cast as the host of the show &lt;em&gt;Wired Science&lt;/em&gt;, only to lose the job when the producers decided to change presenters. It was a “devastating moment,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Soon after, she emailed the astrophysicist and science communications luminary Neil deGrasse Tyson, whom she’d been introduced to over email by an astronomer working with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and relayed what had happened. He replied that he’d seen her in the pilot and told her that “without a PhD you don’t have that street cred if you want to do science television,” she recalls. Meanwhile, she had applied to NASA’s astronaut candidate program but didn’t make it past the first level. (She did, however, get to play an astronaut in a recent Toyota ad.) “There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD,” she says. So she did, earning her doctorate in astronomy and astrobiology in 2014 from the University of Washington.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astrobiology, Shields explains, is a relatively new field that studies the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe: “It’s about how life got started on Earth.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astrobiologists might focus on the habitability of planets, or on methods for exploring life on other planets, or on liquids other than water that could support life. It’s a highly interdisciplinary field. “There are astronomers that are looking for these planets and are using their particular field of expertise to answer that question: Are we alone?” Shields explains. Some of them are “also chemists and biologists and oceanographers and geologists who tackle these questions from their own lens and specific area of expertise,” she says. “That’s why I love it. As an astrobiologist, we don’t have to get 15 PhDs. We get to collaborate with people in different departments who lend their own expertise … on those science questions.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shields is trying to answer a question sparked by the night sky—one that’s deeply personal yet universal in both the astronomical and the colloquial sense. “Ever since I was a little girl, I would look up at the sky and wonder what was out there,” she says. “It comes from a sense of wonder for me. I still have that feeling when I look up at the night sky and I see these little pinpoints of light. I wonder: Is there anyone looking back at me? … How far does space go?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are, she explains, 100 billion stars in our galaxy, most orbited by at least one planet, and over 100 billion galaxies beyond ours. That’s about 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; stars in the universe. The likelihood that only Earth was able to produce life “I think is pretty low,” Shields says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’m looking for planetary environments that could be conducive to life beyond Earth,” she says. “And my team does that largely using climate models. These are the same kinds of models that can predict climate and weather on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shields plugs information gathered by observational astronomers into such models, along with different potential combinations of other, unknown variables—like the type of light a planet receives from its host star, the composition of its atmosphere and surface, and certain orbital information. “There’s only so much that you can really tell about a planet from the telescope information that you get,” she explains. “We can explore that parameter space with climate models and say: Okay, if it has this surface composition, this is what the temperature would be like on this planet.

And everyone in the neighborhood was given disinfectant tablets for the toilet and encouraged to keep flushing to a minimum. I didn’t understand exactly what was happening. But I saw that everyone in the community was affected by the scarcity of this resource.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities around the world, Wang is leading MIT’s effort to tackle the interlinked challenges of a changing climate and a burgeoning global demand for energy. Last April, after wrapping up a two-year stint directing the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E), she returned to the campus where she’d been both an undergraduate and a faculty member to become the inaugural vice president for energy and climate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The accelerating problem of climate change and its countless impacts represent the greatest scientific, technical, and policy challenge of this or any age,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a January 2025 letter to the MIT community announcing the appointment. “We are tremendously fortunate that Evelyn Wang has agreed to lead this crucial work.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A time to lead&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MIT has studied and worked on problems of climate and energy for decades. In recent years, with temperatures rising, storms strengthening, and energy demands surging, that work has expanded and intensified, spawning myriad research projects, policy proposals, papers, and startups. The challenges are so urgent that MIT launched several Institute-wide initiatives, including President Rafael Reif’s Climate Grand Challenges (2020) and President Kornbluth’s Climate Project (2024).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But Kornbluth has argued that MIT needs to do even more. Her creation of the new VP-level post that Wang now holds underscores that commitment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang is well suited for the role. The Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT and former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, she joined the faculty in 2007, shortly after she completed her PhD at Stanford University. Her research centers on thermal management and energy conversion and storage, but she also works on nano-engineered surfaces and materials, as well as water harvesting and purification. Wang and her colleagues have produced a device based on nanophotonic crystals that could double the efficiency of solar cells—one of &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017. And the device she invented with Nobel laureate Omar Yaghi for extracting water from very dry air was named one of 2017’s top 10 emerging technologies by &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; and the World Economic Forum, and in 2018 earned her the Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water. (See story on this water harvesting research in the January/February issue of &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Wang has a deep knowledge of the Institute—and even deeper roots here. (See “Family Ties,” &lt;em&gt;MIT Alumni News&lt;/em&gt;, March/April 2015.) Her parents met at MIT as PhD students from Taiwan in the 1960s; they were married in the MIT chapel. When Wang arrived at MIT in 1996 as a first-year student, her brother Alex ’96, MEng ’97, had just graduated and was working on a master’s degree in electrical engineering. Her other brother, Ben, would earn his PhD at MIT in 2007. She even met her husband, Russell Sammon ’98, at MIT. Apart from her time at ARPA-E, a very brief stint at Bell Labs, and sabbatical work at Google, she has spent her entire professional career at the Institute. So she has a rare perspective on the resources MIT can draw on to respond to the climate and energy challenge.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The beating heart of MIT is innovation,” she says. “We are innovators. And innovation is something that will help us leapfrog some of the potential hurdles as we work toward climate and energy solutions. Our ability to innovate can enable us to move closer toward energy security, toward sustainable resource development and use.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The prevailing innovative mindset at MIT is backed by a deep desire to tackle the problem.Many people on campus are passionate about climate and energy, says Wang. “That is why President Kornbluth made this her flagship initiative. We are fortunate to have so many talented students and faculty, and to be able to rely on our infrastructure. I know they will all step up to meet the challenges.” But she is quick to point out that the problems are too large for any one entity—including MIT—to address on its own. So she’s aiming to encourage more collaboration both among MIT researchers and with other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If we want to solve this problem of climate change, if we want to change the trajectory in the next decade, we cannot continue to do business as usual,” she says. “That is what is most exciting about this problem and, frankly, is why I came back to campus to take this job.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Hand in hand&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The coupling of climate and energy in Wang’s portfolio is strategic. “Energy and climate are two sides of the same coin,” she explains. “A major reason we are seeing climate change is that we haven’t deployed solutions at a scale necessary to mitigate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from the energy sector. The ways we generate energy and manage emissions are fundamental to any strategy addressing climate change. At the same time, the world demands more and more energy—a demand we can’t possibly meet through a single means.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Zero-emissions and low-carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate … We need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s more, she contends that switching from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, while fundamental, is only part of the solution. “Zero-emissions and low-­carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate,” she says. “We need to consider the environmental impacts of these new fuels we develop and deploy. We need to use data analysis to move goods and energy more efficiently and intelligently. We need to consider raising more of our food in water and using food by-products and waste to help sequester carbon. In short, we need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That challenge seems destined to grow more daunting in the coming years. There are still, Wang observes, areas of “energy poverty”—places where people cannot access sufficient energy to sustain their well-being. But solving that problem will only drive up energy production and consumption worldwide. The explosive growth of AI will likely do the same, since the huge data centers that power the technology require enormous quantities of energy for both computation and cooling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang believes that while AI will continue to drive electricity demand, it can also contribute to creating a more sustainable future.“We can use AI to develop climate and energy solutions,” she says. “AI can play a primary role in solution sets, can give us new and improved ways to manage intermittent loads in the energy grid. It can help us develop new catalysts and chemicals or help us stabilize the plasma we’ll use in nuclear fusion. It could augment climate and geospatial modeling that would allow us to predict the impact of potential climate solutions before we implement them. We could even use AI to reduce computational needs and thereby ease cooling demand.”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Change the narrative, change the culture &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MIT was humming with climate and energy research long before Wang returned to campus in 2025 after wrapping up her work at ARPA-E. Almost 400 researchers across 90% of MIT’s departments responded to President Reif’s 2020 Climate Grand Challenges initiative. The Institute awarded $2.7 million to 27 finalist teams and identified five flagship projects, including one to create an early warning system to help mitigate the impact of climate disasters, another to predict and prepare for extreme weather events, and an ambitious project to slash nearly half of all industrial carbon emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;About 250 MIT faculty and senior researchers are now involved in the Climate Project at MIT, a campus-wide initiative launched in 2024 that works to generate and implement climate solutions, tools, and policy proposals. Conceived to bolster MIT’s already significant efforts as a leading source of technological, behavioral, and policy solutions to global climate issues, the Climate Project has identified six “missions”: decarbonizing energy and industry; preserving the atmosphere, land, and oceans; empowering frontline community action; designing resilient and prosperous cities; enabling new policy approaches; and wild cards, a catch-all category that supports development of unconventional solutions outside the scope of the other missions. Faculty members direct each mission.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With so much climate research already underway,a large part of Wang’s new role is to support and deepen existing projects. But to fully tap into MIT’s unique capabilities, she says, she’s aiming to foster some cultural shifts. And that begins with identifying ways to facilitate cooperation—both across the Institute and with external partners—on a scale that can make “something truly transformational” happen, she says. “At this stage, with the challenges we face in energy and climate, we need to do something ambitious.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129150" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MIT-Solar-Thermal-1-Press.jpg?w=1708" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This solar thermophotovoltaic device Wang’s lab developed with Marin Soljačić converts solar heat that’s usually wasted into usable light, potentially doubling the efficiency of typical solar cells.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE RESEARCHERS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129149" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MIT-Heat-Collection-01-PRESS.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wang’s group worked with Gang Chen’s lab to develop this highly transparent insulating silica aerogel.

And traditionally we’ve done that well, often with outstanding results. But climate and energy are systems problems, which means we need to create a systems solution. How do we bring these diverse faculty together? How do we align their efforts, not just in technology, but also in policy, science, finance, and social sciences?” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To encourage MIT faculty to collaborate across departments, schools, and disciplines, Wang recently announced that the MIT Climate Project would award grants of $50,000 to $250,000 to collaborative faculty teams that work on six- to 24-month climate research projects. Student teams are invited to apply for research grants of up to $15,000.“We can’t afford to work in silos,” she says. “People from wildly diverse fields are working on the same problems and speaking different professional languages. We need to bring people together in an integrative way so we can attack the problem holistically.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang also wants colleagues to reach beyond campus. MIT, she says, needs to form real, defined partnerships with other universities, as well as with industries, investors, and philanthropists. “This isn’t just an MIT problem,” she says. “Individual efforts and 1,000 flowers alone will not be enough to meet these challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thinking holistically—and in terms of systems—will help focus efforts on the areas that will have the greatest impact. At a Climate Project presentation in October, Wang outlined an approach that would focus on building well-being within communities. This will begin with efforts to empower communities by developing coastal resilience, to decarbonize ports and shipping, and to design and build data centers that integrate smoothly and sustainably with nearby communities. She encouraged her colleagues to think in terms of big-picture solutions for the future and then to work on the components needed to build that future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“As researchers, we sometimes jump to a solution before we have fully defined the problem,” she explains. “Let’s take the problem of decarbonization in transportation. The solution we’ve come up with is to electrify our vehicles. When we run up against the problem of the range of these vehicles, our first thought is to create higher-density batteries. But the real problem we’re facing isn’t about batteries. It’s about increasing the range of these vehicles. And the solution to that problem isn’t necessarily a more powerful battery.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom … The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang is confident that her MIT colleagues have both the capacity and the desire to embrace the holistic approach she envisions. “When I was accepted to MIT as an undergraduate and visited the campus, the thing that made me certain I wanted to enroll here was the people,” she recalls. “They weren’t just talented. They had so many different interests. They were passionate about solving big problems. And they were eager to learn from one another. That spirit hasn’t changed. And that’s the spirit I and my team can tap into.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang believes MIT and other institutions working on climate and energy solutions also need to change how we talk about the challenge. “Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom,” she says. “The underlying issue here is our well-being. That’s what we care about, not the climate. The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing? How can we create conditions of resilience, sustainability, and prosperity? That is the framework I would like us to build on.” For example, in areas where extreme weather threatens homes or rising temperatures are harming human health, we should be developing affordable technologies that make dwellings more resilient and keep people cooler.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Wang’s colleagues at MIT concur with her assessment of the mission ahead. They also have a deep respect for her scholarship and leadership. “I couldn’t think of a better person to represent MIT’s diverse and powerful ability to attack climate,” says Susan Solomon, the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies at MIT and recipient of the US National Medal of Science for her work on the Antarctic ozone hole. “Communicating MIT’s capabilities to provide what the nation needs—not only in engineering but also in … economics, the physical, chemical, and biological sciences, and much more—is an immense challenge.” But she’s confident that Wang will do it justice. “Evelyn is a consummate storyteller,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“She’s tremendously quick at learning new fields and driving toward what the real nuggets are that need to be addressed in solving hard problems,” says Elsa Olivetti, PhD ’07, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering and director of the MIT Climate Project’s Decarbonizing Energy and Industry mission. “Her direct, meticulous thinking and leadership style mean that she can focus teams within her office to do the work that will be most impactful at scale.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wang’s experience at ARPA-E is expected to be especially useful. “The current geopolitical situation and the limited amount of research funding available relative to the scale of the climate problem pose formidable challenges to bringing MIT’s strengths to bear on the problem,” says Rohit Karnik, director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) and a collaborator with Wang on numerous projects and initiatives since both joined the mechanical engineering faculty in 2007. “Evelyn’s leadership experience at MIT and in government, her ability to take a complex situation and define a clear vision, and her passion to make a difference will serve her well in her new role.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang’s new MIT appointment is seen as a good thing beyond the Institute as well. “A role like this requires a skill set that is difficult to find in one individual,” says Krista Walton, vice chancellor for research and innovation at North Carolina State University. Walton and Wang collaborated on multiple projects, including the DARPA work that produced the device for extracting water from very dry air based on the original prototype Wang co-developed. “You need scientific depth, an understanding of the federal and global landscape, a collaborative instinct and the ability to be a convener, and a strategic vision,” Walton says—and she can’t imagine a better pick for the job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Evelyn has an extraordinary ability to bridge fundamental science with real-world application,” she says. “She approaches collaboration as a true partnership and not as a transaction.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A challenging funding climate&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Climate scientists explore broad swaths of time, tracking trends in temperature, greenhouse gases, volcanic activity, vegetation, and more across hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years. Even average temperatures and precipitation levels are calculated over periods of three decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129148" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MIT_News_10_24_25_36614.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wang and grad students Jan Luka Čas, SM ’25, and Briana Cuero examine a small test device for a hydrogel-based thermal battery they are developing with fellow PhD student Liliosa Cole.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;KEN RICHARDSON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in the realm of politics, change happens much faster, prompting sudden and sometimes startling shifts in culture and policy. The current US administration has proposed widespread budget cuts in climate and energy research. These have included slicing more than $1.5 billion from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), canceling multiple climate-related missions at NASA, and shuttering the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the agency responsible for publishing the National Climate Assessment. The Trump administration submitted a budget request that would cut the National Science Foundation budget from more than $9 billion to just over $4 billion for 2026. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that NSF grant funding for STEM education from January through mid-May 2025 was down 80% from its 10-year average, while NSF grant awards for math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and materials science research were down 67%. In September, the US Department of Energy announced it had terminated 223 projects that “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Among the agencies affected is ARPA-E, the agency Wang directed before returning to MIT. Meanwhile, MIT research programs that rely on government sources of funding will also feel the impact of the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Acknowledging the difficulties she and MIT may face in the present moment, Wang still prefers to look forward. “Of course this is a challenging time,” she says. “There are near-term challenges and long-term challenges. We need to focus on those long-term challenges. As President Kornbluth has said, we need to continue to advocate for research and education. We need to pursue long-term solutions, to follow our convictions in addressing problems in energy and climate. And we need to be ready to seize the opportunities that reside in these long-term challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang also sees openings for short-term collaboration—areas where MIT and the current administration can find common ground and goals. “There is still a huge area of opportunity for us to align our interests with those of this administration,” she says. “We can move the needle forward together on energy, on national security, on minerals, on economic competitiveness. All these are interests we share, and there are pathways we can follow to meet these challenges to our nation together. MIT is a major force in the nuclear space, in both fission and fusion. These, along with geothermal, could provide the power base we need to meet our energy demands. There are significant opportunities for partnerships with this or any administration to unlock some of these innovations and implement them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A moonshot factory&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While she views herself as a researcher and an academic, Wang’s relevant government experience should prove especially useful in her VP role at MIT. In her two years as director of ARPA-E, she coordinated a broad array of the US Department of Energy’s early-stage research and development in energy generation, storage, and use. “I think I had the best job in government,” she says. Designed to operate at arm’s length from the Department of Energy, ARPA-E searches for high-risk, high-reward energy innovation projects. “More than one observer has called ARPA-E a moonshot factory,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seeking out and facilitating “moonshot”-­worthy projects at a national and sometimes global scale gave Wang a broader lens through which to view issues of energy and climate. It also taught her that big ideas do not translate into big solutions automatically. “I learned what it takes to make an impact on energy technology at ARPA-E and I will be forever grateful,” she says. “I saw how game-changing ideas can take a decade to go from concept to deployment. I learned to appreciate the diversity of talent and innovation in the national ecosystem composed of laboratories, startups, and institutions. I saw how that ecosystem could zero in to identify real problems, envision diverse pathways, and create prototypes. And I also saw just how hard that journey is.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"&gt;Climate and energy research at MIT&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT researchers are tackling climate and energy issues from multiple angles, working on everything from decarbonizing energy and industry to designing resilient and prosperous cities. Find out more at&lt;/strong&gt; climateproject.mit.edu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While MIT is already an important element in that ecosystem, Wang and her colleagues want the Institute to play an even more prominent role. “We can be a convener and collaborator, first across all of MIT’s departments, and then with industry, the financial world, and governments,” she says. “We need to do aggressive outreach and find like-minded partners.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Although the problems of climate and climate change are global, the most effective way MIT can address them is locally,” said Wang at the October presentation of the MIT Climate Project. “Working across schools and disciplines, collaborating with external partners, we will develop targeted solutions for individual places and communities—solutions that can then serve as templates for other places and communities.” But she also cautions against one-size-fits-all solutions. “Solar panels, for example, work wonderfully, but only in areas that have sufficient space and sunlight,” she explains. “Institutions like MIT can showcase a diversity of approaches and determine the best approach for each individual context.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most of all, Wang wants her colleagues to be proactive. “Because MIT is a factory of ideas, perhaps even a moonshot factory, we need to think boldly and continue to think boldly so we can make an impact as soon as possible,” she says. She also wants her colleagues to stay hopeful and not feel daunted by a challenge that can at times feel overwhelming. “We will build pilots, one at a time, and demonstrate that these projects are not only possible but practical,” she says. “And that is how we will build a future everyone wants to live in.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Water shortages in Southern California made an indelible impression on Evelyn Wang ’00 when she was growing up in Los Angeles. “I was quite young, perhaps in first grade,” she says. “But I remember we weren’t allowed to turn our sprinklers on. And everyone in the neighborhood was given disinfectant tablets for the toilet and encouraged to keep flushing to a minimum. I didn’t understand exactly what was happening. But I saw that everyone in the community was affected by the scarcity of this resource.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities around the world, Wang is leading MIT’s effort to tackle the interlinked challenges of a changing climate and a burgeoning global demand for energy. Last April, after wrapping up a two-year stint directing the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E), she returned to the campus where she’d been both an undergraduate and a faculty member to become the inaugural vice president for energy and climate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The accelerating problem of climate change and its countless impacts represent the greatest scientific, technical, and policy challenge of this or any age,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a January 2025 letter to the MIT community announcing the appointment. “We are tremendously fortunate that Evelyn Wang has agreed to lead this crucial work.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A time to lead&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MIT has studied and worked on problems of climate and energy for decades. In recent years, with temperatures rising, storms strengthening, and energy demands surging, that work has expanded and intensified, spawning myriad research projects, policy proposals, papers, and startups. The challenges are so urgent that MIT launched several Institute-wide initiatives, including President Rafael Reif’s Climate Grand Challenges (2020) and President Kornbluth’s Climate Project (2024).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But Kornbluth has argued that MIT needs to do even more. Her creation of the new VP-level post that Wang now holds underscores that commitment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang is well suited for the role. The Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT and former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, she joined the faculty in 2007, shortly after she completed her PhD at Stanford University. Her research centers on thermal management and energy conversion and storage, but she also works on nano-engineered surfaces and materials, as well as water harvesting and purification. Wang and her colleagues have produced a device based on nanophotonic crystals that could double the efficiency of solar cells—one of &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017. And the device she invented with Nobel laureate Omar Yaghi for extracting water from very dry air was named one of 2017’s top 10 emerging technologies by &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; and the World Economic Forum, and in 2018 earned her the Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water. (See story on this water harvesting research in the January/February issue of &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Wang has a deep knowledge of the Institute—and even deeper roots here. (See “Family Ties,” &lt;em&gt;MIT Alumni News&lt;/em&gt;, March/April 2015.) Her parents met at MIT as PhD students from Taiwan in the 1960s; they were married in the MIT chapel. When Wang arrived at MIT in 1996 as a first-year student, her brother Alex ’96, MEng ’97, had just graduated and was working on a master’s degree in electrical engineering. Her other brother, Ben, would earn his PhD at MIT in 2007. She even met her husband, Russell Sammon ’98, at MIT. Apart from her time at ARPA-E, a very brief stint at Bell Labs, and sabbatical work at Google, she has spent her entire professional career at the Institute. So she has a rare perspective on the resources MIT can draw on to respond to the climate and energy challenge.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The beating heart of MIT is innovation,” she says. “We are innovators. And innovation is something that will help us leapfrog some of the potential hurdles as we work toward climate and energy solutions. Our ability to innovate can enable us to move closer toward energy security, toward sustainable resource development and use.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The prevailing innovative mindset at MIT is backed by a deep desire to tackle the problem.Many people on campus are passionate about climate and energy, says Wang. “That is why President Kornbluth made this her flagship initiative. We are fortunate to have so many talented students and faculty, and to be able to rely on our infrastructure. I know they will all step up to meet the challenges.” But she is quick to point out that the problems are too large for any one entity—including MIT—to address on its own. So she’s aiming to encourage more collaboration both among MIT researchers and with other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If we want to solve this problem of climate change, if we want to change the trajectory in the next decade, we cannot continue to do business as usual,” she says. “That is what is most exciting about this problem and, frankly, is why I came back to campus to take this job.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Hand in hand&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The coupling of climate and energy in Wang’s portfolio is strategic. “Energy and climate are two sides of the same coin,” she explains. “A major reason we are seeing climate change is that we haven’t deployed solutions at a scale necessary to mitigate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from the energy sector. The ways we generate energy and manage emissions are fundamental to any strategy addressing climate change. At the same time, the world demands more and more energy—a demand we can’t possibly meet through a single means.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Zero-emissions and low-carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate … We need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s more, she contends that switching from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, while fundamental, is only part of the solution. “Zero-emissions and low-­carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate,” she says. “We need to consider the environmental impacts of these new fuels we develop and deploy. We need to use data analysis to move goods and energy more efficiently and intelligently. We need to consider raising more of our food in water and using food by-products and waste to help sequester carbon. In short, we need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That challenge seems destined to grow more daunting in the coming years. There are still, Wang observes, areas of “energy poverty”—places where people cannot access sufficient energy to sustain their well-being. But solving that problem will only drive up energy production and consumption worldwide. The explosive growth of AI will likely do the same, since the huge data centers that power the technology require enormous quantities of energy for both computation and cooling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang believes that while AI will continue to drive electricity demand, it can also contribute to creating a more sustainable future.“We can use AI to develop climate and energy solutions,” she says. “AI can play a primary role in solution sets, can give us new and improved ways to manage intermittent loads in the energy grid. It can help us develop new catalysts and chemicals or help us stabilize the plasma we’ll use in nuclear fusion. It could augment climate and geospatial modeling that would allow us to predict the impact of potential climate solutions before we implement them. We could even use AI to reduce computational needs and thereby ease cooling demand.”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Change the narrative, change the culture &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MIT was humming with climate and energy research long before Wang returned to campus in 2025 after wrapping up her work at ARPA-E. Almost 400 researchers across 90% of MIT’s departments responded to President Reif’s 2020 Climate Grand Challenges initiative. The Institute awarded $2.7 million to 27 finalist teams and identified five flagship projects, including one to create an early warning system to help mitigate the impact of climate disasters, another to predict and prepare for extreme weather events, and an ambitious project to slash nearly half of all industrial carbon emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;About 250 MIT faculty and senior researchers are now involved in the Climate Project at MIT, a campus-wide initiative launched in 2024 that works to generate and implement climate solutions, tools, and policy proposals. Conceived to bolster MIT’s already significant efforts as a leading source of technological, behavioral, and policy solutions to global climate issues, the Climate Project has identified six “missions”: decarbonizing energy and industry; preserving the atmosphere, land, and oceans; empowering frontline community action; designing resilient and prosperous cities; enabling new policy approaches; and wild cards, a catch-all category that supports development of unconventional solutions outside the scope of the other missions. Faculty members direct each mission.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With so much climate research already underway,a large part of Wang’s new role is to support and deepen existing projects. But to fully tap into MIT’s unique capabilities, she says, she’s aiming to foster some cultural shifts. And that begins with identifying ways to facilitate cooperation—both across the Institute and with external partners—on a scale that can make “something truly transformational” happen, she says. “At this stage, with the challenges we face in energy and climate, we need to do something ambitious.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129150" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MIT-Solar-Thermal-1-Press.jpg?w=1708" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This solar thermophotovoltaic device Wang’s lab developed with Marin Soljačić converts solar heat that’s usually wasted into usable light, potentially doubling the efficiency of typical solar cells.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE RESEARCHERS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129149" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MIT-Heat-Collection-01-PRESS.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wang’s group worked with Gang Chen’s lab to develop this highly transparent insulating silica aerogel.

And traditionally we’ve done that well, often with outstanding results. But climate and energy are systems problems, which means we need to create a systems solution. How do we bring these diverse faculty together? How do we align their efforts, not just in technology, but also in policy, science, finance, and social sciences?” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To encourage MIT faculty to collaborate across departments, schools, and disciplines, Wang recently announced that the MIT Climate Project would award grants of $50,000 to $250,000 to collaborative faculty teams that work on six- to 24-month climate research projects. Student teams are invited to apply for research grants of up to $15,000.“We can’t afford to work in silos,” she says. “People from wildly diverse fields are working on the same problems and speaking different professional languages. We need to bring people together in an integrative way so we can attack the problem holistically.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang also wants colleagues to reach beyond campus. MIT, she says, needs to form real, defined partnerships with other universities, as well as with industries, investors, and philanthropists. “This isn’t just an MIT problem,” she says. “Individual efforts and 1,000 flowers alone will not be enough to meet these challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thinking holistically—and in terms of systems—will help focus efforts on the areas that will have the greatest impact. At a Climate Project presentation in October, Wang outlined an approach that would focus on building well-being within communities. This will begin with efforts to empower communities by developing coastal resilience, to decarbonize ports and shipping, and to design and build data centers that integrate smoothly and sustainably with nearby communities. She encouraged her colleagues to think in terms of big-picture solutions for the future and then to work on the components needed to build that future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“As researchers, we sometimes jump to a solution before we have fully defined the problem,” she explains. “Let’s take the problem of decarbonization in transportation. The solution we’ve come up with is to electrify our vehicles. When we run up against the problem of the range of these vehicles, our first thought is to create higher-density batteries. But the real problem we’re facing isn’t about batteries. It’s about increasing the range of these vehicles. And the solution to that problem isn’t necessarily a more powerful battery.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom … The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang is confident that her MIT colleagues have both the capacity and the desire to embrace the holistic approach she envisions. “When I was accepted to MIT as an undergraduate and visited the campus, the thing that made me certain I wanted to enroll here was the people,” she recalls. “They weren’t just talented. They had so many different interests. They were passionate about solving big problems. And they were eager to learn from one another. That spirit hasn’t changed. And that’s the spirit I and my team can tap into.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang believes MIT and other institutions working on climate and energy solutions also need to change how we talk about the challenge. “Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom,” she says. “The underlying issue here is our well-being. That’s what we care about, not the climate. The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing? How can we create conditions of resilience, sustainability, and prosperity? That is the framework I would like us to build on.” For example, in areas where extreme weather threatens homes or rising temperatures are harming human health, we should be developing affordable technologies that make dwellings more resilient and keep people cooler.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Wang’s colleagues at MIT concur with her assessment of the mission ahead. They also have a deep respect for her scholarship and leadership. “I couldn’t think of a better person to represent MIT’s diverse and powerful ability to attack climate,” says Susan Solomon, the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies at MIT and recipient of the US National Medal of Science for her work on the Antarctic ozone hole. “Communicating MIT’s capabilities to provide what the nation needs—not only in engineering but also in … economics, the physical, chemical, and biological sciences, and much more—is an immense challenge.” But she’s confident that Wang will do it justice. “Evelyn is a consummate storyteller,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“She’s tremendously quick at learning new fields and driving toward what the real nuggets are that need to be addressed in solving hard problems,” says Elsa Olivetti, PhD ’07, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering and director of the MIT Climate Project’s Decarbonizing Energy and Industry mission. “Her direct, meticulous thinking and leadership style mean that she can focus teams within her office to do the work that will be most impactful at scale.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wang’s experience at ARPA-E is expected to be especially useful. “The current geopolitical situation and the limited amount of research funding available relative to the scale of the climate problem pose formidable challenges to bringing MIT’s strengths to bear on the problem,” says Rohit Karnik, director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) and a collaborator with Wang on numerous projects and initiatives since both joined the mechanical engineering faculty in 2007. “Evelyn’s leadership experience at MIT and in government, her ability to take a complex situation and define a clear vision, and her passion to make a difference will serve her well in her new role.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang’s new MIT appointment is seen as a good thing beyond the Institute as well. “A role like this requires a skill set that is difficult to find in one individual,” says Krista Walton, vice chancellor for research and innovation at North Carolina State University. Walton and Wang collaborated on multiple projects, including the DARPA work that produced the device for extracting water from very dry air based on the original prototype Wang co-developed. “You need scientific depth, an understanding of the federal and global landscape, a collaborative instinct and the ability to be a convener, and a strategic vision,” Walton says—and she can’t imagine a better pick for the job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Evelyn has an extraordinary ability to bridge fundamental science with real-world application,” she says. “She approaches collaboration as a true partnership and not as a transaction.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A challenging funding climate&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Climate scientists explore broad swaths of time, tracking trends in temperature, greenhouse gases, volcanic activity, vegetation, and more across hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years. Even average temperatures and precipitation levels are calculated over periods of three decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129148" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MIT_News_10_24_25_36614.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wang and grad students Jan Luka Čas, SM ’25, and Briana Cuero examine a small test device for a hydrogel-based thermal battery they are developing with fellow PhD student Liliosa Cole.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;KEN RICHARDSON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in the realm of politics, change happens much faster, prompting sudden and sometimes startling shifts in culture and policy. The current US administration has proposed widespread budget cuts in climate and energy research. These have included slicing more than $1.5 billion from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), canceling multiple climate-related missions at NASA, and shuttering the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the agency responsible for publishing the National Climate Assessment. The Trump administration submitted a budget request that would cut the National Science Foundation budget from more than $9 billion to just over $4 billion for 2026. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that NSF grant funding for STEM education from January through mid-May 2025 was down 80% from its 10-year average, while NSF grant awards for math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and materials science research were down 67%. In September, the US Department of Energy announced it had terminated 223 projects that “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Among the agencies affected is ARPA-E, the agency Wang directed before returning to MIT. Meanwhile, MIT research programs that rely on government sources of funding will also feel the impact of the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Acknowledging the difficulties she and MIT may face in the present moment, Wang still prefers to look forward. “Of course this is a challenging time,” she says. “There are near-term challenges and long-term challenges. We need to focus on those long-term challenges. As President Kornbluth has said, we need to continue to advocate for research and education. We need to pursue long-term solutions, to follow our convictions in addressing problems in energy and climate. And we need to be ready to seize the opportunities that reside in these long-term challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wang also sees openings for short-term collaboration—areas where MIT and the current administration can find common ground and goals. “There is still a huge area of opportunity for us to align our interests with those of this administration,” she says. “We can move the needle forward together on energy, on national security, on minerals, on economic competitiveness. All these are interests we share, and there are pathways we can follow to meet these challenges to our nation together. MIT is a major force in the nuclear space, in both fission and fusion. These, along with geothermal, could provide the power base we need to meet our energy demands. There are significant opportunities for partnerships with this or any administration to unlock some of these innovations and implement them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A moonshot factory&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While she views herself as a researcher and an academic, Wang’s relevant government experience should prove especially useful in her VP role at MIT. In her two years as director of ARPA-E, she coordinated a broad array of the US Department of Energy’s early-stage research and development in energy generation, storage, and use. “I think I had the best job in government,” she says. Designed to operate at arm’s length from the Department of Energy, ARPA-E searches for high-risk, high-reward energy innovation projects. “More than one observer has called ARPA-E a moonshot factory,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seeking out and facilitating “moonshot”-­worthy projects at a national and sometimes global scale gave Wang a broader lens through which to view issues of energy and climate. It also taught her that big ideas do not translate into big solutions automatically. “I learned what it takes to make an impact on energy technology at ARPA-E and I will be forever grateful,” she says. “I saw how game-changing ideas can take a decade to go from concept to deployment. I learned to appreciate the diversity of talent and innovation in the national ecosystem composed of laboratories, startups, and institutions. I saw how that ecosystem could zero in to identify real problems, envision diverse pathways, and create prototypes. And I also saw just how hard that journey is.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"&gt;Climate and energy research at MIT&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT researchers are tackling climate and energy issues from multiple angles, working on everything from decarbonizing energy and industry to designing resilient and prosperous cities. Find out more at&lt;/strong&gt; climateproject.mit.edu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While MIT is already an important element in that ecosystem, Wang and her colleagues want the Institute to play an even more prominent role. “We can be a convener and collaborator, first across all of MIT’s departments, and then with industry, the financial world, and governments,” she says. “We need to do aggressive outreach and find like-minded partners.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Although the problems of climate and climate change are global, the most effective way MIT can address them is locally,” said Wang at the October presentation of the MIT Climate Project. “Working across schools and disciplines, collaborating with external partners, we will develop targeted solutions for individual places and communities—solutions that can then serve as templates for other places and communities.” But she also cautions against one-size-fits-all solutions. “Solar panels, for example, work wonderfully, but only in areas that have sufficient space and sunlight,” she explains. “Institutions like MIT can showcase a diversity of approaches and determine the best approach for each individual context.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most of all, Wang wants her colleagues to be proactive. “Because MIT is a factory of ideas, perhaps even a moonshot factory, we need to think boldly and continue to think boldly so we can make an impact as soon as possible,” she says. She also wants her colleagues to stay hopeful and not feel daunted by a challenge that can at times feel overwhelming. “We will build pilots, one at a time, and demonstrate that these projects are not only possible but practical,” she says. “And that is how we will build a future everyone wants to live in.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/06/1128655/powering-up-and-saving-the-planet/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] A viral Reddit post alleging fraud from a food delivery app turned out to be AI-generated (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/a-viral-reddit-post-alleging-fraud-from-a-food-delivery-app-turned-out-to-be-ai-generated/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/reddit-ipo-v2.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A Reddit user claiming to be a whistleblower from a food delivery app has been outed as a fake. The user wrote a viral post alleging that the company he worked for was exploiting its drivers and users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You guys always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality is actually so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories,” the supposed whistleblower wrote.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He claimed to be drunk and at the library to use its public Wi-Fi, where he was typing this long screed about how the company was exploiting legal loopholes to steal drivers’ tips and wages with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those claims were, unfortunately, believable — DoorDash actually &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; sued for stealing tips from drivers, resulting in a $16.75 million settlement. But in this case, the poster had made up his story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;People lie on the internet all the time. But it’s not so common for such posts to hit the front page of Reddit, garner over 87,000 upvotes, and get crossposted to other platforms like X, where it got another 208,000 likes and 36.8 million impressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Casey Newton, the journalist behind Platformer, wrote that he contacted the Reddit poster, who then contacted him on Signal. The Redditor shared what looked like a photo of his UberEats employee badge, as well as an 18-page “internal document” outlining the company’s use of AI to determine the “desperation score” of individual drivers. But as Newton tried to verify that the whistleblower’s account was legitimate, he realized that he was being baited into an AI hoax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together,” Newton wrote. “Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have always been bad actors seeking to deceive reporters, but the prevalence of AI tools has made fact-checking require even more rigor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Generative AI models often fail to detect if an image or video is synthetic, making it challenging to determine if content is real. In this case, Newton was able to use Google’s Gemini to confirm that the image was made with the AI tool, thanks to Google’s SynthID watermark, which can withstand cropping, compression, filtering, and other attempts to alter an image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Max Spero — founder of Pangram Labs, a company that makes a detection tool for AI-generated text — works directly with the problem of distinguishing real and fake content.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI slop on the internet has gotten a lot worse, and I think part of this is due to the increased use of LLMs, but other factors as well,” Spero told TechCrunch. “There’s companies with millions in revenue that can pay for ‘organic engagement’ on Reddit, which is actually just that they’re going to try to go viral on Reddit with AI-generated posts that mention your brand name.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tools like Pangram can help determine if text is AI-generated, but especially when it comes to multimedia content, these tools aren’t always reliable — and even if a synthetic post is proven to be fake, it might have already gone viral before being debunked. So for now, we’re left scrolling social media like detectives, second-guessing if anything we see is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Case in point: When I told an editor that I wanted to write about the “viral AI food delivery hoax that was on Reddit this weekend,” she thought I was talking about something else.

Yes — there was more than one “viral AI food delivery hoax on Reddit this weekend.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/a-viral-reddit-post-alleging-fraud-from-a-food-delivery-app-turned-out-to-be-ai-generated/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:23:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] CES 2026: Everything revealed, from Nvidia’s debuts to AMD’s new chips to Razer’s AI oddities (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/ces-2026-everything-revealed-from-nvidias-debuts-to-amds-new-chips-to-razers-ai-oddities/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254217759.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;CES 2026&amp;nbsp;is in full swing in Las Vegas, with the show floor open to the public after a packed couple of days&amp;nbsp;occupied by&amp;nbsp;press conferences from the likes of Nvidia, Sony, and AMD&amp;nbsp;and previews from Sunday’s Unveiled event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As has been the case for the past two years at CES, AI is at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware&amp;nbsp;upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. We’ll&amp;nbsp;be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still catch&amp;nbsp;the spur-of-the-moment reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground&amp;nbsp;via our live blog right here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Let’s&amp;nbsp;dive right in, starting with some of Monday’s biggest players.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-reveals-ai-model-for-autonomous-vehicles-showcases-rubin-architecture"&gt;Nvidia reveals AI model for autonomous vehicles, showcases Rubin architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes,&amp;nbsp;setting the stage for 2026, and yes,&amp;nbsp;hanging out with some robots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Rubin computing&amp;nbsp;architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is&amp;nbsp;set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our&amp;nbsp;Senior AI&amp;nbsp;Editor&amp;nbsp;Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world,&amp;nbsp;showcasing its Alpamayo family of open-source AI models&amp;nbsp;and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year.&amp;nbsp;That approach, as Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amd-s-keynote-highlights-new-processors-and-partnerships-nbsp"&gt;AMD’s keynote highlights new processors and partnerships&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners including OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Lei,&amp;nbsp;Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond the&amp;nbsp;partner&amp;nbsp;showcases, Senior Reporter Rebecca Szkutak&amp;nbsp;detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers&amp;nbsp;using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-boston-dynamics-and-google-partner-on-atlas-robots"&gt;Boston Dynamics and Google partner on Atlas robots&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that&amp;nbsp;they’re&amp;nbsp;working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors&amp;nbsp;to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of Atlas that was shown on stage.&amp;nbsp;Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push&amp;nbsp;you’d&amp;nbsp;expect at CES, with&amp;nbsp;the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers&amp;nbsp;looking to use the chatbot via its browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer Editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on&amp;nbsp;Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new&amp;nbsp;Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the Ring front, Consumer Reporter Ivan Mehta&amp;nbsp;runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and&amp;nbsp;more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-razer-joins-the-ai-deluge-with-project-ava-and-motoko"&gt;Razer joins the AI deluge&amp;nbsp;with Project AVA and Motoko&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES,&amp;nbsp;from three-screen laptops&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;haptic gaming cushions&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project&amp;nbsp;Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but&amp;nbsp;without&amp;nbsp;the glasses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk.&amp;nbsp;We’ll&amp;nbsp;let you watch the concept video for yourself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lego-smart-bricks-mark-the-company-s-first-ces-appearance"&gt;Lego Smart Bricks mark the company’s first CES appearance&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which&amp;nbsp;includes&amp;nbsp;bricks, tiles and Minifigures that can all interact with each other&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;play sounds, with the debut sets both having a Star Wars theme. Senior Writer Amanda&amp;nbsp;Silberling&amp;nbsp;has all the details here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
