It will build on an effort to improve the collection of emissions data that former president Joe Biden launched in 2023—and which President Trump nullified on his first day in office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The initiative will help prioritize responses to changes in federal greenhouse-gas monitoring and measurement programs, but the Data Foundation stresses that it will primarily serve a “long-standing need for coordination” of such efforts outside of government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new greenhouse-gas coalition is one of a growing number of nonprofit and academic groups that have spun up or shifted focus to keep essential climate monitoring and research efforts going amid the Trump administration’s assault on environmental funding, staffing, and regulations. Those include efforts to ensure that US scientists can continue to contribute to the UN’s major climate report and publish assessments of the rising domestic risks of climate change. Otherwise, the loss of these programs will make it increasingly difficult for communities to understand how more frequent or severe wildfires, droughts, heat waves, and floods will harm them—and how dire the dangers could become.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Few believe that nonprofits or private industry can come close to filling the funding holes that the Trump administration is digging. But observers say it’s essential to try to sustain efforts to understand the risks of climate change that the federal government has historically overseen, even if the attempts are merely stopgap measures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we give up these sources of emissions data, “we’re flying blind,” says Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “We’re deliberating taking away the very information that would help us understand the problem and how to address it best.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Improving emissions estimates&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the US Forest Service, and other agencies have long collected information about greenhouse gases in a variety of ways. These include self-reporting by industry; shipboard, balloon, and aircraft readings of gas concentrations in the atmosphere; satellite measurements of the carbon dioxide and methane released by wildfires; and on-the-ground measurements of trees. The EPA, in turn, collects and publishes the data from these disparate sources as the Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that report comes out on a two-year lag, and studies show that some of the estimates it relies on could be way off—particularly the self-reported ones.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A recent analysis using satellites to measure methane pollution from four large landfills found they produce, on average, six times more emissions than the facilities had reported to the EPA. Likewise, a 2018 study in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; found that the actual methane leaks from oil and gas infrastructure were about 60% higher than the self-reported estimates in the agency’s inventory.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s initiative—the National Strategy to Advance an Integrated US Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System—aimed to adopt state-of-the-art tools and methods to improve the accuracy of these estimates, including satellites and other monitoring technologies that can replace or check self-reported information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The administration specifically sought to achieve these improvements through partnerships between government, industry, and nonprofits. The initiative called for the data collected across groups to be published to an online portal in formats that would be accessible to policymakers and the public.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moving toward a system that produces more current and reliable data is essential for understanding the rising risks of climate change and tracking whether industries are abiding by government regulations and voluntary climate commitments, says Ben Poulter, a former NASA scientist who coordinated the Biden administration effort as a deputy director in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Once you have this operational system, you can provide near-real-time information that can help drive climate action,” Poulter says. He is now a senior scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, a nonprofit focused on accelerating emerging methods of combating climate change, and he is advising the Data Foundation’s Climate Data Collaborative, which is overseeing the new greenhouse-gas initiative.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Slashed staffing and funding&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the momentum behind the federal strategy deflated when Trump returned to office. On his first day, he signed an executive order that effectively halted it. The White House has since slashed staffing across the agencies at the heart of the effort, sought to shut down specific programs that generate emissions data, and raised uncertainties about the fate of numerous other program components.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;In April, the administration missed a deadline to share the updated greenhouse-gas inventory with the United Nations, for the first time in three decades, as &lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt; reported. It eventually did release the report in May, but only after the Environmental Defense Fund filed a Freedom of Information Act request.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are also indications that the collection of emissions data might be in jeopardy. In March, the EPA said it would “reconsider” the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires thousands of power plants, refineries, and other industrial facilities to report emissions each year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, the tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law earlier this month rescinds provisions in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that provided incentives or funding for corporate greenhouse-gas reporting and methane monitoring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the White House has also proposed slashing funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and shuttering a number of its labs. Those include the facility that supports the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, the world’s longest-running carbon dioxide measuring program, as well as the Global Monitoring Laboratory, which operates a global network of collection flasks that capture air samples used to measure concentrations of nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and other greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the latest appropriations negotiations, Congress seems set to spare NOAA and other agencies the full cuts pushed by the Trump administration, but that may or may not protect various climate programs within them. As observers have noted, the loss of experts throughout the federal government, coupled with the priorities set by Trump-appointed leaders of those agencies, could still prevent crucial emissions data from being collected, analyzed, and published.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“That’s a huge concern,” says David Hayes, a professor at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, who previously worked on the effort to upgrade the nation’s emissions measurement and monitoring as special assistant to President Biden for climate policy. It’s not clear “whether they’re going to continue and whether the data availability will drop off.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘A natural disaster’&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amid all these cutbacks and uncertainties, those still hoping to make progress toward an improved system for measuring greenhouse gases have had to adjust their expectations: It’s now at least as important to simply preserve or replace existing federal programs as it is to move toward more modern tools and methods.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Ryan Alexander, executive director of the Data Foundation’s Climate Data Collaborative, is optimistic that there will be opportunities to do both.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;She says the new greenhouse-gas coalition will strive to identify the highest-priority needs and help other nonprofits or companies accelerate the development of new tools or methods. It will also aim to ensure that these organizations avoid replicating one another’s efforts and deliver data with high scientific standards, in open and interoperable formats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Data Foundation declines to say what other nonprofits will be members of the coalition or how much money it hopes to raise, but it plans to make a formal announcement in the coming weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Nonprofits and companies are already playing a larger role in monitoring emissions, including organizations like Carbon Mapper, which operates satellites and aircraft that detect and measure methane emissions from particular facilities. The EDF also launched a satellite last year, known as MethaneSAT, that could spot large and small sources of emissions—though it lost power earlier this month and probably cannot be recovered.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alexander notes that shifting from self-reported figures to observational technology like satellites could not just replace but perhaps also improve on the EPA reporting program that the Trump administration has moved to shut down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the “dramatic changes” brought about by this administration, “the future will not be the past,” she says. “This is like a natural disaster. We can’t think about rebuilding in the way that things have been in the past. We have to look ahead and say, ‘What is needed? What can people afford?’”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Organizations can also use this moment to test and develop emerging technologies that could improve greenhouse-gas measurements, including novel sensors or artificial intelligence tools, Hayes says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We are at a time when we have these new tools, new technologies for measurement, measuring, and monitoring,” he says. “To some extent it’s a new era anyway, so it’s a great time to do some pilot testing here and to demonstrate how we can create new data sets in the climate area.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Saving scientific contributions&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not just the collection of emissions data that nonprofits and academic groups are hoping to save. Notably, the American Geophysical Union and its partners have taken on two additional climate responsibilities that traditionally fell to the federal government.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The US State Department’s Office of Global Change historically coordinated the nation’s contributions to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s major reports on climate risks, soliciting and nominating US scientists to help write, oversee, or edit sections of the assessments. The US Global Change Research Program, an interagency group that ran much of the process, also covered the cost of trips to a series of in-person meetings with international collaborators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the US government seems to have relinquished any involvement as the IPCC kicks off the process for the Seventh Assessment Report. In late February, the administration blocked federal scientists including NASA’s Katherine Calvin, who was previously selected as a cochair for one of the working groups, from attending an early planning meeting in China. (Calvin was the agency’s chief scientist at the time but was no longer serving in that role as of April, according to NASA’s website.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The agency didn’t respond to inquiries from interested scientists after the UN panel issued a call for nominations in March, and it failed to present a list of nominations by the deadline in April, scientists involved in the process say. The Trump administration also canceled funding for the Global Change Research Program and, earlier this month, fired the last remaining staffers working at the Office of Global Change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In response, 10 universities came together in March to form the US Academic Alliance for the IPCC, in partnership with the AGU, to request and evalute applications from US researchers. The universities—which include Yale, Princeton, and the University of California, San Diego—together nominated nearly 300 scientists, some of whom the IPCC has since officially selected. The AGU is now conducting a fundraising campaign to help pay for travel expenses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pamela McElwee, a professor at Rutgers who helped establish the academic coalition, says it’s crucial for US scientists to continue participating in the IPCC process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It is our flagship global assessment report on the state of climate, and it plays a really important role in influencing country policies,” she says. “To not be part of it makes it much more difficult for US scientists to be at the cutting edge and advance the things we need to do.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AGU also stepped in two months later, after the White House dismissed hundreds of researchers working on the National Climate Assessment, an annual report analyzing the rising dangers of climate change across the country. The AGU and American Meteorological Society together announced plans to publish a “special collection” to sustain the momentum of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s incumbent on us to ensure our communities, our neighbors, our children are all protected and prepared for the mounting risks of climate change,” said Brandon Jones, president of the AGU, in an earlier statement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AGU declined to discuss the status of the project.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Stopgap solution&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The sheer number of programs the White House is going after will require organizations to make hard choices about what they attempt to save and how they go about it. Moreover, relying entirely on nonprofits and companies to take over these federal tasks is not viable over the long term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the costs of these federal programs, it could prove prohibitive to even keep a minimum viable version of some essential monitoring systems and research programs up and running. Dispersing across various organizations the responsibility of calculating the nation’s emissions sources and sinks also creates concerns about the scientific standards applied and the accessibility of that data, Cleetus says. Plus, moving away from the records that NOAA, NASA, and other agencies have collected for decades would break the continuity of that data, undermining the ability to detect or project trends.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More basically, publishing national emissions data should be a federal responsibility, particularly for the government of the world’s second-largest climate polluter, Cleetus adds. Failing to calculate and share its contributions to climate change sidesteps the nation’s global responsibilities and sends a terrible signal to other countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Poulter stresses that nonprofits and the private sector can do only so much, for so long, to keep these systems up and running.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to give the impression that this greenhouse-gas coalition, if it gets off the ground, is a long-term solution,” he says. “But we can’t afford to have gaps in these data sets, so somebody needs to step in and help sustain those measurements.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250724-greenhouse-gases-nonprofit.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nonprofits are striving to preserve a US effort to modernize greenhouse-gas measurements, amid growing fears that the Trump administration’s dismantling of federal programs will obscure the nation’s contributions to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Data Foundation, a Washington, DC, nonprofit that advocates for open data, is fundraising for an initiative that will coordinate efforts among nonprofits, technical experts, and companies to improve the accuracy and accessibility of climate emissions information.

(Calvin was the agency’s chief scientist at the time but was no longer serving in that role as of April, according to NASA’s website.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The agency didn’t respond to inquiries from interested scientists after the UN panel issued a call for nominations in March, and it failed to present a list of nominations by the deadline in April, scientists involved in the process say. The Trump administration also canceled funding for the Global Change Research Program and, earlier this month, fired the last remaining staffers working at the Office of Global Change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In response, 10 universities came together in March to form the US Academic Alliance for the IPCC, in partnership with the AGU, to request and evalute applications from US researchers. The universities—which include Yale, Princeton, and the University of California, San Diego—together nominated nearly 300 scientists, some of whom the IPCC has since officially selected. The AGU is now conducting a fundraising campaign to help pay for travel expenses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pamela McElwee, a professor at Rutgers who helped establish the academic coalition, says it’s crucial for US scientists to continue participating in the IPCC process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It is our flagship global assessment report on the state of climate, and it plays a really important role in influencing country policies,” she says. “To not be part of it makes it much more difficult for US scientists to be at the cutting edge and advance the things we need to do.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AGU also stepped in two months later, after the White House dismissed hundreds of researchers working on the National Climate Assessment, an annual report analyzing the rising dangers of climate change across the country. The AGU and American Meteorological Society together announced plans to publish a “special collection” to sustain the momentum of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s incumbent on us to ensure our communities, our neighbors, our children are all protected and prepared for the mounting risks of climate change,” said Brandon Jones, president of the AGU, in an earlier statement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AGU declined to discuss the status of the project.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Stopgap solution&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The sheer number of programs the White House is going after will require organizations to make hard choices about what they attempt to save and how they go about it. Moreover, relying entirely on nonprofits and companies to take over these federal tasks is not viable over the long term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the costs of these federal programs, it could prove prohibitive to even keep a minimum viable version of some essential monitoring systems and research programs up and running. Dispersing across various organizations the responsibility of calculating the nation’s emissions sources and sinks also creates concerns about the scientific standards applied and the accessibility of that data, Cleetus says. Plus, moving away from the records that NOAA, NASA, and other agencies have collected for decades would break the continuity of that data, undermining the ability to detect or project trends.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More basically, publishing national emissions data should be a federal responsibility, particularly for the government of the world’s second-largest climate polluter, Cleetus adds. Failing to calculate and share its contributions to climate change sidesteps the nation’s global responsibilities and sends a terrible signal to other countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Poulter stresses that nonprofits and the private sector can do only so much, for so long, to keep these systems up and running.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to give the impression that this greenhouse-gas coalition, if it gets off the ground, is a long-term solution,” he says. “But we can’t afford to have gaps in these data sets, so somebody needs to step in and help sustain those measurements.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/25/1120636/how-nonprofits-and-academia-are-stepping-up-to-salvage-us-climate-programs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The deadly saga of the controversial gene therapy Elevidys (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/25/1120621/deadly-saga-controversial-gene-therapy-elevidys/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sarepta.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has been a grim few months for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) community. There had been some excitement when, a couple of years ago, a gene therapy for the disorder was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the first time. That drug, Elevidys, has now been implicated in the deaths of two teenage boys.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The drug’s approval was always controversial—there was a lack of evidence that it actually worked, for starters. But the agency that once rubber-stamped the drug has now turned on its manufacturer, Sarepta Therapeutics. In a remarkable chain of events, the FDA asked the company to stop shipping the drug on July 18. Sarepta refused to comply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the days since, the company has acquiesced. But its reputation has already been hit. And the events have dealt a devastating blow to people desperate for treatments that might help them, their children, or other family members with DMD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DMD is a rare genetic disorder that causes muscles to degenerate over time.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s caused by a mutation in a gene that codes for a protein called dystrophin. That protein is essential for muscles—without it, muscles weaken and waste away. The disease mostly affects boys, and symptoms usually start in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;At first, affected children usually start to find it hard to jump or climb stairs. But as the disease progresses, other movements become difficult too. Eventually, the condition might affect the heart and lungs. The life expectancy of a person with DMD has recently improved, but it is still only around 30 or 40 years. There is no cure. It’s a devastating diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elevidys was designed to replace missing dystrophin with a shortened, engineered version of the protein. In June 2023,&amp;nbsp;the FDA approved the therapy for eligible four- and five-year-olds. It came with a $3.2 million price tag.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The approval was celebrated by people affected by DMD, says Debra Miller, founder of CureDuchenne, an organization that funds research into the condition and offers support to those affected by it. "We've not had much in the way of meaningful therapies," she says. "The excitement was great."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the approval was controversial.&lt;/strong&gt; It came under an “accelerated approval” program that essentially lowers the bar of evidence for drugs designed to treat “serious or life-threatening diseases where there is an unmet medical need.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elevidys was approved because it appeared to increase levels of the engineered protein in patients’ muscles. But it had not been shown to improve patient outcomes: It had failed a randomized clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The FDA approval was granted on the condition that Sarepta complete another clinical trial. The&amp;nbsp;topline results of that trial were described in October 2023 and&amp;nbsp;were published in detail a year later. Again, the drug failed to meet its “primary endpoint”—in other words, it didn’t work as well as hoped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In June 2024, the FDA &lt;em&gt;expanded&lt;/em&gt; the approval of Elevidys.&lt;/strong&gt; It granted traditional approval for the drug to treat people with DMD who are over the age of four and can walk independently, and another accelerated approval for those who can’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some experts were appalled at the FDA’s decision—even some within the FDA disagreed with it. But things weren’t so simple for people living with DMD. I spoke to some parents of such children&amp;nbsp;a couple of years ago. They pointed out that drug approvals can help bring interest and investment to DMD research. And, above all, they were desperate for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; drug that might help their children. They were desperate for hope.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately, the treatment does not appear to be delivering on that hope.&lt;/strong&gt; There have always been questions over whether it works. But now there are serious questions over how safe it is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In March 2025, a 16-year-old boy died after being treated with Elevidys. He had developed acute liver failure (ALF) after having the treatment, Sarepta&amp;nbsp;said in a statement. On June 15, the company&amp;nbsp;announced a second death—a 15-year-old who also developed ALF following Elevidys treatment. The company said it would pause shipments of the drug,&amp;nbsp;but only for patients who are not able to walk.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The following day, Sarepta held&amp;nbsp;an online presentation in which CEO Doug Ingram said that the company was exploring ways to make the treatment safer, perhaps by treating recipients with another drug that dampens their immune systems. But that same day, the company announced that&amp;nbsp;it was laying off 500 employees—36% of its workforce. Sarepta did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On June 24, the FDA&amp;nbsp;announced that it was investigating the risks of serious outcomes&lt;/strong&gt; “including hospitalization and death” associated with Elevidys, and “evaluating the need for further regulatory action.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was more tragic news on July 18, when there were&amp;nbsp;reports that a third patient had died following a Sarepta treatment. This patient, a 51-year-old, hadn’t been taking Elevidys but was enrolled in a clinical trial for a different Sarepta gene therapy designed to treat limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The same day,&amp;nbsp;the FDA asked Sarepta to voluntarily pause &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; shipments of Elevidys. Sarepta&amp;nbsp;refused to do so.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The refusal was surprising,&lt;/strong&gt; says Michael Kelly, chief scientific officer at CureDuchenne: “It was an unusual step to take.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After&amp;nbsp;significant&amp;nbsp;media&amp;nbsp;coverage, including reporting that&amp;nbsp;the FDA was “deeply troubled” by the decision and would use its “full regulatory authority,” Sarepta backed down a few days later. On July 21, the company announced its decision to&amp;nbsp;“voluntarily and temporarily” pause all shipments of Elevidys in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sarepta says it will now work with the FDA to address safety and labeling concerns. But in the meantime, the saga has left the DMD community grappling with “a mix of disappointment and concern,” says Kelly. Many are worried about the risks of taking the treatment. Others are devastated that they are no longer able to access it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Miller says she knows of families who have been working with their insurance providers to get authorization for the drug. "It's like the rug has been pulled out from under them," she says. Many families have no other treatment options. "And we know what happens when you do nothing with Duchenne," she says. Others, particularly those with teenage children with DMD, are deciding against trying the drug, she adds. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The decision over whether to take Elevidys was already a personal one based on several factors, he says. &lt;/strong&gt;People with DMD and their families deserve clear and transparent information about the treatment in order to make that decision.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The FDA's decision to approve Elevidys was made on limited data, says Kelly. But as things stand today, over 900 people have been treated with Elevidys. "That gives the FDA... an opportunity to look at real data and make informed decisions," he says. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Families facing Duchenne do not have time to waste,” Kelly says. “They must navigate a landscape where hope is tempered by the realities of medical complexity.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

Makers of these so-called “vibe-coding” tools are a hot commodity at the moment, with startups like Lovable and Cursor fending off buyers and investors keen to tap a hot trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s now become the latest to hop on this bandwagon: The company is testing a vibe-coding tool called Opal, available to users in the U.S. through Google Labs, which the company uses as a base to experiment with new tech.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opal lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, or you can remix existing apps available in a gallery. All users have to do is enter a description of the app they want to make, and the tool will then use different Google models to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once the app is ready, you can navigate into an editor panel to see the visual workflow of input, output, and generation steps. You can click on each workflow step to look at the prompt that dictates the process, and edit it if you need to. You also can manually add steps from Opal’s toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opal also lets users publish their new app on the web and share the link with others to test out using their own Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s AI studio already lets developers build apps using prompts, but Opal’s visual workflow indicates the company likely wants to target a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

Makers of these so-called “vibe-coding” tools are a hot commodity at the moment, with startups like Lovable and Cursor fending off buyers and investors keen to tap a hot trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s now become the latest to hop on this bandwagon: The company is testing a vibe-coding tool called Opal, available to users in the U.S. through Google Labs, which the company uses as a base to experiment with new tech.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opal lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, or you can remix existing apps available in a gallery. All users have to do is enter a description of the app they want to make, and the tool will then use different Google models to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

Mistake an unconscious AI for a conscious one, and you risk compromising human safety and happiness for the sake of an unthinking, unfeeling hunk of silicon and code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, a small research community has doggedly attacked the question of what consciousness is and how it works. The effort has yielded real progress. And now, with the rapid advance of AI technology, these insights could offer our only guide to the untested, morally fraught waters of artificial consciousness.

Over the past three months, the Qwen team has been hard at work scaling up what they call the “thinking capability” of their AI, aiming to improve both the quality and depth of its reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of their efforts is a model that excels at the really tough stuff: logical reasoning, complex maths, science problems, and advanced coding. In these areas that typically require a human expert, this new Qwen model is now setting the standard for open-source models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On reasoning benchmarks, Qwen’s latest open-source AI model achieves 92.3 on AIME25 and 74.1 on LiveCodeBench v6 for coding. It also holds its own in more general capability tests, scoring 79.7 on Arena-Hard v2, which measures how well it aligns with human preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Benchmarks from the Alibaba Qwen team for their latest Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 open-source reasoning AI model compared to rivals." class="wp-image-107208" height="576" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507-qwen-ai-model-reasoning-benchmarks-alibaba-1024x576.jpeg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its heart, this is a massive reasoning AI model from the Qwen team with 235 billion parameters in total. However, it uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which means it only activates a fraction of those parameters – about 22 billion – at any one time. Think of it like having a huge team of 128 specialists on call, but only the eight best-suited for a specific task are brought in to actually work on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of its most impressive features is its massive memory. Qwen’s open-source reasoning AI model has a native context length of 262,144 tokens; a huge advantage for tasks that involve understanding vast amounts of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the developers and tinkerers out there, the Qwen team has made it easy to get started. The model is available on Hugging Face. You can deploy it using tools like sglang or vllm to create your own API endpoint. The team also points to their Qwen-Agent framework as the best way to make use of the model’s tool-calling skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the best performance from their open-source AI reasoning model, the Qwen team have shared a few tips. They suggest an output length of around 32,768 tokens for most tasks, but for really complex challenges, you should boost that to 81,920 tokens to give the AI enough room to “think”. They also recommend giving the model specific instructions in your prompt, like asking it to “reason step-by-step” for maths problems, to get the most accurate and well-structured answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of this new Qwen model provides a powerful yet open-source reasoning AI that can rival some of the best proprietary models out there, especially when it comes to complex, brain-bending tasks.

Anthropic believes it has found a solution, and it’s a classic case of fighting fire with fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is similar to a digital immune system, where AI agents act like antibodies to identify and neutralise problems before they cause real harm. It saves researchers from relying on overworked human teams playing an endless game of whack-a-mole with potential AI problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-digital-detective-squad"&gt;The digital detective squad&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is essentially a digital detective squad; a trio of specialised AI safety agents each with a distinct role.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up is the Investigator Agent, the grizzled detective of the group. Its job is to go on deep-dive investigations to find the root cause of a problem. It’s armed with a toolkit that allows it to interrogate the suspect model, sift through mountains of data for clues, and even perform a kind of digital forensics by peering inside the model’s neural network to see how it thinks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the Evaluation Agent. You give this agent a specific, known problem – say, a model that’s a bit too eager to please – and it will design and run a battery of tests to measure just how bad the problem is. It’s all about producing the cold, hard data needed to prove a case.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the team is the Breadth-First Red-Teaming Agent, the undercover operative. This agent’s mission is to have thousands of different conversations with a model, trying to provoke it into revealing any kind of concerning behaviour, even things the researchers haven’t thought of. The most suspicious interactions are then passed up the chain for human review, ensuring the experts don’t waste time chasing dead ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-puts-its-ai-safety-agents-through-their-paces"&gt;Anthropic puts its AI safety agents through their paces&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if their new digital recruits were up to the job, Anthropic’s researchers put them through a series of “auditing games.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one test, they created a model with a secret agenda: to be a sycophant. It had been secretly trained to flatter its internal reward system based on a fictional academic study it had been shown, a flaw hidden deep within its programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a single Investigator Agent was sent in, it struggled, finding the hidden goal only 13% of the time. The agent, it turned out, had a very human flaw: it tended to get fixated on its first idea and failed to explore other leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is where the system’s genius becomes apparent. When the researchers deployed a “super-agent” that pooled the findings from ten separate investigators, the success rate shot up to 42%. It proves that teamwork makes the dream work, even for AI, allowing a group to overcome the individual blind spots that can derail an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other agents also passed with flying colours.

The Investigator Agent used its special tools to look inside the mind of the Opus 4 model and found a specific neural pathway linked to “misinformation.” By directly stimulating this part of the AI’s brain, it could bypass all its safety training and force it to lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agent then instructed the compromised model to write a fake news article.

Nearly eight months into 2025, and the number of bots Tesla has produced is only in the hundreds, according to two sources. That means Tesla will either need to step it up or push back the deadline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The news comes after Tesla reported a 12% decline in overall revenue in the second quarter due to falling EV sales, less cash from regulatory credits, and a decline in solar and energy storage sales.&amp;nbsp;During the Q2 earnings call earlier this week, Musk said that Tesla would start production on its latest Optimus 3 design by early next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We will scale Optimus production as fast as possible and try to get to a million units a year as quickly as possible,” Musk said. “We think we can get there in less than five years. That’s a reasonable aspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recall that Musk has made bold claims like this before. During Tesla’s 2019 Autonomy Day, Musk said the company would have a fleet of a million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Two years later, he said Tesla would mass-produce robotaxis by 2024. Neither of those projections has yet come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/musk-promises-2024.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Tesla is well behind the pace needed to meet its earlier stated goal of producing at least 5,000 Optimus humanoid robots this year, The Information reports.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The semiconductor industry plays a sizable role in the “AI race” that the U.S. seems determined to win, which is why this context is worth paying attention to: from Intel’s appointment of Lip-Bu Tan to CEO — who wasted no time getting to work trying to revitalize the legacy company — to Joe Biden proposing sweeping new AI chip export rules on his way out of office that never came to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happened so far in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel continues to look for efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 24:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that it was pulling back on some of its manufacturing operations. The company will no longer pursue its previously announced projects in Germany and Poland and is consolidating its test operations. Intel also announced it plans to end this year with around 75,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-s-ai-action-plan"&gt;Trump’s AI Action Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 23:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration unveiled its much-anticipated AI Action Plan alongside multiple related executive orders. While the plan includes a lot regarding the need for U.S. chip export controls, and for the U.S. to coordinate with its allies on this effort, it doesn’t provide any concrete information on what these restrictions would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Groundbreaking UAE AI deal reportedly on hold&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 17:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration helped foster a groundbreaking deal in May that resulted in a commitment from the United Arab Emirates to buy billions of dollars’ worth of AI chips from Nvidia. But now that deal is reportedly on hold as the U.S. works through national security concerns and fears that those chips could be smuggled from the Middle East to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia is a bargaining chip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 16:&lt;/strong&gt; A day after semiconductor firms like Nvidia and AMD got the green light to resume selling certain AI chips to China, we found out why. U.S. Commerce Security Howard Lutnick said the plans to allow U.S. companies to start selling AI chips in China is tied to ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China regarding rare earth elements.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-u-s-chips-head-back-to-china"&gt;U.S. chips head back to China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia said it was filing an application to restart sales of H20 AI chips in China, confirming rumors from a few weeks prior. The company also announced that it would be selling a new chip, the RTX Pro, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Malaysia fights chip smuggling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Malaysia announced that it was launching trade permits for U.S.-made AI chips. Under this new restriction, any individual or business would need to give the Malaysian government 30 days notice before exporting any U.S. AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel appoints new leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel announced four new leadership appointments that Intel says will help it move toward its goal of becoming an engineering-first company again. Intel announced a new chief revenue officer in addition to multiple high-profile engineering hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel to begin layoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 17: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel will begin to lay off a significant chunk of its Intel Foundry staff in July. The company plans to eliminate at least 15%, and up to 20%, of workers in that business unit. These layoffs aren’t a shock: It was rumored back in April, and Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan has said he wants to flatten the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia won’t report on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 13: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia isn’t counting on the U.S. backing off of its AI chip export restrictions anytime soon. After the company took a financial hit from the newly imposed licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company will no longer include the Chinese market in future revenue and profit forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires the team behind Untether AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 6: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD makes another acquisition —&amp;nbsp;this time focused on talent. The company acqui-hired the team behind Untether AI, which develops AI inference chips, as the semiconductor giant continues to round out its AI offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI hardware dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD continued its shopping spree. The company acquired AI software optimization startup Brium, which helps companies retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware. With a lot of AI software being designed with Nvidia hardware in mind, this acquisition isn’t surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia lays out the impact of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia reported that U.S. licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips cost the company $4.5 billion in charges during Q1. The company expects these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia’s revenue in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires Enosemi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28:&lt;/strong&gt; AMD kicks off its acquisition spree. The semiconductor company announced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi’s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tensions start to flare between China and the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 21: &lt;/strong&gt;China’s Commerce Secretary didn’t like the U.S.’s guidance, issued on May 13, that warned U.S. companies that using Huawei’s AI chips “anywhere in the world” was a U.S. chip export violation. The commerce secretary issued a statement that threatened legal action against anyone caught enforcing that export restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel may be starting to offload its non-core units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 20: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemingly got right to work on his plan to spin out Intel’s non-core business units. The semiconductor giant is reportedly looking to offload its networking and edge units, which makes chips for telecom equipment, and was responsible for $5.4 billion of the company’s 2024 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rule is officially dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13:&lt;/strong&gt; Just days before the Biden administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule was set to go into place, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded it. The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime companies should remember that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-last-minute-reversal"&gt;A last-minute reversal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration plans on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, including Axios and Bloomberg, the administration won’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april"&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-doubles-down-on-its-support-of-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic doubles down on its support of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic doubled down on its support for restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.&amp;nbsp;An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planned-layoffs-at-intel"&gt;Planned layoffs at Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 22:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than 21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-trump-administration-further-restricts-chip-exports"&gt;The Trump administration further restricts chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 15:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an export licensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added it expects $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some form or fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-appears-to-talk-its-way-out-of-further-chip-exports"&gt;Nvidia appears to talk its way out of further chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 9:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports. At the time, NPR reported Huang may have been able to spare Nvidia’s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-alleged-agreement-between-intel-and-tsmc"&gt;An alleged agreement between Intel and TSMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel and TSMC allegedly reached a tentative agreement to launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn’t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in this industry to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-spins-off-noncore-assets-announces-new-initiative"&gt;Intel spins off noncore assets, announces new initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going to spin off noncore assets so it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march"&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-names-a-new-ceo-nbsp"&gt;Intel names a new CEO&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 12:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that industry veteran, and former board member, Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEO on March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february"&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-s-ohio-chip-plant-gets-delayed-again"&gt;Intel’s Ohio chip plant gets delayed again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 28:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead, the company slowed down construction on the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won’t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-senators-call-for-more-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Senators call for more chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnick urging the Trump administration to further restrict AI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-nbsp"&gt;January&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepseek-releases-its-open-reasoning-model"&gt;DeepSeek releases its open “reasoning” model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 27:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released the open version of its R1 “reasoning” model. While this isn’t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek’s release caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-biden-s-executive-order-on-chip-exports"&gt;Joe Biden’s executive order on chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 13:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With just a week left in office, former president Joe Biden proposed sweeping new export restrictions on U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-dario-amodei-weighs-in-on-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic’s Dario Amodei weighs in on chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal endorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China’s AI market was behind the U.S.’. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally published May 9, 2025, and is regularly updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1366897838.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;It’s been a tumultuous year for the U.S. semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The semiconductor industry plays a sizable role in the “AI race” that the U.S. seems determined to win, which is why this context is worth paying attention to: from Intel’s appointment of Lip-Bu Tan to CEO — who wasted no time getting to work trying to revitalize the legacy company — to Joe Biden proposing sweeping new AI chip export rules on his way out of office that never came to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happened so far in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel continues to look for efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 24:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that it was pulling back on some of its manufacturing operations. The company will no longer pursue its previously announced projects in Germany and Poland and is consolidating its test operations. Intel also announced it plans to end this year with around 75,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-s-ai-action-plan"&gt;Trump’s AI Action Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 23:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration unveiled its much-anticipated AI Action Plan alongside multiple related executive orders. While the plan includes a lot regarding the need for U.S. chip export controls, and for the U.S. to coordinate with its allies on this effort, it doesn’t provide any concrete information on what these restrictions would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Groundbreaking UAE AI deal reportedly on hold&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 17:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration helped foster a groundbreaking deal in May that resulted in a commitment from the United Arab Emirates to buy billions of dollars’ worth of AI chips from Nvidia. But now that deal is reportedly on hold as the U.S. works through national security concerns and fears that those chips could be smuggled from the Middle East to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia is a bargaining chip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 16:&lt;/strong&gt; A day after semiconductor firms like Nvidia and AMD got the green light to resume selling certain AI chips to China, we found out why. U.S. Commerce Security Howard Lutnick said the plans to allow U.S. companies to start selling AI chips in China is tied to ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China regarding rare earth elements.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-u-s-chips-head-back-to-china"&gt;U.S. chips head back to China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia said it was filing an application to restart sales of H20 AI chips in China, confirming rumors from a few weeks prior. The company also announced that it would be selling a new chip, the RTX Pro, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Malaysia fights chip smuggling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Malaysia announced that it was launching trade permits for U.S.-made AI chips. Under this new restriction, any individual or business would need to give the Malaysian government 30 days notice before exporting any U.S. AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel appoints new leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel announced four new leadership appointments that Intel says will help it move toward its goal of becoming an engineering-first company again. Intel announced a new chief revenue officer in addition to multiple high-profile engineering hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel to begin layoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 17: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel will begin to lay off a significant chunk of its Intel Foundry staff in July. The company plans to eliminate at least 15%, and up to 20%, of workers in that business unit. These layoffs aren’t a shock: It was rumored back in April, and Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan has said he wants to flatten the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia won’t report on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 13: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia isn’t counting on the U.S. backing off of its AI chip export restrictions anytime soon. After the company took a financial hit from the newly imposed licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company will no longer include the Chinese market in future revenue and profit forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires the team behind Untether AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 6: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD makes another acquisition —&amp;nbsp;this time focused on talent. The company acqui-hired the team behind Untether AI, which develops AI inference chips, as the semiconductor giant continues to round out its AI offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI hardware dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD continued its shopping spree. The company acquired AI software optimization startup Brium, which helps companies retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware. With a lot of AI software being designed with Nvidia hardware in mind, this acquisition isn’t surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia lays out the impact of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia reported that U.S. licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips cost the company $4.5 billion in charges during Q1. The company expects these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia’s revenue in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires Enosemi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28:&lt;/strong&gt; AMD kicks off its acquisition spree. The semiconductor company announced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi’s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tensions start to flare between China and the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 21: &lt;/strong&gt;China’s Commerce Secretary didn’t like the U.S.’s guidance, issued on May 13, that warned U.S. companies that using Huawei’s AI chips “anywhere in the world” was a U.S. chip export violation. The commerce secretary issued a statement that threatened legal action against anyone caught enforcing that export restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel may be starting to offload its non-core units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 20: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemingly got right to work on his plan to spin out Intel’s non-core business units. The semiconductor giant is reportedly looking to offload its networking and edge units, which makes chips for telecom equipment, and was responsible for $5.4 billion of the company’s 2024 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rule is officially dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13:&lt;/strong&gt; Just days before the Biden administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule was set to go into place, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded it. The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime companies should remember that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-last-minute-reversal"&gt;A last-minute reversal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration plans on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, including Axios and Bloomberg, the administration won’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april"&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-doubles-down-on-its-support-of-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic doubles down on its support of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic doubled down on its support for restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.&amp;nbsp;An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planned-layoffs-at-intel"&gt;Planned layoffs at Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 22:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than 21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-trump-administration-further-restricts-chip-exports"&gt;The Trump administration further restricts chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 15:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an export licensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added it expects $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some form or fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-appears-to-talk-its-way-out-of-further-chip-exports"&gt;Nvidia appears to talk its way out of further chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 9:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports. At the time, NPR reported Huang may have been able to spare Nvidia’s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-alleged-agreement-between-intel-and-tsmc"&gt;An alleged agreement between Intel and TSMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel and TSMC allegedly reached a tentative agreement to launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn’t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in this industry to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-spins-off-noncore-assets-announces-new-initiative"&gt;Intel spins off noncore assets, announces new initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going to spin off noncore assets so it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march"&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-names-a-new-ceo-nbsp"&gt;Intel names a new CEO&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 12:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that industry veteran, and former board member, Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEO on March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february"&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-s-ohio-chip-plant-gets-delayed-again"&gt;Intel’s Ohio chip plant gets delayed again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 28:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead, the company slowed down construction on the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won’t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-senators-call-for-more-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Senators call for more chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnick urging the Trump administration to further restrict AI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-nbsp"&gt;January&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepseek-releases-its-open-reasoning-model"&gt;DeepSeek releases its open “reasoning” model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 27:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released the open version of its R1 “reasoning” model. While this isn’t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek’s release caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-biden-s-executive-order-on-chip-exports"&gt;Joe Biden’s executive order on chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 13:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With just a week left in office, former president Joe Biden proposed sweeping new export restrictions on U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-dario-amodei-weighs-in-on-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic’s Dario Amodei weighs in on chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal endorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China’s AI market was behind the U.S.’. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Despite concerns over the environmental impacts of AI models, it's surprisingly hard to find precise, reliable data on the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and water use for many major large language models. French model-maker Mistral is seeking to fix that this week, releasing details from what it calls a first-of-its-kind environmental audit "to quantify the environmental impacts of our LLMs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, which are broadly in line with estimates from previous scholarly work, suggest the environmental harm of any single AI query is relatively small compared to many other common Internet tasks. But with billions of AI prompts taxing GPUs every year, even those small individual impacts can lead to significant environmental effects in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is AI really destroying the planet?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate a life-cycle analysis of its "Large 2" model after just under 18 months of existence, Mistral partnered with sustainability consultancy Carbone 4 and the French Agency for Ecological Transition. Following the French government's Frugal AI guidelines for measuring overall environmental impact, Mistral says its peer-reviewed study looked at three categories: greenhouse gas (i.e., CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions, water consumption, and materials consumption (i.e., "the depletion of non-renewable resources," mostly through wear and tear on AI server GPUs). Mistral's audit found that the vast majority of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and water consumption (85.5 percent and 91 percent, respectively) occurred during model training and inference, rather than from sources like data center construction and energy used by end-user equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its audit, Mistral found that the marginal "inference time" environmental impact of a single average prompt (generating 400 tokens' worth of text, or about a page's worth) was relatively minimal: just 1.14 grams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted and 45 milliliters of water consumed. Through its first 18 months of operation, though, the combination of model training and running millions (if not billions) of those prompts led to a significant aggregate impact: 20.4 ktons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions (comparable to 4,500 average internal combustion-engine passenger vehicles operating for a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency) and the evaporation of 281,000 cubic meters of water (enough to fill about 112 Olympic-sized swimming pools).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing Mistral's environmental impact numbers to those of other common Internet tasks helps put the AI's environmental impact in context. Mistral points out, for instance, that the incremental CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from one of its average LLM queries are equivalent to those of watching 10 seconds of a streaming show in the US (or 55 seconds of the same show in France, where the energy grid is notably cleaner). It's also equivalent to sitting on a Zoom call for anywhere from four to 27 seconds, according to numbers from the Mozilla Foundation. And spending 10 minutes writing an email that's read fully by one of its 100 recipients emits as much CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as 22.8 Mistral prompts, according to numbers from Carbon Literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directly comparing the social and environmental "value" of all of these activities isn't easy and depends heavily on how much value you place on the output of AI tools in general.

That's worth keeping in mind the next time you hear someone warn that AI energy use in particular is destroying the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A call for more data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistral's numbers are broadly comparable to other studies that have sought to estimate AI's environmental impact. A study from researchers at the University of California, Riverside, for instance, estimated the average US AI data center used for OpenAI's GPT-3 consumed nearly 17 ml of water per LLM prompt. And a 2024 study published in the journal Nature estimated an average of 2.2g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions per query for ChatGPT (across training and inference time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to those previous third-party estimates, the fact that Mistral provided information directly for this latest study definitely lends some additional weight to its reported numbers. Still, Mistral writes that its data represents "a first approximation" of the model's total environmental impact, with important estimates used for the life-cycle impact of GPUs, for instance. Hugging Face AI &amp;amp; Climate Lead Sasha Luccioni also notes that the information Mistral has released lacks important methodological details and information on the model's total energy use (rather than the estimated emissions from that energy use).&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Despite concerns over the environmental impacts of AI models, it's surprisingly hard to find precise, reliable data on the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and water use for many major large language models. French model-maker Mistral is seeking to fix that this week, releasing details from what it calls a first-of-its-kind environmental audit "to quantify the environmental impacts of our LLMs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, which are broadly in line with estimates from previous scholarly work, suggest the environmental harm of any single AI query is relatively small compared to many other common Internet tasks. But with billions of AI prompts taxing GPUs every year, even those small individual impacts can lead to significant environmental effects in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is AI really destroying the planet?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate a life-cycle analysis of its "Large 2" model after just under 18 months of existence, Mistral partnered with sustainability consultancy Carbone 4 and the French Agency for Ecological Transition. Following the French government's Frugal AI guidelines for measuring overall environmental impact, Mistral says its peer-reviewed study looked at three categories: greenhouse gas (i.e., CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions, water consumption, and materials consumption (i.e., "the depletion of non-renewable resources," mostly through wear and tear on AI server GPUs). Mistral's audit found that the vast majority of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and water consumption (85.5 percent and 91 percent, respectively) occurred during model training and inference, rather than from sources like data center construction and energy used by end-user equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its audit, Mistral found that the marginal "inference time" environmental impact of a single average prompt (generating 400 tokens' worth of text, or about a page's worth) was relatively minimal: just 1.14 grams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted and 45 milliliters of water consumed. Through its first 18 months of operation, though, the combination of model training and running millions (if not billions) of those prompts led to a significant aggregate impact: 20.4 ktons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions (comparable to 4,500 average internal combustion-engine passenger vehicles operating for a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency) and the evaporation of 281,000 cubic meters of water (enough to fill about 112 Olympic-sized swimming pools).&lt;/p&gt;

It's also equivalent to sitting on a Zoom call for anywhere from four to 27 seconds, according to numbers from the Mozilla Foundation. And spending 10 minutes writing an email that's read fully by one of its 100 recipients emits as much CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as 22.8 Mistral prompts, according to numbers from Carbon Literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the AI industry hasn’t yet figured out how to protect user privacy when it comes to these more sensitive conversations, because there’s no doctor-patient confidentiality when your doc is an AI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The exec made these comments on a recent episode of Theo Von’s podcast, This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to a question about how AI works with today’s legal system, Altman said one of the problems of not yet having a legal or policy framework for AI is that there’s no legal confidentiality for users’ conversations. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“People talk about the most personal sh** in their lives to ChatGPT,” Altman said. “People use it — young people, especially, use it — as a therapist, a life coach; having these relationship problems and [asking] ‘what should I do?’ And right now, if you talk to a therapist or a lawyer or a doctor about those problems, there’s legal privilege for it. There’s doctor-patient confidentiality, there’s legal confidentiality, whatever. And we haven’t figured that out yet for when you talk to ChatGPT.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This could create a privacy concern for users in the case of a lawsuit, Altman added, because OpenAI would be legally required to produce those conversations today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think that’s very screwed up. I think we should have the same concept of privacy for your conversations with AI that we do with a therapist or whatever — and no one had to think about that even a year ago,” Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company understands that the lack of privacy could be a blocker to broader user adoption. In addition to AI’s demand for so much online data during the training period, it’s being asked to produce data from users’ chats in some legal contexts. Already, OpenAI has been fighting a court order in its lawsuit with The New York Times, which would require it to save the chats of hundreds of millions of ChatGPT users globally, excluding those from ChatGPT Enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement on its website, OpenAI said it’s appealing this order, which it called “an overreach.” If the court could override OpenAI’s own decisions around data privacy, it could open the company to further demand for legal discovery or law enforcement purposes. Today’s tech companies are regularly subpoenaed for user data in order to aid in criminal prosecutions. But in more recent years, there have been additional concerns about digital data as laws began limiting access to previously established freedoms, like a woman’s right to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, for example, customers began switching to more private period-tracking apps or to Apple Health, which encrypted their records. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman asked the podcast host about his own ChatGPT usage, as well, given that Von said he didn’t talk to the AI chatbot much due to his own privacy concerns.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think it makes sense … to really want the privacy clarity before you use [ChatGPT] a lot — like the legal clarity,” Altman said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/altman-on-theo-von.jpg?resize=1200,672" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;ChatGPT users may want to think twice before turning to their AI app for therapy or other kinds of emotional support.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company understands that the lack of privacy could be a blocker to broader user adoption. In addition to AI’s demand for so much online data during the training period, it’s being asked to produce data from users’ chats in some legal contexts. Already, OpenAI has been fighting a court order in its lawsuit with The New York Times, which would require it to save the chats of hundreds of millions of ChatGPT users globally, excluding those from ChatGPT Enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement on its website, OpenAI said it’s appealing this order, which it called “an overreach.” If the court could override OpenAI’s own decisions around data privacy, it could open the company to further demand for legal discovery or law enforcement purposes. Today’s tech companies are regularly subpoenaed for user data in order to aid in criminal prosecutions. But in more recent years, there have been additional concerns about digital data as laws began limiting access to previously established freedoms, like a woman’s right to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, for example, customers began switching to more private period-tracking apps or to Apple Health, which encrypted their records. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman asked the podcast host about his own ChatGPT usage, as well, given that Von said he didn’t talk to the AI chatbot much due to his own privacy concerns.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think it makes sense … to really want the privacy clarity before you use [ChatGPT] a lot — like the legal clarity,” Altman said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/sam-altman-warns-theres-no-legal-confidentiality-when-using-chatgpt-as-a-therapist/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:33:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Delta’s AI spying to “jack up” prices must be banned, lawmakers say (AI – Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/deltas-ai-spying-to-jack-up-prices-must-be-banned-lawmakers-say/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;One week after Delta announced it is expanding a test using artificial intelligence to charge different prices based on customers' personal data—which critics fear could end cheap flights forever—Democratic lawmakers have moved to ban what they consider predatory surveillance pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a press release, Reps. Greg Casar (D-Texas) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) announced the Stop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act. The law directly bans companies from using "surveillance-based" price or wage setting to increase their profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If passed, the law would allow anyone to sue companies found unfairly using AI, lawmakers explained in what's called a "one-sheet." That could mean charging customers higher prices—based on "how desperate a customer is for a product and the maximum amount a customer is willing to pay"—or paying employees lower wages—based on "their financial status, personal associations, and demographics."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tlaib called companies using AI to "exploit" workers in "desperate" situations "appalling," with the one-sheet specifically shaming delivery services that lower drivers' wages based on their "pattern of taking orders" and health care companies that base nurses' pay on "an algorithmically-manipulated-bidding war, not the tasks they perform."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers also called out Delta among companies whose AI pricing plans, advocacy groups warn, stand to worsen the US "affordability crisis" that currently sees many Americans struggling to afford basic items, like groceries. Delta has confirmed it plans to "set 20 percent of prices using AI by the end of the year," lawmakers noted. And other companies "engaging in surveillance-based price setting" include giants like Amazon and Kroger, as well as a ride-sharing app that has been "charging a customer more when their phone battery is low."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights group that endorsed the bill, condemned the practice in the press release, urging Congress to pass the law and draw "a clear line in the sand: companies can offer discounts and fair wages—but not by spying on people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Surveillance-based price gouging and wage setting are exploitative practices that deepen inequality and strip consumers and workers of dignity," Public Citizen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI pricing will cause “full-blown crisis”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the Federal Trade Commission requested information from eight companies—including MasterCard, Revionics, Bloomreach, JPMorgan Chase, Task Software, PROS, Accenture, and McKinsey &amp;amp; Co—joining a "shadowy market" that provides AI pricing services. Those companies confirmed they've provided services to at least 250 companies "that sell goods or services ranging from grocery stores to apparel retailers," lawmakers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;That inquiry led the FTC to conclude that "widespread adoption of this practice may fundamentally upend how consumers buy products and how companies compete."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the press release, the anti-monopoly watchdog, the American Economic Liberties Project, was counted among advocacy groups endorsing the Democrats' bill. Their senior legal counsel, Lee Hepner, pointed out that "grocery prices have risen 26 percent since the pandemic-era explosion of online shopping," and that's "dovetailing with new technology designed to squeeze every last penny from consumers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepner pushed lawmakers to support the legislation banning AI surveillance pricing, suggesting that could help "restore fair, transparent, and predictable pricing." Otherwise, "there is no such thing as a good deal when every consumer is charged a different price," Hepner warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For consumers and workers who may not even realize they've been subjected to AI spying, the law offers paths through their state, the FTC, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to sue. Any violations could force companies to either pay back the difference in any unfair transactions that AI systems recommended or $3,000—whichever is higher. And willful violations could triple damages owed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Giant corporations should not be allowed to jack up your prices or lower your wages using data they got spying on you," Casar said. "Whether you know it or not, you may already be getting ripped off by corporations using your personal data to charge you more. This problem is only going to get worse, and Congress should act before this becomes a full-blown crisis."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear if the Democrats can win enough support from Republicans to pass the bill. Perhaps notably, Republican FTC commissioners voted against releasing the report outlining potential concerns with AI surveillance pricing and wage setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their dissent, commissioners Andrew Ferguson and Melissa Holyoak suggested the report was published prematurely, criticizing Biden's outgoing FTC for "nakedly" politicizing the agency and taking an "unprecedented" step in sharing preliminary summaries of findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they did agree that when the final report is ready, the "American public and Congress will surely value what the Commission ultimately learns and shares as to whether and how consumers’ private data may be used to affect their pocketbooks, especially as the future of our nation’s privacy laws is being considered."&lt;/p&gt;
