            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Olympic figure skating looks effortless. Athletes sail across the ice, then soar into the air, spinning like a top, before landing on a single blade just 4-5 millimeters wide. To help figure skaters land quadruple axels, Salchows, Lutzes, and maybe even the elusive quintuple without looking the least bit stressed, Jerry Lu MFin ’24 developed an optical tracking system called &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;OOFSkate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; that uses artificial intelligence to analyze video of a figure skater’s jump and make recommendations on how to improve. Lu, a former researcher at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Sports Lab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, has been aiding elite skaters on Team USA with their technical performance and will be working with NBC Sports during the 2026 Winter Olympics to help commentators and TV viewers make better sense of the complex scoring system in figure skating, snowboarding, and skiing. He’ll be applying AI technologies to explain nuanced judging decisions and demonstrate just how technically challenging these sports can be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, Professor Anette “Peko” Hosoi, co-founder and faculty director of the MIT Sports Lab, is embarking on new research aimed at understanding how AI systems evaluate aesthetic performance in figure skating. Hosoi and Lu recently chatted with&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; about applying AI to sports, whether AI systems could ever be used to judge Olympic figure skating, and when we might see a skater land a quint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why apply AI to figure skating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lu:&lt;/strong&gt; Skaters can always keep pushing, higher, faster, stronger. OOFSkate is all about helping skaters figure out a way to rotate a little bit faster in their jumps or jump a little bit higher. The system helps skaters catch things that perhaps could pass an eye test, but that might allow them to target some high-value areas of opportunity. The artistic side of skating is much harder to evaluate than the technical elements because it’s subjective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use mobile training app, you just need to take a video of an athlete’s jump, and it will spit out the physical metrics that drive how many rotations you can do. It tracks those metrics and builds in all of the other current elite and former elite athletes. You can see your data and then see, “This is how an Olympic champion did this element, perhaps I should try that.” You get the comparison and the automated classifier, which shows you if you did this trick at World Championships and it were judged by an international panel, this is approximately the grade of execution score they would give you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosoi:&lt;/strong&gt; There are a lot of AI tools that are coming online, especially things like pose estimators, where you can approximate skeletal configurations from video. The challenge with these pose estimators is that if you only have one camera angle, they do very well in the plane of the camera, but they do very poorly with depth. For example, if you’re trying to critique somebody’s form in fencing, and they’re moving toward the camera, you get very bad data. But with figure skating, Jerry has found one of the few areas where depth challenges don’t really matter. In figure skating, you need to understand: How high did this person jump, how many times did they go around, and how well did they land? None of those rely on depth. He’s found an application that pose estimators do really well, and that doesn’t pay a penalty for the things they do badly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Could you ever see a world in which AI is used to evaluate the artistic side of figure skating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosoi:&lt;/strong&gt; When it comes to AI and aesthetic evaluation, we have new work underway thanks to a MIT Human Insight Collaborative (MITHIC) grant. This work is in collaboration with Professor Arthur Bahr and IDSS graduate student Eric Liu. When you ask an AI platform for an aesthetic evaluation such as “What do you think of this painting?” it will respond with something that sounds like it came from a human. What we want to understand is, to get to that assessment, are the AIs going through the same sort of reasoning pathways or using the same intuitive concepts that humans go through to arrive at, “I like that painting,” or “I don’t like that painting”? Or are they just parrots? Are they just mimicking what they heard a person say? Or is there some concept map of aesthetic appeal? Figure skating is a perfect place to look for this map because skating is aesthetically judged. And there are numbers. You can’t go around a museum and find scores, “This painting is a 35.” But in skating, you’ve got the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings up another even more interesting question, which is the difference between novices and experts. It’s known that expert humans and novice humans will react differently to seeing the same thing. Somebody who is an expert judge may have a different opinion of a skating performance than a member of the general population. We’re trying to understand differences between reactions from experts, novices, and AI. Do these reactions have some common ground in where they are coming from, or is the AI coming from a different place than both the expert and the novice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lu:&lt;/strong&gt; Figure skating is interesting because everybody working in the field of AI is trying to figure out AGI or artificial general intelligence and trying to build this extremely sound AI that replicates human beings. Working on applying AI to sports like figure skating helps us understand how humans think and approach judging. This has down-the-line impacts for AI research and companies that are developing AI models. By gaining a deeper understanding of how current state-of-the-art AI models work with these sports, and how you need to do training and fine-tuning of these models to make them work for specific sports, it helps you understand how AI needs to advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What will you be watching for in the Milan Cortina Olympics figure skating competitions, now that you’ve been studying and working in this area? Do you think someone will land a quint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lu:&lt;/strong&gt; For the winter games, I am working with NBC for the figure skating, ski, and snowboarding competitions to help them tell a data-driven story for the American people. The goal is to make these sports more relatable. Skating looks slow on television, but it’s not. Everything is supposed to look effortless. If it looks hard, you are probably going to get penalized. Skaters need to learn how to spin very fast, jump extremely high, float in the air, and land beautifully on one foot. The data we are gathering can help showcase how hard skating actually is, even though it is supposed to look easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m glad we are working in the Olympics sports realm because the world watches once every four years, and it is traditionally coaching-intensive and talent-driven sports, unlike a sport like baseball, where if you don’t have an elite-level optical tracking system you are not maximizing the value that you currently have. I’m glad we get to work with these Olympic sports and athletes and make an impact here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosoi:&lt;/strong&gt; I have always watched Olympic figure skating competitions, ever since I could turn on the TV. They’re always incredible. One of the things that I’m going to be practicing is identifying the jumps, which is very hard to do if you’re an amateur “judge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have also done some back-of-the-envelope calculations to see if a quint is possible. I am now totally convinced it’s possible. We will see one in our lifetime, if not relatively soon. Not in this Olympics, but soon. When I saw we were so close on the quint, I thought, what about six? Can we do six rotations? Probably not. That’s where we start to come up against the limits of human physical capability. But five, I think, is in reach.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s that AI will save you from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s the version the industry has spent the last three years selling to millions of nervous people who are eager to buy it. Yes, some white-collar jobs will disappear. But for most other roles, the argument goes, AI is a force multiplier. You become a more capable, more indispensable lawyer, consultant, writer, coder, financial analyst — and so on. The tools work for you, you work less hard, everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But a new study published in Harvard Business Review follows that premise to its actual conclusion, and what it finds there isn’t a productivity revolution. It finds companies are at risk of becoming burnout machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of what they describe as “in-progress research,” UC Berkeley researchers spent eight months inside a 200-person tech company watching what happened when workers genuinely embraced AI. What they found across more than 40 “in-depth” interviews was that nobody was pressured at this company. Nobody was told to hit new targets. People just started doing more because the tools made more feel doable. But because they could do these things, work began bleeding into lunch breaks and late evenings. The employees’ to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As one engineer told them, “You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less. But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over on the tech industry forum Hacker News, one commenter had the same reaction, writing, “I feel this. Since my team has jumped into an AI everything working style, expectations have tripled, stress has tripled and actual productivity has only gone up by maybe 10%. It feels like leadership is putting immense pressure on everyone to prove their investment in AI is worth it and we all feel the pressure to try to show them it is while actually having to work longer hours to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s fascinating and also alarming. The argument about AI and work has always stalled on the same question — are the gains real? But too few have stopped to ask what happens when they are.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The researchers’ new findings aren’t entirely novel. A separate trial last summer found experienced developers using AI tools took 19% longer on tasks while believing they were 20% faster. Around the same time, a National Bureau of Economic Research study tracking AI adoption across thousands of workplaces found that productivity gains amounted to just 3% in time savings, with no significant impact on earnings or hours worked in any occupation. Both studies have gotten picked apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This one may be harder to dismiss because it doesn’t challenge the premise that AI can augment what employees can do on their own. It confirms it, then shows where all that augmentation actually leads, which is “fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,” according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The industry bet that helping people do more would be the answer to everything, but it may turn out to be the beginning of a different problem entirely. The research is worth reading, here.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1158287360-e1665956231123.jpg?resize=1200,676" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The most seductive narrative in American work culture right now isn’t that AI will take your job.

The challenge isn’t just access; it’s making those rare interactions count with intelligence that’s currently trapped in data silos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The fragmented intelligence problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Briggs Davidson, senior director of digital, data &amp;amp; marketing strategy for life Sciences at Capgemini Invent, outlines a scenario that will sound familiar to anyone in pharma marketing: An HCP attends a conference where a competitor showcases promising drug results, publishes research, and shifts their prescriptions to a rival product – in a single quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In most companies, legacy IT infrastructure and data silos keep this information in disparate systems in CRM, events databases and claims data,” Davidson writes. “Chances are, none of that information was accessible to sales reps before they met with the HCP.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution, according to Davidson, isn’t to connect these systems, it’s deploying agentic AI in healthcare marketing to autonomously query, synthesising and acting on unified data. Unlike conversational AI that responds to queries, agentic systems can independently execute multi-step tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of a data engineer building a new pipeline, an AI agent could autonomously query the CRM and claims database to answer business questions like: “Identify oncologists in the Northwest who have a 20% lower prescription volume but attended our last medical congress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From orchestration to autonomous execution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davidson frames the change as moving from an “omnichannel view” – coordinating experiences in channels – to true orchestration powered by agentic AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means a sales representative could have an agent assist with call and visit planning by asking: “What messages has my HCP responded to most recently?” or “Can you create a detailed intelligence brief on my HCP?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agentic system would compile:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their most recent conversation with the HCP,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The HCP’s prescribing behaviour,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thought-leaders the HCP follows,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relevant content to share,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The HCP’s preferred outreach channels (in-person visits, emails, webinars).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More significantly, the AI agent would then create a custom call plan for each HCP based on their unified profile and recommend follow-up steps based on engagement outcomes. “Agentic AI systems are about driving action, graduating from ‘answer my prompt,’ to ‘autonomously execute my task,'” Davidson explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That means evolving the sales representative mindset from asking questions to coordinating small teams of specialised agents that work together: one plans, another retrieves and checks content, a third schedules and measures, and a fourth enforces compliance guardrails – all under human oversight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The AI-ready data prerequisite&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operational promise hinges on what Davidson calls “AI-ready data” – standardised, accessible, complete, and trustworthy information that enables three abilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster decision making: &lt;/strong&gt;Predictive analytics that provide near real-time alerts on what’s about to happen, letting sales representatives act proactively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalisation at scale: &lt;/strong&gt;Delivering customised experiences to thousands of HCPs simultaneously with small human teams enabled by specialised agent networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True marketing ROI:&lt;/strong&gt; Moving beyond monthly historical reports to understanding which marketing activities are actively driving prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davidson emphasises that successful deployment starts with marketing and IT alignment on initial use cases, with stakeholders identifying KPIs that demonstrate tangible outcomes – like specific percentage increases in HCP engagement or sales representative productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Critical implementation questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article frames agentic AI in healthcare as “not simply another technology-led ability; it’s a new operating layer for commercial teams.” But it acknowledges that “agentic AI’s full value only materialises with AI-ready data, trustworthy deployment and workflow redesign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What remains unaddressed is the regulatory and compliance complexity of autonomous systems querying claims databases containing prescriber behaviour, particularly under HIPAA’s minimum necessary standard. The piece also doesn’t detail actual client implementations or metrics beyond the aspirational US$450B economic value projection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For global organisations, Davidson says use cases “can and should be tailored to fit each market’s maturity for maximum ROI,” suggesting that deployment will vary in regulatory environments. The fundamental value proposition, according to Davidson, centres on bidirectional benefit: “The HCP receives directly relevant content, and the marketing teams can drive increased HCP engagement and conversion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that vision of autonomous marketing agents coordinating in CRM, events, and claims systems becomes standard practice by 2028 – or remains constrained by data governance realities – will likely determine if life sciences achieves anything close to that US$450 billion opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: China’s hyperscalers bet billions on agentic AI as commerce becomes the new battleground&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncentre size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111908" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
