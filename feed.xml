At the Keck Observatory, in Hawaii, just as many segments make up a mirror that spans 33 feet, reflecting images of uncharted worlds for her to study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jensen-Clem, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, works with the Keck Observatory to figure out how to detect new planets without leaving our own. Typically, this pursuit faces an array of obstacles: Wind, fluctuations in atmospheric density and temperature, or even a misaligned telescope mirror can create a glare from a star’s light that obscures the view of what’s around it, rendering any planets orbiting the star effectively invisible. And what light Earth’s atmosphere doesn’t obscure, it absorbs. That’s why researchers who study these distant worlds often work with space telescopes that circumvent Earth’s pesky atmosphere entirely, such as the $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there’s another way over these hurdles. At her lab among the redwoods, Jensen-Clem and her students experiment with new technologies and software to help Keck’s primary honeycomb mirror and its smaller, “deformable” mirror see more clearly. Using measurements from atmospheric sensors, deformable mirrors are designed to adjust shape rapidly, so they can correct for distortions caused by Earth’s atmosphere on the fly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This general imaging technique, called adaptive optics, has been common practice since the 1990s. But Jensen-Clem is looking to level up the game with extreme adaptive optics technologies, which are aimed to create the highest image quality over a small field of view. Her group, in particular, does so by tackling issues involving wind or the primary mirror itself. The goal is to focus starlight so precisely that a planet can be visible even if its host star is a million to a billion times brighter.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In April, she and her former collaborator Maaike van Kooten were named co-recipients of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation’s New Horizons in Physics Prize. The prize announcement says they earned this early-career research award for their potential “to enable the direct detection of the smallest exo­planets” through a repertoire of methods the two women have spent their careers developing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In July, Jensen-Clem was also announced as a member of a new committee for the Habitable Worlds Observatory, a concept for a NASA space telescope that would spend its career on the prowl for signs of life in the universe. She’s tasked with defining the mission’s scientific goals by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Keck Observatory’s 10-meter primary mirror features a honeycomb structure with 36 individual mirror segments." class="wp-image-1125204" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Web_Keck-Primary-Mirror-Ethan-Tweedie.jpg?w=1800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Keck Observatory’s 10-meter primary mirror features a honeycomb structure with 36 individual mirror segments.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ETHAN TWEEDIE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In adaptive optics, we spend a lot of time on simulations, or in the lab,” Jensen-Clem says. “It’s been a long road to see that I’ve actually made things better at the observatory in the past few years.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jensen-Clem has long appreciated astronomy for its more mind-bending qualities. In seventh grade, she became fascinated by how time slows down near a black hole when her dad, an aerospace engineer, explained that concept to her. After starting her bachelor’s degree at MIT in 2008, she became taken with how a distant star can seem to disappear—either suddenly winking out or gently fading away, depending on the kind of object that passes in front of it. “It wasn’t quite exoplanet science, but there was a lot of overlap,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If you just look up at the night sky and see stars twinkling, it’s happening fast. So we have to go fast too.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During this time, Jensen-Clem began sowing the seeds for one of her prize-winning methods after her teaching assistant recommended that she apply for an internship at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There, she worked on a setup that could perfect the orientation of a large mirror. Such mirrors are more difficult to realign than the smaller, deformable ones, whose shape-changing segments cater to Earth’s fluctuating atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“At the time, we were saying, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be really cool to install one of these at Keck Observatory?’” Jensen-Clem says. The idea stuck around. She even wrote about it in a fellowship application when she was gearing up to start her graduate work at Caltech. And after years of touch-and-go development, Jensen-Clem succeeded in installing the system—which uses a technology called a Zernike wavefront sensor—on Keck’s primary mirror about a year ago. “My work as a college intern is finally done,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The system, which is currently used for occasional recalibrations rather than continuous adjustments, includes a special kind of glass plate that bends the light rays from the mirror to reveal a specific pattern. The detector can pick up a hairbreadth misalignment in that picture: If one hexagon is pushed too far back or forward, its brightness changes. Even the tiniest misalignment is important to correct, because “when you’re studying a faint object, suddenly you’re much more susceptible to little mistakes,” Jensen-Clem says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She has also been working to perfect the craft of molding Keck’s deformable mirror. This instrument, which reflects light that’s been rerouted from the primary mirror, is much smaller—only six inches wide—and is designed to reposition as often as 2,000 times a second to combat atmospheric turbulence and create the clearest picture possible. “If you just look up at the night sky and see stars twinkling, it’s happening fast. So we have to go fast too,” Jensen-Clem says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even at this rapid rate of readjustment, there’s still a lag. The deformable mirror is usually about one millisecond behind the actual outdoor conditions at any given time. “When the [adaptive optics] system can’t keep up,&amp;nbsp;then you aren’t going to get the best resolution,” says van Kooten, Jensen-Clem’s former collaborator, who is now at the National Research Council Canada. This lag has proved especially troublesome on windy nights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jensen-Clem thought it was an unsolvable problem. “The reason we have that delay is because we need to run computations and then move the deformable mirror,” she says. “You’re never going to do those things instantaneously.”&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But while she was still a postdoc at UC Berkeley, she came across a paper that posited a solution. Its authors proposed that using previous measurements and simple algebra to predict how the atmosphere will change, rather than trying to keep up with it in real time, would yield better results. She wasn’t able to test the idea at the time, but coming to UCSC and working with Keck presented the perfect opportunity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Around this time, Jensen-Clem invited van Kooten to join her team at UCSC as a postdoc because of their shared interest in the predictive software. “I didn’t have a place to live at first, so she put me up in her guest room,” van Kooten says. “She’s just so supportive at every level.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After creating experimental software to try out at Keck, the team compared the predictive version with the more standard adaptive optics, examining how well each imaged an exoplanet without its drowning in starlight. They found that the predictive software could image even faint exoplanets two to three times more clearly. The results, which Jensen-Clem published in 2022, were part of what earned her the New Horizons in Physics Prize.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thayne Currie, an astronomer at the University of Texas, San Antonio, says that these new techniques will become especially vital as researchers build bigger and bigger ground-based facilities to capture images of exoplanets—including upcoming projects such as the Extremely Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory and the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile. “There’s an incredible amount that we’re learning&amp;nbsp;about the universe, and it is really driven by technology advances that are very, very&amp;nbsp;new,” Currie says. “Dr. Jensen-Clem’s work is an example of that kind of innovation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In May, one of Jensen-Clem’s graduate students went back to Hawaii to reinstall the predictive software at Keck. This time, the program isn’t just a trial run; it’s there to stay. The new software has shown it can refocus artificial starlight. Next, it will have to prove it can handle the real thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in about a year, Jensen-Clem and her students and colleagues will brace themselves for a flood of observations from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, which recently finished measuring the motion, temperature, and composition of billions of stars over more than a decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the project releases its next set of data—slated for December 2026—Jensen-Clem’s team aims to hunt for new exoplanetary systems using clues like the wobbles in a star’s motion caused by the gravitational tugs of planets orbiting around it. Once a system has been identified, exoplanet photographers will then be able to shoot the hidden planets using a new instrument at Keck that can reveal more about their atmospheres and temperatures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There will be a mountain of data to sort through, and an even steeper supply of starlight to refocus. Thankfully, Jensen-Clem has spent more than a decade refining just the techniques she’ll need: “This time next year,” she says, “we’ll be racing to throw all our adaptive optics tricks at these systems and detect as many of these objects as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jenna Ahart is a science journalist specializing in the physical sciences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pendant on Rebecca Jensen-Clem’s necklace is only about an inch wide, composed of 36 silver hexagons entwined in a honeycomb mosaic.

But to extract insights, there’s usually a good deal of manual work that needs to be done on raw data, either by semitechnical users (such as founders and product leaders), or dedicated – and expensive – data specialists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, to produce real value, information has to be collected, shepherded, altered, and drawn from dozens of spreadsheets and different business platforms: the organisation’s CRM, its martech stack, e-commerce system, and website data, to name a few common examples. Clearly, that’s a time consuming process, and the outcomes can be old news, rather than up-to-the-minute insights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-introducing-vibe-analytics"&gt;Introducing vibe analytics&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideal business solution would be querying real-time data using natural language (vs writing code in SQL or Python), with smart systems working in the background to correlate and parse different data sources and formats. This is vibe analysis, where users can simply ask questions in plain language and let AI do the heavy lifting. Instead of manual data-wrestling and business users spending hours uncovering insights hidden deep in datasets, they get results fast — in text, graphics, summaries, and, where needed, detailed breakdowns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast and accurate data analysis is important to every organisation, but for many, real-time insights are crucial. In the agricultural sector, for example, Lumo uses Fabi.ai’s platform to manage large fleets of IoT devices, collecting telemetry data continuously and adjusting its systems based on collated, normalised, and parsed information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using vibe analysis, Lumo sees device performance immediately, as well as trends that develop over time. It pulls in weather data, and correlates the device fleet’s performance metrics with environmental factors. The data dashboards Lumo has built are not the result of many months of work writing data integration routines and front-end coding, but are a result of vibe analysis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-under-the-hood"&gt;Getting under the hood&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sceptics of AI’s abilities often point to vibe-coding as an example of where things can go wrong, raising concerns about quality control and the “black box” nature of AI-driven analysis. Many users want visibility into how results are generated, with the option to inspect logic, tweak queries, or adjust API calls to ensure accuracy. When done well, vibe analytics addresses these concerns by combining transparency with rigour.

But to extract insights, there’s usually a good deal of manual work that needs to be done on raw data, either by semitechnical users (such as founders and product leaders), or dedicated – and expensive – data specialists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, to produce real value, information has to be collected, shepherded, altered, and drawn from dozens of spreadsheets and different business platforms: the organisation’s CRM, its martech stack, e-commerce system, and website data, to name a few common examples. Clearly, that’s a time consuming process, and the outcomes can be old news, rather than up-to-the-minute insights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-introducing-vibe-analytics"&gt;Introducing vibe analytics&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideal business solution would be querying real-time data using natural language (vs writing code in SQL or Python), with smart systems working in the background to correlate and parse different data sources and formats. This is vibe analysis, where users can simply ask questions in plain language and let AI do the heavy lifting. Instead of manual data-wrestling and business users spending hours uncovering insights hidden deep in datasets, they get results fast — in text, graphics, summaries, and, where needed, detailed breakdowns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast and accurate data analysis is important to every organisation, but for many, real-time insights are crucial. In the agricultural sector, for example, Lumo uses Fabi.ai’s platform to manage large fleets of IoT devices, collecting telemetry data continuously and adjusting its systems based on collated, normalised, and parsed information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using vibe analysis, Lumo sees device performance immediately, as well as trends that develop over time. It pulls in weather data, and correlates the device fleet’s performance metrics with environmental factors. The data dashboards Lumo has built are not the result of many months of work writing data integration routines and front-end coding, but are a result of vibe analysis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-under-the-hood"&gt;Getting under the hood&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sceptics of AI’s abilities often point to vibe-coding as an example of where things can go wrong, raising concerns about quality control and the “black box” nature of AI-driven analysis. Many users want visibility into how results are generated, with the option to inspect logic, tweak queries, or adjust API calls to ensure accuracy. When done well, vibe analytics addresses these concerns by combining transparency with rigour. Natural language inputs and modular build methods make it accessible to semitechnical users (such as founders and product leaders), while the underlying systems meet the accuracy and reliability standards expected by technical teams. This means users can trust the output whether they’re working independently or in collaboration with data scientists and developers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed specifically for both data experts and semitechnical data users, Fabi is a generative BI platform that brings vibe analysis done right to life.

Yet the launch also arrives amid unusual turbulence, as CEO Marc Benioff faces &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/11/slap-in-the-face-marc-benioffs-trump-turn-stuns-san-francisco-00604421"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fierce backlash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for recent comments &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/marc-benioff-san-francisco-guard.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;supporting President Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and suggesting National Guard troops should patrol San Francisco streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why 95% of enterprise AI projects never launch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are enormous. While companies have rushed to experiment with AI following ChatGPT&amp;#x27;s emergence two years ago, most enterprise deployments have stalled before reaching production, according to &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent MIT research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Salesforce executives cited extensively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Customers have invested a lot in AI, but they&amp;#x27;re not getting the value,&amp;quot; said Srini Tallapragada, Salesforce&amp;#x27;s president and chief engineering and customer success officer. &amp;quot;95% of enterprise AI pilots fail before production. It&amp;#x27;s not because of lack of intent. People want to do this. Everybody understands the power of the technology. But why is it so hard?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, according to Tallapragada, is that AI tools remain disconnected from enterprise workflows, data, and governance systems. &amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re writing prompts, prompts, you&amp;#x27;re getting frustrated because the context is not there,&amp;quot; he said, describing what he called a &amp;quot;prompt doom loop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s solution is a deeply integrated platform connecting what it calls four ingredients: the Agentforce 360 agent platform, Data 360 for unified data access, Customer 360 apps containing business logic, and Slack as the &amp;quot;conversational interface&amp;quot; where humans and agents collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Slack becomes the front door to Salesforce&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant strategic shift is the elevation of &lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Slack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — acquired by Salesforce in 2019 for &lt;a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-slack"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$27.7 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — as the primary interface for Salesforce itself. The company is effectively reimagining its traditional Lightning interface around Slack channels, where sales deals, service cases, and data insights will surface conversationally rather than through forms and dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Imagine that you maybe don&amp;#x27;t log into Salesforce, you don&amp;#x27;t see Salesforce, but it&amp;#x27;s there. It&amp;#x27;s coming to you in Slack, because that&amp;#x27;s where you&amp;#x27;re getting your work done,&amp;quot; Harris explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy includes embedding Salesforce&amp;#x27;s Agentforce agents for sales, IT service, HR service, and analytics directly into Slack, alongside a completely rebuilt Slackbot that acts as a personal AI companion. The company is also launching &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/channel-expert"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Channel Expert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; an always-on agent that provides instant answers from channel conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable third-party AI tools to access Slack&amp;#x27;s conversational data, Salesforce is releasing a &lt;a href="https://slack.dev/secure-data-connectivity-for-the-modern-ai-era/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Real-Time Search API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://slack.dev/secure-data-connectivity-for-the-modern-ai-era/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Model Context Protocol server&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Partners including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity, Writer, Dropbox, Notion, and Cursor are building agents that will live natively in Slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The best way to see the power of the platform is through the AI apps and agents already being built,&amp;quot; Rob Seaman, a Salesforce executive, said during a technical briefing, citing examples of startups &amp;quot;achieving tens of thousands of customers that have it installed in 120 days or less.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Voice and IT service take aim at new markets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Slack integration, Salesforce announced major expansions into voice-based interactions and employee service. &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/agentforce-voice-solutions-launch/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agentforce Voice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, now generally available, transforms traditional IVR systems into natural conversations that can update CRM records, trigger workflows, and seamlessly hand off to human agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IT Service offering represents Salesforce&amp;#x27;s most direct challenge to &lt;a href="https://www.servicenow.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ServiceNow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the market leader. Mudhu Sudhakar, who joined Salesforce two months ago as senior vice president for IT and HR Service, positioned the product as a fundamental reimagining of employee support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Legacy IT service management is very portals, forms, tickets focused, manual process,&amp;quot; Sudhakar said. &amp;quot;What we had a few key tenets: conversation first and agent first, really focused on having a conversational experience for the people requesting the support and for the people providing the support.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IT Service platform includes what Salesforce describes as 25+ specialized agents and 100+ pre-built workflows and connectors that can handle everything from password resets to complex incident management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early customers report dramatic efficiency gains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer results suggest the approach is gaining traction. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reddit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reduced average support resolution time from 8.9 minutes to 1.4 minutes — an 84% improvement — while deflecting 46% of cases entirely to AI agents. &amp;quot;This efficiency has allowed us to provide on-demand help for complex tasks and boost advertiser satisfaction scores by 20%,&amp;quot; said John Thompson, Reddit&amp;#x27;s VP of sales strategy and operations, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://engine.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Engine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a travel management company, reduced average handle time by 15%, saving over $2 million annually. &lt;a href="https://www.opentable.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenTable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; resolved 70% of restaurant and diner inquiries autonomously. And 1-800Accountant achieved a 90% case deflection rate during the critical tax week period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s own internal deployments may be most telling. Tallapragada&amp;#x27;s customer success organization now handles 1.8 million AI-powered conversations weekly, with metrics published at &lt;a href="http://help.salesforce.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;help.salesforce.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showing how many agents answer versus escalating to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more significantly, Salesforce has deployed AI-powered sales development representatives to follow up on leads that would previously have gone uncontacted due to cost constraints. &amp;quot;Now, Agentforce has an SDR which is doing thousands of leads following up,&amp;quot; Tallapragada explained. The company also increased proactive customer outreach by 40% by shifting staff from reactive support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The trust layer problem enterprises can&amp;#x27;t ignore&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given enterprise concerns about AI reliability, Salesforce has invested heavily in what it calls the &amp;quot;trust layer&amp;quot; — audit trails, compliance checks, and observability tools that let organizations monitor agent behavior at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You should think of an agent as a human. Digital labor. You need to manage performance just like a human. And you need these audit trails,&amp;quot; Tallapragada explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company encountered this challenge firsthand when its own agent deployment scaled. &amp;quot;When we started at Agentforce at Salesforce, we would track every message, which is great until 1,000, 3,000,&amp;quot; Tallapragada said. &amp;quot;Once you have a million chats, there&amp;#x27;s no human, we cannot do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform now includes &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/crm/salesforce-teases-a-new-agentforce-builder-announces-more-additions-to-the-platform/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agentforce Grid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; for searching across millions of conversations to identify and fix problematic patterns. The company also introduced Agent Script, a new scripting language that allows developers to define precise guardrails and deterministic controls for agent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Data infrastructure gets a major upgrade&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlying the agent capabilities is significant infrastructure investment. Salesforce&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-exactly-is-salesforce-customer-360/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data 360&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; includes &amp;quot;Intelligent Context,&amp;quot; which automatically extracts structured information from unstructured content like PDFs, diagrams, and flowcharts using what the company describes as &amp;quot;AI-powered unstructured data pipelines.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also collaborating with &lt;a href="https://www.databricks.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Databricks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.getdbt.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dbt Labs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Snowflake&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the &amp;quot;Universal Semantic Interchange,&amp;quot; an attempt to standardize how different platforms define business metrics. The pending $8 billion acquisition of Informatica, expected to close soon, will expand metadata management capabilities across the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The competitive landscape keeps intensifying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s aggressive AI agent push comes as virtually every major enterprise software vendor pursues similar strategies. Microsoft has embedded Copilot across its product line, Google offers agent capabilities through Vertex AI and Gemini, and ServiceNow has launched its own agentic offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how Salesforce&amp;#x27;s announcement compared to &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-dev-day-2025-chatgpt-becomes-the-new-app-store-and-hardware-is-coming"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&amp;#x27;s recent releases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tallapragada emphasized that customers will use multiple AI tools simultaneously. &amp;quot;Most of the time I&amp;#x27;m seeing they&amp;#x27;re using OpenAI, they&amp;#x27;re using Gemini, they&amp;#x27;re using Anthropic, just like Salesforce, we use all three,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real differentiation, executives argued, lies not in the AI models but in the integration with business processes and data. Harris framed the competition in terms familiar from Salesforce&amp;#x27;s founding: &amp;quot;26 years ago, we just said, let&amp;#x27;s make Salesforce automation as easy as buying a book on Amazon.com. We&amp;#x27;re doing that same thing. We want to make agentic AI as easy as buying a book on Amazon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s customer success stories are impressive but remain a small fraction of its customer base. With 150,000 Salesforce customers and one million Slack customers, the 12,000 Agentforce deployments represent roughly 8% penetration — strong for a one-year-old product line, but hardly ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s stock, down &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-stock-trades-near-52-132500685.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;roughly 28% year to date&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-crm-ai-dreamforce/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Relative Strength rating of just 15&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests investors remain skeptical. This week&amp;#x27;s Dreamforce demonstrations — and the months of customer deployments that follow — will begin to provide answers to whether Salesforce can finally move enterprise AI from pilots to production at scale, or whether the &amp;quot;$7 billion business&amp;quot; remains more aspiration than reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

It&amp;#x27;s not because of lack of intent. People want to do this. Everybody understands the power of the technology. But why is it so hard?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, according to Tallapragada, is that AI tools remain disconnected from enterprise workflows, data, and governance systems. &amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re writing prompts, prompts, you&amp;#x27;re getting frustrated because the context is not there,&amp;quot; he said, describing what he called a &amp;quot;prompt doom loop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s solution is a deeply integrated platform connecting what it calls four ingredients: the Agentforce 360 agent platform, Data 360 for unified data access, Customer 360 apps containing business logic, and Slack as the &amp;quot;conversational interface&amp;quot; where humans and agents collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Slack becomes the front door to Salesforce&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant strategic shift is the elevation of &lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Slack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — acquired by Salesforce in 2019 for &lt;a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-slack"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$27.7 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — as the primary interface for Salesforce itself. The company is effectively reimagining its traditional Lightning interface around Slack channels, where sales deals, service cases, and data insights will surface conversationally rather than through forms and dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Imagine that you maybe don&amp;#x27;t log into Salesforce, you don&amp;#x27;t see Salesforce, but it&amp;#x27;s there. It&amp;#x27;s coming to you in Slack, because that&amp;#x27;s where you&amp;#x27;re getting your work done,&amp;quot; Harris explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy includes embedding Salesforce&amp;#x27;s Agentforce agents for sales, IT service, HR service, and analytics directly into Slack, alongside a completely rebuilt Slackbot that acts as a personal AI companion. The company is also launching &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/channel-expert"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Channel Expert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; an always-on agent that provides instant answers from channel conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable third-party AI tools to access Slack&amp;#x27;s conversational data, Salesforce is releasing a &lt;a href="https://slack.dev/secure-data-connectivity-for-the-modern-ai-era/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Real-Time Search API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://slack.dev/secure-data-connectivity-for-the-modern-ai-era/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Model Context Protocol server&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Partners including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity, Writer, Dropbox, Notion, and Cursor are building agents that will live natively in Slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The best way to see the power of the platform is through the AI apps and agents already being built,&amp;quot; Rob Seaman, a Salesforce executive, said during a technical briefing, citing examples of startups &amp;quot;achieving tens of thousands of customers that have it installed in 120 days or less.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Voice and IT service take aim at new markets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Slack integration, Salesforce announced major expansions into voice-based interactions and employee service. &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/agentforce-voice-solutions-launch/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agentforce Voice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, now generally available, transforms traditional IVR systems into natural conversations that can update CRM records, trigger workflows, and seamlessly hand off to human agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IT Service offering represents Salesforce&amp;#x27;s most direct challenge to &lt;a href="https://www.servicenow.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ServiceNow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the market leader. Mudhu Sudhakar, who joined Salesforce two months ago as senior vice president for IT and HR Service, positioned the product as a fundamental reimagining of employee support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Legacy IT service management is very portals, forms, tickets focused, manual process,&amp;quot; Sudhakar said. &amp;quot;What we had a few key tenets: conversation first and agent first, really focused on having a conversational experience for the people requesting the support and for the people providing the support.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IT Service platform includes what Salesforce describes as 25+ specialized agents and 100+ pre-built workflows and connectors that can handle everything from password resets to complex incident management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early customers report dramatic efficiency gains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer results suggest the approach is gaining traction. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reddit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reduced average support resolution time from 8.9 minutes to 1.4 minutes — an 84% improvement — while deflecting 46% of cases entirely to AI agents. &amp;quot;This efficiency has allowed us to provide on-demand help for complex tasks and boost advertiser satisfaction scores by 20%,&amp;quot; said John Thompson, Reddit&amp;#x27;s VP of sales strategy and operations, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://engine.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Engine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a travel management company, reduced average handle time by 15%, saving over $2 million annually. &lt;a href="https://www.opentable.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenTable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; resolved 70% of restaurant and diner inquiries autonomously. And 1-800Accountant achieved a 90% case deflection rate during the critical tax week period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s own internal deployments may be most telling. Tallapragada&amp;#x27;s customer success organization now handles 1.8 million AI-powered conversations weekly, with metrics published at &lt;a href="http://help.salesforce.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;help.salesforce.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showing how many agents answer versus escalating to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more significantly, Salesforce has deployed AI-powered sales development representatives to follow up on leads that would previously have gone uncontacted due to cost constraints. &amp;quot;Now, Agentforce has an SDR which is doing thousands of leads following up,&amp;quot; Tallapragada explained. The company also increased proactive customer outreach by 40% by shifting staff from reactive support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The trust layer problem enterprises can&amp;#x27;t ignore&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given enterprise concerns about AI reliability, Salesforce has invested heavily in what it calls the &amp;quot;trust layer&amp;quot; — audit trails, compliance checks, and observability tools that let organizations monitor agent behavior at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You should think of an agent as a human. Digital labor. You need to manage performance just like a human. And you need these audit trails,&amp;quot; Tallapragada explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company encountered this challenge firsthand when its own agent deployment scaled. &amp;quot;When we started at Agentforce at Salesforce, we would track every message, which is great until 1,000, 3,000,&amp;quot; Tallapragada said. &amp;quot;Once you have a million chats, there&amp;#x27;s no human, we cannot do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform now includes &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/crm/salesforce-teases-a-new-agentforce-builder-announces-more-additions-to-the-platform/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agentforce Grid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; for searching across millions of conversations to identify and fix problematic patterns. The company also introduced Agent Script, a new scripting language that allows developers to define precise guardrails and deterministic controls for agent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Data infrastructure gets a major upgrade&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlying the agent capabilities is significant infrastructure investment. Salesforce&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-exactly-is-salesforce-customer-360/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data 360&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; includes &amp;quot;Intelligent Context,&amp;quot; which automatically extracts structured information from unstructured content like PDFs, diagrams, and flowcharts using what the company describes as &amp;quot;AI-powered unstructured data pipelines.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also collaborating with &lt;a href="https://www.databricks.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Databricks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.getdbt.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dbt Labs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Snowflake&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the &amp;quot;Universal Semantic Interchange,&amp;quot; an attempt to standardize how different platforms define business metrics. The pending $8 billion acquisition of Informatica, expected to close soon, will expand metadata management capabilities across the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The competitive landscape keeps intensifying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#x27;s aggressive AI agent push comes as virtually every major enterprise software vendor pursues similar strategies. Microsoft has embedded Copilot across its product line, Google offers agent capabilities through Vertex AI and Gemini, and ServiceNow has launched its own agentic offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how Salesforce&amp;#x27;s announcement compared to &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-dev-day-2025-chatgpt-becomes-the-new-app-store-and-hardware-is-coming"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&amp;#x27;s recent releases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tallapragada emphasized that customers will use multiple AI tools simultaneously. &amp;quot;Most of the time I&amp;#x27;m seeing they&amp;#x27;re using OpenAI, they&amp;#x27;re using Gemini, they&amp;#x27;re using Anthropic, just like Salesforce, we use all three,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real differentiation, executives argued, lies not in the AI models but in the integration with business processes and data. Harris framed the competition in terms familiar from Salesforce&amp;#x27;s founding: &amp;quot;26 years ago, we just said, let&amp;#x27;s make Salesforce automation as easy as buying a book on Amazon.com. We&amp;#x27;re doing that same thing. We want to make agentic AI as easy as buying a book on Amazon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s customer success stories are impressive but remain a small fraction of its customer base. With 150,000 Salesforce customers and one million Slack customers, the 12,000 Agentforce deployments represent roughly 8% penetration — strong for a one-year-old product line, but hardly ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s stock, down &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-stock-trades-near-52-132500685.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;roughly 28% year to date&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-crm-ai-dreamforce/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Relative Strength rating of just 15&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests investors remain skeptical. This week&amp;#x27;s Dreamforce demonstrations — and the months of customer deployments that follow — will begin to provide answers to whether Salesforce can finally move enterprise AI from pilots to production at scale, or whether the &amp;quot;$7 billion business&amp;quot; remains more aspiration than reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
