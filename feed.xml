&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partnership will see Pine Labs embed OpenAI’s application programming interfaces — software tools that let companies plug AI into their existing systems — within its payments and commerce infrastructure, the companies said on Thursday, all with the aim of enabling AI-assisted settlement, reconciliation, and invoicing workflows.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal underscores OpenAI’s broader push to expand its footprint in India, one of its fastest-growing markets, as it looks to move beyond being known primarily as the maker of ChatGPT and embed its technology into education, enterprise, and infrastructure. Earlier this week, OpenAI partnered with leading Indian engineering, medical, and design institutions to bring AI tools into higher education, betting that India’s large developer base and more than a billion internet users will play a central role in the next phase of AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pine Labs is already using AI internally to automate parts of its settlement and reconciliation process, cutting the time it takes to clear daily settlements from hours to minutes, according to Chief executive B Amrish Rau. The Noida-based company previously relied on manual checks by dozens of employees to process funds from multiple banks before markets opened each day, a workflow that is now largely handled by AI-driven systems, he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Pine Labs, the partnership is intended to extend those AI-driven efficiencies beyond internal operations to merchants and corporate clients, starting with business-to-business use cases such as invoice processing, settlements and payments orchestration, Rau told TechCrunch. He noted the company sees faster adoption in B2B workflows, where AI agents can handle large volumes of repetitive financial tasks under predefined rules, before similar capabilities reach consumer-facing payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“People talk about retail AI, but the bigger impact of all of this is really efficiency improvement, especially in B2B,” Rau said. “If you look at invoicing and settlement, those are workflows where agents can actually drive the process end to end, and that’s where adoption can happen faster.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The rollout of more autonomous, agent-led payment workflows will move faster in overseas markets where regulations already allow such transactions, Rau said, while India is likely to see a more gradual adoption focused on AI-assisted commerce rather than fully agent-initiated payments. He said that Pine Labs is already prototyping agent-driven payments in parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, even as Indian regulations require tighter controls on how payments are authorized.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For OpenAI, the partnership offers a route deeper into India’s payments and enterprise ecosystem as it looks to move beyond consumer-facing tools and embed its models into high-volume, regulated workflows. Rau said the collaboration is aimed at increasing merchant stickiness and expanding Pine Labs’ role from a payments processor to a broader commerce platform, with higher transaction volumes over time translating into incremental revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pine Labs says it works with more than 980,000 merchants, 716 consumer brands, and 177 financial institutions, and has processed over 6 billion cumulative transactions valued at over ₹11.4 trillion (about $126 billion), per its prospectus published last year. The fintech operates across 20 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, parts of Africa, the UAE, and the U.S., giving the OpenAI partnership reach across both Indian and international markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rau said the partnership does not involve revenue sharing between the two companies, with Pine Labs not taking a cut if its merchants choose to embed OpenAI’s tools. “We’ve kept it completely independent of each other — anything related to payment and payment services, we will get the benefit of it, and anything related to OpenAI revenues will go to them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The arrangement, Rau added, is also non-exclusive. He compared it to OpenAI’s partnership with Stripe in the U.S. and said Pine Labs remains open to working with other AI providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rau said Pine Labs is building additional security and compliance layers around AI-driven workflows to ensure that sensitive merchant and consumer transaction data remains protected, as the company integrates AI more deeply into its payments systems. He said the focus is on ensuring transactions remain secure and compliant even as more workflows are automated by AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pine Labs’ interest in AI-driven commerce builds on earlier work through its Setu unit, which has experimented with agent-led bill payment experiences using chatbots including ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. Separately, India also began piloting consumer payments directly through AI chatbots last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new announcement comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where global AI companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are showcasing their latest capabilities alongside Indian startups demonstrating AI applications aimed at large-scale deployment across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2170386424.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As India pitches itself as a global hub for applied artificial intelligence, OpenAI has partnered with Pine Labs to integrate AI-driven reasoning into the fintech firm’s payments stack, automating settlement and invoicing workflows in a move the companies say could help accelerate AI-led commerce in India.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It happens every day — a motorist heading across town checks a navigation app to see how long the trip will take, but they find no parking spots available when they reach their destination. By the time they finally park and walk to their destination, they’re significantly later than they expected to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most popular navigation systems send drivers to a location without considering the extra time that could be needed to find parking. This causes more than just a headache for drivers. It can worsen congestion and increase emissions by causing motorists to cruise around looking for a parking spot. This underestimation could also discourage people from taking mass transit because they don’t realize it might be faster than driving and parking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers tackled this problem by developing a system that can be used to identify parking lots that offer the best balance of proximity to the desired location and likelihood of parking availability. Their adaptable method points users to the ideal parking area rather than their destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simulated tests with real-world traffic data from Seattle, this technique achieved time savings of up to 66 percent in the most congested settings. For a motorist, this would reduce travel time by about 35 minutes, compared to waiting for a spot to open in the closest parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they haven’t designed a system ready for the real world yet, their demonstrations show the viability of this approach and indicate how it could be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This frustration is real and felt by a lot of people, and the bigger issue here is that systematically underestimating these drive times prevents people from making informed choices. It makes it that much harder for people to make shifts to public transit, bikes, or alternative forms of transportation,” says MIT graduate student Cameron Hickert, lead author on a paper describing the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hickert is joined on the paper by Sirui Li PhD ’25; Zhengbing He, a research scientist in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS); and senior author Cathy Wu, the Class of 1954 Career Development Associate Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) at MIT, and a member of LIDS. The research appears today in &lt;em&gt;Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probable parking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve the parking problem, the researchers developed a probability-aware approach that considers all possible public parking lots near a destination, the distance to drive there from a point of origin, the distance to walk from each lot to the destination, and the likelihood of parking success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach, based on dynamic programming, works backward from good outcomes to calculate the best route for the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their method also considers the case where a user arrives at the ideal parking lot but can’t find a space. It takes into the account the distance to other parking lots and the probability of success of parking at each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there are several lots nearby that have slightly lower probabilities of success, but are very close to each other, it might be a smarter play to drive there rather than going to the higher-probability lot and hoping to find an opening. Our framework can account for that,” Hickert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, their system can identify the optimal lot that has the lowest expected time required to drive, park, and walk to the destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no motorist expects to be the only one trying to park in a busy city center. So, this method also incorporates the actions of other drivers, which affect the user’s probability of parking success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, another driver may arrive at the user’s ideal lot first and take the last parking spot. Or another motorist could try parking in another lot but then park in the user’s ideal lot if unsuccessful. In addition, another motorist may park in a different lot and cause spillover effects that lower the user’s chances of success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With our framework, we show how you can model all those scenarios in a very clean and principled manner,” Hickert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowdsourced parking data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data on parking availability could come from several sources. For example, some parking lots have magnetic detectors or gates that track the number of cars entering and exiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But such sensors aren’t widely used, so to make their system more feasible for real-world deployment, the researchers studied the effectiveness of using crowdsourced data instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, users could indicate available parking using an app. Data could also be gathered by tracking the number of vehicles circling to find parking, or how many enter a lot and exit after being unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someday, autonomous vehicles could even report on open parking spots they drive by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right now, a lot of that information goes nowhere. But if we could capture it, even by having someone simply tap ‘no parking’ in an app, that could be an important source of information that allows people to make more informed decisions,” Hickert adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers evaluated their system using real-world traffic data from the Seattle area, simulating different times of day in a congested urban setting and a suburban area. In congested settings, their approach cut total travel time by about 60 percent compared to sitting and waiting for a spot to open, and by about 20 percent compared to a strategy of continually driving to the next closet parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that crowdsourced observations of parking availability would have an error rate of only about 7 percent, compared to actual parking availability. This indicates it could be an effective way to gather parking probability data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to conduct larger studies using real-time route information in an entire city. They also want to explore additional avenues for gathering data on parking availability, such as using satellite images, and estimate potential emissions reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Transportation systems are so large and complex that they are really hard to change. What we look for, and what we found with this approach, is small changes that can have a big impact to help people make better choices, reduce congestion, and reduce emissions,” says Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by Cintra, the MIT Energy Initiative, and the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

The move is part of a broader push to deepen the company’s enterprise and infrastructure footprint in one of its fastest-growing markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced on Thursday that the partnership with the Tata Group is part of its Stargate project, which aims to build AI-ready infrastructure and expand enterprise adoption globally. OpenAI will become the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services’ HyperVault data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of capacity. The deal also includes deploying ChatGPT Enterprise across Tata’s workforce and standardizing AI-native software development through OpenAI’s tools.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partnership, which falls under the “OpenAI for India” initiative, highlights the company’s expanding footprint in the country, which according to recent estimates from CEO Sam Altman has more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users spanning students, teachers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The scale of adoption has positioned India as one of OpenAI’s most important growth markets as it deepens enterprise and infrastructure investments in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The local data center capacity will allow OpenAI to run its most advanced models within India, reducing latency for users while meeting data residency, security, and compliance requirements for regulated sectors and government workloads. Hosting compute domestically is critical for enterprises that handle sensitive data and operate under data localization and digital infrastructure rules. These circumstances could widen OpenAI’s access to enterprise customers that require in-country processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An initial 100 megawatts of capacity represents a substantial commitment in the context of AI infrastructure, where large-scale model training and inference require power-hungry clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally, underlining the scale of OpenAI’s long-term ambitions in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond infrastructure, OpenAI and Tata Group will pursue a strategic enterprise collaboration aimed at accelerating AI adoption across Tata’s businesses. The conglomerate plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce over the coming years, beginning with hundreds of thousands of employees at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally. TCS also intends to use OpenAI’s Codex tools to standardize AI-native software development across its engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, said OpenAI’s partnership would help build “state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India” while supporting efforts to skill the country’s workforce for the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, including whether OpenAI is making a capital investment in HyperVault or leasing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In November 2025, TCS secured backing from private equity firm TPG to develop AI-ready infrastructure in India under its HyperVault data center business. The platform is backed by about ₹180 billion (about $2 billion) in planned investment and is designed to support large-scale compute workloads for hyperscalers and enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will also expand its certification programs in India, with TCS becoming the first participating organization outside the United States. The certifications are designed to help professionals build practical AI skills across roles and industries, the company said. The move follows OpenAI’s recent partnerships with leading Indian institutions in engineering, medicine, and design.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to open new offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its existing presence in New Delhi as it deepens operations in the country. The expansion is expected to support enterprise partnerships, developer engagement, and local regulatory coordination as the company scales its footprint in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where global AI leaders, including Sam Altman, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai are participating alongside Indian startups and enterprises showcasing AI applications across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has been expanding its presence in India through partnerships with companies including Pine Labs, JioHotstar, Eternal, Cars24, HCLTech, PhonePe, CRED, and MakeMyTrip, as it seeks to embed its models across consumer platforms, enterprise systems and digital payments infrastructure in one of the world’s largest internet markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Together, the data center build-out, enterprise deployments, and expanding partner ecosystem signal OpenAI’s most comprehensive push yet to anchor advanced AI infrastructure and applications in India.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/india-chatgpt.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI has partnered with India’s Tata Group to secure 100 megawatts of AI-ready data center capacity in the country, with plans to scale to 1 gigawatt. The move is part of a broader push to deepen the company’s enterprise and infrastructure footprint in one of its fastest-growing markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced on Thursday that the partnership with the Tata Group is part of its Stargate project, which aims to build AI-ready infrastructure and expand enterprise adoption globally. OpenAI will become the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services’ HyperVault data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of capacity. The deal also includes deploying ChatGPT Enterprise across Tata’s workforce and standardizing AI-native software development through OpenAI’s tools.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partnership, which falls under the “OpenAI for India” initiative, highlights the company’s expanding footprint in the country, which according to recent estimates from CEO Sam Altman has more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users spanning students, teachers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The scale of adoption has positioned India as one of OpenAI’s most important growth markets as it deepens enterprise and infrastructure investments in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The local data center capacity will allow OpenAI to run its most advanced models within India, reducing latency for users while meeting data residency, security, and compliance requirements for regulated sectors and government workloads. Hosting compute domestically is critical for enterprises that handle sensitive data and operate under data localization and digital infrastructure rules. These circumstances could widen OpenAI’s access to enterprise customers that require in-country processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An initial 100 megawatts of capacity represents a substantial commitment in the context of AI infrastructure, where large-scale model training and inference require power-hungry clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally, underlining the scale of OpenAI’s long-term ambitions in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond infrastructure, OpenAI and Tata Group will pursue a strategic enterprise collaboration aimed at accelerating AI adoption across Tata’s businesses.

A new pilot by DBS Bank shows how that change may soon affect everyday payments, as financial institutions begin testing systems that allow AI agents to complete purchases on behalf of customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DBS is working with Visa to trial Visa Intelligent Commerce, a framework designed to support transactions initiated by AI software not humans. The system allows digital agents to search for products, select options, and complete purchases using payment credentials issued and controlled by the bank. According to reports from &lt;em&gt;Asian Banking &amp;amp; Finance&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fintech Futures&lt;/em&gt;, the pilot has already processed real transactions, including food and beverage purchases made using DBS or POSB cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Moving from recommendations to real transactions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial highlights how banks are preparing for what some in the industry call “agent-driven commerce.” In this model, AI tools act subject to rules set by both the customer and the issuing bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa’s approach keeps the bank at the centre of the process. Payment details are tokenised, and transactions pass through issuer-controlled approval flows designed to confirm identity and spending limits. The means the bank still decides whether the agent’s action fits the user’s permissions before money moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DBS pilot is part of a wider effort to test where AI fits into financial infrastructure. Rather than treating AI as a customer-facing tool, banks are increasingly examining how it might change the mechanics of payments, fraud checks, and authorisation. Industry observers note that this is a change from AI as a productivity assistant to AI as an operational participant in transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early use cases focus on routine purchases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early use cases for agent-based commerce include routine purchases like ordering groceries, renewing subscriptions, booking travel, or restocking household items. In these cases, the agent follows instructions set in advance by the user, like budget limits or preferred brands. DBS and Visa plan to expand the pilot into broader online shopping and travel bookings as testing continues, according to &lt;em&gt;Fintech Futures&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of AI executing purchases raises opportunity and risk for financial institutions. On one hand, banks that support agent-based payments could gain a stronger role in digital commerce by acting as the control layer that manages consent and security. On the other, they must handle new questions about liability and dispute handling if an agent makes a purchase the customer later challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security and governance will likely shape how fast this model spreads. Analysts often point out that customers may accept AI suggestions long before they accept AI decisions involving money. By keeping approval logic in the issuing bank’s systems, Visa’s framework attempts to reassure users that human oversight remains embedded in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A wider change in how enterprises deploy AI agents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, many companies have moved beyond testing chatbots or internal assistants and started placing AI into workflows that directly affect revenue, operations, or customer transactions. In banking, this includes fraud monitoring, credit scoring support, and automated customer service. Allowing AI to trigger payments could be the next step in that progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DBS has invested heavily in digital banking systems, and the trial fits into a longer effort to integrate automation into financial services. The bank has focused previously on using data analytics and AI tools to streamline operations and personalise services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether agent-based payments become common will depend on how comfortable customers feel delegating financial decisions to software. It will also depend on how clearly banks define the boundaries of what AI agents can and cannot do. Industry experts say adoption may begin with low-risk, repeat purchases before expanding to more complex transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Patrick Tomasso)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: How financial institutions are embedding AI decision-making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

DBS and Visa plan to expand the pilot into broader online shopping and travel bookings as testing continues, according to &lt;em&gt;Fintech Futures&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of AI executing purchases raises opportunity and risk for financial institutions. On one hand, banks that support agent-based payments could gain a stronger role in digital commerce by acting as the control layer that manages consent and security. On the other, they must handle new questions about liability and dispute handling if an agent makes a purchase the customer later challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security and governance will likely shape how fast this model spreads. Analysts often point out that customers may accept AI suggestions long before they accept AI decisions involving money. By keeping approval logic in the issuing bank’s systems, Visa’s framework attempts to reassure users that human oversight remains embedded in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A wider change in how enterprises deploy AI agents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, many companies have moved beyond testing chatbots or internal assistants and started placing AI into workflows that directly affect revenue, operations, or customer transactions. In banking, this includes fraud monitoring, credit scoring support, and automated customer service. Allowing AI to trigger payments could be the next step in that progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DBS has invested heavily in digital banking systems, and the trial fits into a longer effort to integrate automation into financial services. The bank has focused previously on using data analytics and AI tools to streamline operations and personalise services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether agent-based payments become common will depend on how comfortable customers feel delegating financial decisions to software. It will also depend on how clearly banks define the boundaries of what AI agents can and cannot do. Industry experts say adoption may begin with low-risk, repeat purchases before expanding to more complex transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Patrick Tomasso)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: How financial institutions are embedding AI decision-making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Deep-pocketed corporations with top-tier legal teams easily exploited those difficulties.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Now those tides might be turning. More climate-related lawsuits are getting filed, particularly in the Global South. Governments, nonprofits, and citizens in the most climate-exposed nations continue to test new legal arguments in new courts, and some of those courts are showing a new willingness to put nations and their industries on the hook as a matter of human rights. In addition, the science of figuring out exactly who is to blame for specific weather disasters, and to what degree, is getting better and better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s true that no court has yet held any climate emitter liable for climate-related damages. For starters, nations are generally immune from lawsuits originating in other countries. That’s why most cases have focused on major carbon producers. But they’ve leaned on a pretty powerful defense.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;While oil and gas companies extract, refine, and sell the world’s fossil fuels, most of the emissions come out of “the vehicles, power plants, and factories that burn the fuel,” as Michael Gerrard and Jessica Wentz, of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center, note in a recent piece in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, companies just dig the stuff up. It’s not their fault someone else sets it on fire.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So victims of extreme weather events continue to try new legal avenues and approaches, backed by ever-more-convincing science. Plaintiffs in the Philippines recently sued the oil giant Shell over its role in driving Super Typhoon Odette, a 2021 storm that killed more than 400 people and displaced nearly 800,000.

It was, unmistakably, a “narco sub,” a stealthy fiberglass vessel that sails with its hull almost entirely underwater, used by drug cartels to move cocaine north. The plane’s crew radioed it in, and eventually nearby coast guard boats got the order, routine but urgent: Intercept.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Cartagena, about 150 miles from the action, Captain Jaime González Zamudio, commander of the regional coast guard group, sat down at his desk to watch what happened next. On his computer monitor, icons representing his patrol boats raced toward the sub’s coordinates as updates crackled over his radio from the crews at sea. This was all standard; Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, and its navy has been seizing narco subs for decades. And so the captain was pretty sure what the outcome would be. His crew would catch up to the sub, just a bit of it showing above the water’s surface. They’d bring it to heel, board it, and force open the hatch to find two, three, maybe four exhausted men suffocating in a mix of diesel fumes and humidity, and a cargo compartment holding several tons of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boats caught up to the sub. A crew boarded, forced open the hatch, and confirmed that the vessel was secure. But from that point on, things were different.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, some unexpected details came over the radio: There was no cocaine on board. Neither was there a crew, nor a helm, nor even enough room for a person to lie down. Instead, inside the hull the crew found a fuel tank, an autopilot system and control electronics, and a remotely monitored security camera. González Zamudio’s crew started sending pictures back to Cartagena: Bolted to the hull was another camera, as well as two plastic rectangles, each about the size of a cookie sheet—antennas for connecting to Starlink satellite internet.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The authorities towed the boat back to Cartagena, where military techs took a closer look. Weeks later, they came to an unsettling conclusion: This was Colombia’s first confirmed &lt;em&gt;uncrewed&lt;/em&gt; narco sub. It could be operated by remote control, but it was also capable of some degree of autonomous travel. The techs concluded that the sub was likely a prototype built by the Clan del Golfo, a powerful criminal group that operates along the Caribbean coast.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. Law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what the Tayrona sub means for the future—whether it was merely an isolated experiment or the opening move in a new era of autonomous drug smuggling at sea.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Drug traffickers love the ocean. “You can move drug traffic through legal and illegal routes,” says Juan Pablo Serrano, a captain in the Colombian navy and head of the operational coordination center for Orión, a multiagency, multinational counternarcotics effort. The giant container ships at the heart of global commerce offer a favorite approach, Serrano says. Bribe a chain of dockworkers and inspectors, hide a load in one of thousands of cargo boxes, and put it on a totally legal commercial vessel headed to Europe or North America. That route is slow and expensive—involving months of transit and bribes spread across a wide network—but relatively low risk. “A ship can carry 5,000 containers. Good luck finding the right one,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Far less legal, but much faster and cheaper, are small, powerful motorboats. Quick to build and cheap to crew, these “go-fasts” top out at just under 50 feet long and can move smaller loads in hours rather than days. But they’re also easy for coastal radars and patrols to spot.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Submersibles—or, more accurately, “semisubmersibles”—fit somewhere in the middle. They take more money and engineering to build than an open speedboat, but they buy stealth—even if a bit of the vessel rides at the surface, the bulk stays hidden underwater. That adds another option to a portfolio that smugglers constantly rebalance across three variables: risk, time, and cost. When US and Colombian authorities tightened control over air routes and commercial shipping in the early 1990s, subs became more attractive. The first ones were crude wooden hulls with a fiberglass shell and extra fuel tanks, cobbled together in mangrove estuaries, hidden from prying eyes. Today’s fiberglass semisubmersible designs ride mostly below the surface, relying on diesel engines that can push multi-ton loads for days at a time while presenting little more than a ripple and a hot exhaust pipe to radar and infrared sensors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A typical semisubmersible costs under $2 million to build and can carry three metric tons of cocaine. That’s worth over $160 million in Europe—wholesale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most ferry between South American coasts and handoff points in Central America and Mexico, where allied criminal organizations break up the cargo and slowly funnel it toward the US. But some now go much farther. In 2019, Spanish authorities intercepted a semisubmersible after a 27-day transatlantic voyage from Brazil. In 2024, police in the Solomon Islands found the first narco sub in the Asia-Pacific region, a semisubmersible probably originating from Colombia on its way to Australia or New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the variables are risk, time, and cost, then the economics of a narco sub are simple. Even if they spend more time on the water than a powerboat, they’re less likely to get caught—and a relative bargain to produce. A narco sub might cost between $1&amp;nbsp;million and $2 million to build, but a kilo of cocaine costs just about $500 to make. “By the time that kilo reaches Europe, it can sell for between $44,000 and $55,000,” Serrano says. A typical semisubmersible carries up to three metric tons—cargo worth well over $160 million at European wholesale prices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;Off-the-shelf nautical autopilots, WiFi antennas, Starlink satellite internet connections, and remote cameras are all drug smugglers need to turn semisubmersibles into drone ships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, narco subs are getting more common. Seizures by authorities tripled in the last 20 years, according to Colombia’s International Center for Research and Analysis Against Maritime Drug Trafficking (CMCON), and Serrano admits that the Orión alliance has enough ships and aircraft to catch only a fraction of what sails.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until now, though, narco subs have had one major flaw: They depended on people, usually poor fishermen or low-level recruits sealed into stifling compartments for days at a time, steering by GPS and sight, hoping not to be spotted. That made the subs expensive and a risk to drug sellers if captured. Like good capitalists, the Tayrona boat’s builders seem to have been trying to obviate labor costs with automation. No crew means more room for drugs or fuel and no sailors to pay—or to get arrested or flip if a mission goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have a person or people on board, that makes the transoceanic routes much more feasible,” says Henry Shuldiner, a researcher at InSight Crime who has analyzed hundreds of narco-sub cases. It’s one thing, he notes, to persuade someone to spend a day or two going from Colombia to Panama for a big payout; it’s another to ask four people to spend three weeks sealed inside a cramped tube, sleeping, eating, and relieving themselves in the same space. “That’s a hard sell,” Shuldiner says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An uncrewed sub doesn’t have to race to a rendezvous because its crew can endure only a few days inside. It can move more slowly and stealthily. It can wait out patrols or bad weather, loiter near a meeting point, or take longer and less well-monitored routes. And if something goes wrong—if a military plane appears or navigation fails—its owners can simply scuttle the vessel from afar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the basic technology to make all that work is getting more and more affordable, and the potential profit margins are rising. “The rapidly approaching universality of autonomous technology could be a nightmare for the U.S. Coast Guard,” wrote two Coast Guard officers in the US Naval Institute’s journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; in 2021. And as if to prove how good an idea drone narco subs are, the US Marine Corps and the weapons builder Leidos are testing a low-profile uncrewed vessel called the Sea Specter, which they describe as being “inspired” by narco-sub design.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The possibility that drug smugglers are experimenting with autonomous subs isn’t just theoretical. Law enforcement agencies on other smuggling routes have found signs the Tayrona sub isn’t an isolated case. In 2022, Spanish police seized three small submersible drones near Cádiz, on Spain’s southern coast. Two years later, Italian authorities confiscated a remote-­controlled minisubmarine they believed was intended for drug runs. “The probability of expansion is high,” says Diego Cánovas, a port and maritime security expert in Spain. Tayrona, the biggest and most technologically advanced uncrewed narco sub found so far, is more likely a preview than an anomaly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the Tayrona semisubmersible sits on a strip of grass at the ARC Bolívar naval base in Cartagena. It’s exposed to the elements; rain has streaked its paint. To one side lies an older, bulkier narco sub seized a decade ago, a blue cylinder with a clumsy profile. The Tayrona’s hull looks lower, leaner, and more refined.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Up close, it is also unmistakably handmade. The hull is a dull gray-blue, the fiberglass rough in places, with scrapes and dents from the tow that brought it into port. It has no identifying marks on the exterior—nothing that would tie it to a country, a company, or a port. On the upper surface sit the two Starlink antennas, painted over in the same gray-blue to keep them from standing out against the sea.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I climb up a ladder and drop through the small hatch near the stern. Inside, the air is damp and close, the walls beaded with condensation. Small puddles of fuel have collected in the bilge. The vessel has no seating, no helm or steering wheel, and not enough space to stand up straight or lie down. It’s clear it was never meant to carry people. A technical report by CMCON found that the sub would have enough fuel for a journey of some 800 nautical miles, and the central cargo bay would hold between 1 and 1.5 tons of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the aft end, the machinery compartment is a tangle of hardware: diesel engine, batteries, pumps, and a chaotic bundle of cables feeding an electronics rack. All the core components are still there. Inside that rack, investigators identified a NAC-3 autopilot processor, a commercial unit designed to steer midsize boats by tying into standard hydraulic pumps, heading sensors, and rudder-­feedback systems. They cost about $2,200 on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“These are plug-and-play technologies,” says Wilmar Martínez, a mechatronics professor at the University of America in Bogotá, when I show him pictures of the inside of the sub. “Midcareer mechatronics students could install them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For all its advantages, an autonomous drug-smuggling submarine wouldn’t be invincible. Even without a crew on board, there are still people in the chain. Every satellite internet terminal—Starlink or not—comes with a billing address, a payment method, and a log of where and when it pings the constellation. Colombian officers have begun to talk about negotiating formal agreements with providers, asking them to alert authorities when a transceiver’s movements match known smuggling patterns. Brazil’s government has already cut a deal with Starlink to curb criminal use of its service in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The basic playbook for finding a drone sub will look much like the one for crewed semisubmersibles. Aircraft and ships will use radar to pick out small anomalies and infrared cameras to look for the heat of a diesel engine or the turbulence of a wake. That said, it might not work. “If they wind up being smaller, they’re going to be darn near impossible to detect,” says Michael Knickerbocker, a former US Navy officer who advises defense tech firms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous drug subs are “a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities,” says one researcher.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even worse, navies already act on only a fraction of their intelligence leads because they don’t have enough ships and aircraft. The answer, Knickerbocker argues, is “robot on robot.” Navies and coast guards will need swarms of their own small, relatively cheap uncrewed systems—surface vessels, underwater gliders, and long-endurance aerial vehicles that can loiter, sense, and relay data back to human operators. Those experiments have already begun. The US 4th Fleet, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean, is experimenting with uncrewed platforms in counternarcotics patrols. Across the Atlantic, the European Union’s European Maritime Safety Agency operates drones for maritime surveillance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, though, the major screens against oceangoing vessels of all kinds are coastal radar networks. Spain operates SIVE to watch over choke points like the Strait of Gibraltar, and in the Pacific, Australia’s over-the-horizon radar network, JORN, can spot objects hundreds of miles away, far beyond the range of conventional radar.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even so, it’s not enough to just spot an uncrewed narco sub. Law enforcement also has to stop it—and that will be tricky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="man in naval uniform pointing at a map" class="wp-image-1132927" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/COLOMBIA-5.edit_.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;To find drone subs, international law enforcement will likely have to rely on networks of surveillance systems and, someday, swarms of their own drones.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CARLOS PARRA RIOS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a crewed vessel, Colombian doctrine says coast guard units should try to hail the boat first with lights, sirens, radio calls, and warning shots. If that fails, interceptor crews sometimes have to jump aboard and force the hatch. Officers worry that future autonomous craft could be wired to sink or even explode if someone gets too close. “If they get destroyed, we may lose the evidence,” says Víctor González Badrán, a navy captain and director of CMCON. “That means no seizure and no legal proceedings against that organization.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s where electronic warfare enters the picture—radio-frequency jamming, cyber tools, perhaps more exotic options. In the simplest version, jamming means flooding the receiver with noise so that commands from the operator never reach the vessel. Spoofing goes a step further, feeding fake signals so that the sub thinks it’s somewhere else or obediently follows a fake set of waypoints. Cyber tools might aim higher up the chain, trying to penetrate the software that runs the vessel or the networks it uses to talk to satellite constellations. At the cutting edge of these countermeasures are electromagnetic pulses designed to fry electronics outright, turning a million-dollar narco sub into a dead hull drifting at sea.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, the tools that might catch a future Tayrona sub are unevenly distributed, politically sensitive, and often experimental. Powerful cyber or electromagnetic tricks are closely guarded secrets; using them in a drug case risks exposing capabilities that militaries would rather reserve for wars. Systems like Australia’s JORN radar are tightly held national security assets, their exact performance specs classified, and sharing raw data with countries on the front lines of the cocaine trade would inevitably mean revealing hints as to how they got it. “Just because a capability exists doesn’t mean you employ it,” Knickerbocker says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Analysts don’t think uncrewed narco subs will reshape the global drug trade, despite the technological leap. Trafficking organizations will still hedge their bets across those three variables, hiding cocaine in shipping containers, dissolving it into liquids and paints, racing it north in fast boats. “I don’t think this is revolutionary,” Shuldiner says. “But it’s a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s still that chance, though, that everything international law enforcement agencies know about drug smuggling is about to change. González Zamudio says he keeps getting requests from foreign navies, coast guards, and security agencies to come see the Tayrona sub. He greets their delegations, takes them out to the strip of grass on the base, and walks them around it, gives them tours. It has become a kind of pilgrimage. Everyone who makes it worries that the next time a narco sub appears near a distant coastline, they’ll board it as usual, force the hatch—and find it full of cocaine and gadgets, but without a single human occupant. And no one knows what happens after that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eduardo Echeverri López is a journalist based in Colombia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a bright morning last April, a surveillance plane operated by the Colombian military spotted a 40-foot-long shark-like silhouette idling in the ocean just off Tayrona National Park. It was, unmistakably, a “narco sub,” a stealthy fiberglass vessel that sails with its hull almost entirely underwater, used by drug cartels to move cocaine north. The plane’s crew radioed it in, and eventually nearby coast guard boats got the order, routine but urgent: Intercept.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Cartagena, about 150 miles from the action, Captain Jaime González Zamudio, commander of the regional coast guard group, sat down at his desk to watch what happened next. On his computer monitor, icons representing his patrol boats raced toward the sub’s coordinates as updates crackled over his radio from the crews at sea. This was all standard; Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, and its navy has been seizing narco subs for decades. And so the captain was pretty sure what the outcome would be. His crew would catch up to the sub, just a bit of it showing above the water’s surface. They’d bring it to heel, board it, and force open the hatch to find two, three, maybe four exhausted men suffocating in a mix of diesel fumes and humidity, and a cargo compartment holding several tons of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boats caught up to the sub. A crew boarded, forced open the hatch, and confirmed that the vessel was secure. But from that point on, things were different.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, some unexpected details came over the radio: There was no cocaine on board. Neither was there a crew, nor a helm, nor even enough room for a person to lie down. Instead, inside the hull the crew found a fuel tank, an autopilot system and control electronics, and a remotely monitored security camera. González Zamudio’s crew started sending pictures back to Cartagena: Bolted to the hull was another camera, as well as two plastic rectangles, each about the size of a cookie sheet—antennas for connecting to Starlink satellite internet.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The authorities towed the boat back to Cartagena, where military techs took a closer look. Weeks later, they came to an unsettling conclusion: This was Colombia’s first confirmed &lt;em&gt;uncrewed&lt;/em&gt; narco sub. It could be operated by remote control, but it was also capable of some degree of autonomous travel. The techs concluded that the sub was likely a prototype built by the Clan del Golfo, a powerful criminal group that operates along the Caribbean coast.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. Law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what the Tayrona sub means for the future—whether it was merely an isolated experiment or the opening move in a new era of autonomous drug smuggling at sea.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Drug traffickers love the ocean. “You can move drug traffic through legal and illegal routes,” says Juan Pablo Serrano, a captain in the Colombian navy and head of the operational coordination center for Orión, a multiagency, multinational counternarcotics effort. The giant container ships at the heart of global commerce offer a favorite approach, Serrano says. Bribe a chain of dockworkers and inspectors, hide a load in one of thousands of cargo boxes, and put it on a totally legal commercial vessel headed to Europe or North America. That route is slow and expensive—involving months of transit and bribes spread across a wide network—but relatively low risk. “A ship can carry 5,000 containers. Good luck finding the right one,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Far less legal, but much faster and cheaper, are small, powerful motorboats. Quick to build and cheap to crew, these “go-fasts” top out at just under 50 feet long and can move smaller loads in hours rather than days. But they’re also easy for coastal radars and patrols to spot.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Submersibles—or, more accurately, “semisubmersibles”—fit somewhere in the middle. They take more money and engineering to build than an open speedboat, but they buy stealth—even if a bit of the vessel rides at the surface, the bulk stays hidden underwater. That adds another option to a portfolio that smugglers constantly rebalance across three variables: risk, time, and cost. When US and Colombian authorities tightened control over air routes and commercial shipping in the early 1990s, subs became more attractive. The first ones were crude wooden hulls with a fiberglass shell and extra fuel tanks, cobbled together in mangrove estuaries, hidden from prying eyes. Today’s fiberglass semisubmersible designs ride mostly below the surface, relying on diesel engines that can push multi-ton loads for days at a time while presenting little more than a ripple and a hot exhaust pipe to radar and infrared sensors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A typical semisubmersible costs under $2 million to build and can carry three metric tons of cocaine. That’s worth over $160 million in Europe—wholesale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most ferry between South American coasts and handoff points in Central America and Mexico, where allied criminal organizations break up the cargo and slowly funnel it toward the US. But some now go much farther. In 2019, Spanish authorities intercepted a semisubmersible after a 27-day transatlantic voyage from Brazil. In 2024, police in the Solomon Islands found the first narco sub in the Asia-Pacific region, a semisubmersible probably originating from Colombia on its way to Australia or New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the variables are risk, time, and cost, then the economics of a narco sub are simple. Even if they spend more time on the water than a powerboat, they’re less likely to get caught—and a relative bargain to produce. A narco sub might cost between $1&amp;nbsp;million and $2 million to build, but a kilo of cocaine costs just about $500 to make. “By the time that kilo reaches Europe, it can sell for between $44,000 and $55,000,” Serrano says. A typical semisubmersible carries up to three metric tons—cargo worth well over $160 million at European wholesale prices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;Off-the-shelf nautical autopilots, WiFi antennas, Starlink satellite internet connections, and remote cameras are all drug smugglers need to turn semisubmersibles into drone ships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, narco subs are getting more common. Seizures by authorities tripled in the last 20 years, according to Colombia’s International Center for Research and Analysis Against Maritime Drug Trafficking (CMCON), and Serrano admits that the Orión alliance has enough ships and aircraft to catch only a fraction of what sails.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until now, though, narco subs have had one major flaw: They depended on people, usually poor fishermen or low-level recruits sealed into stifling compartments for days at a time, steering by GPS and sight, hoping not to be spotted. That made the subs expensive and a risk to drug sellers if captured. Like good capitalists, the Tayrona boat’s builders seem to have been trying to obviate labor costs with automation. No crew means more room for drugs or fuel and no sailors to pay—or to get arrested or flip if a mission goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have a person or people on board, that makes the transoceanic routes much more feasible,” says Henry Shuldiner, a researcher at InSight Crime who has analyzed hundreds of narco-sub cases. It’s one thing, he notes, to persuade someone to spend a day or two going from Colombia to Panama for a big payout; it’s another to ask four people to spend three weeks sealed inside a cramped tube, sleeping, eating, and relieving themselves in the same space. “That’s a hard sell,” Shuldiner says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An uncrewed sub doesn’t have to race to a rendezvous because its crew can endure only a few days inside. It can move more slowly and stealthily. It can wait out patrols or bad weather, loiter near a meeting point, or take longer and less well-monitored routes. And if something goes wrong—if a military plane appears or navigation fails—its owners can simply scuttle the vessel from afar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the basic technology to make all that work is getting more and more affordable, and the potential profit margins are rising. “The rapidly approaching universality of autonomous technology could be a nightmare for the U.S. Coast Guard,” wrote two Coast Guard officers in the US Naval Institute’s journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; in 2021. And as if to prove how good an idea drone narco subs are, the US Marine Corps and the weapons builder Leidos are testing a low-profile uncrewed vessel called the Sea Specter, which they describe as being “inspired” by narco-sub design.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The possibility that drug smugglers are experimenting with autonomous subs isn’t just theoretical. Law enforcement agencies on other smuggling routes have found signs the Tayrona sub isn’t an isolated case. In 2022, Spanish police seized three small submersible drones near Cádiz, on Spain’s southern coast. Two years later, Italian authorities confiscated a remote-­controlled minisubmarine they believed was intended for drug runs. “The probability of expansion is high,” says Diego Cánovas, a port and maritime security expert in Spain. Tayrona, the biggest and most technologically advanced uncrewed narco sub found so far, is more likely a preview than an anomaly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the Tayrona semisubmersible sits on a strip of grass at the ARC Bolívar naval base in Cartagena.

And no one knows what happens after that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eduardo Echeverri López is a journalist based in Colombia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/19/1132619/uncrewed-narco-subs-transform-columbian-drug-trade/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Reliance unveils $110B AI investment plan as India ramps up tech ambitions (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/reliance-unveils-110b-ai-investment-plan-as-india-ramps-up-tech-ambitions/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reliance-mukesh-ambani.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Mukesh Ambani, the billionaire chairperson of Indian conglomerate Reliance, on Thursday unveiled the group’s ₹10 trillion (about $110 billion) plan to build AI computing infrastructure in India over the next seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Speaking at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Thursday, Ambani said the investment would fund gigawatt-scale data centers, a nationwide edge computing network, and new AI services integrated with Reliance’s Jio telecom platform.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Reliance has already begun construction of multi-gigawatt data centers in Jamnagar, Gujarat, Ambani said, and more than 120 megawatts of capacity is expected to come online in the second half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ambani’s pledge adds to a growing wave of AI investment in India. Earlier this week, Adani Group outlined plans to invest about $100 billion to build AI data centers in the country, and the Indian government expects more than $200 billion in AI infrastructure spending over the next two years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Global technology firms are also stepping up their presence, with OpenAI partnering with the Tata Group to develop about 100 megawatts of AI capacity in the country, and plans to scale that to 1 gigawatt eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ambani said the push is essential for India’s technological self-reliance, saying the country “cannot afford to rent intelligence,” and that Reliance aims to cut the cost of AI services as dramatically as it once reduced mobile data prices in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The biggest constraint in AI today is not talent or imagination,” Ambani said. “It is scarcity and high cost of compute.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The build-out, Ambani said, would be supported by Reliance’s green energy capacity, which stretches to 10 gigawatts of surplus power from solar projects in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Reliance will partner with Indian enterprises, startups, and academic institutions to embed AI in industries ranging from manufacturing and logistics to agriculture, healthcare and financial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jio has already been striking AI partnerships: it last year landed a deal with Google to offer free Gemini AI Pro access to millions of its users in India.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Reliance also plans to develop AI capabilities in several Indian languages to spur adoption of the tech, Ambani said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The aggressive push highlights how India’s largest conglomerates are racing to secure a foothold in what is expected to be one of the country’s biggest technology opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reliance-mukesh-ambani.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Mukesh Ambani, the billionaire chairperson of Indian conglomerate Reliance, on Thursday unveiled the group’s ₹10 trillion (about $110 billion) plan to build AI computing infrastructure in India over the next seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Executives at Freeform, a startup developing a novel 3D printing system for metal components, told TechCrunch that the company raised a $67 million Series B to expand its manufacturing platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Investors include Apandion, AE Ventures, Founders Fund, Linse Capital, NVidia’s NVentures , Threshold Ventures, and Two Sigma Ventures. FreeForm declined to disclose the company’s post-financing valuation, which Pitchbook cites as $179 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO and cofounder Erik Palitsch said the funding would allow the company to upgrade its current GoldenEye printing system, which uses 18 lasers to fuse metal powders into precision components, to a new version. Dubbed Skyfall, the next iteration of the platform would use hundreds of lasers to produce thousands of kilograms of metal parts each day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s the culmination of a vision Palitsch and co-founder/president Thomas Ronacher launched in 2018. The two met while developing rocket engines at SpaceX, where they found that industrial machines for printing metal components are expensive, finicky, and not well designed for mass manufacturing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Their new company would build its platform from the ground up to achieve higher throughput and flexibility, with an emphasis on active software controls. Palitsch says Freeform’s platform is “AI native,” noting a partnership with Nvidia that allows the company to access advanced GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think we’re the only quote-unquote manufacturing company out there that has H200 clusters in a data center on site,” Paltisch told TechCrunch. “What are they doing? We’re running real-time physics-based simulations and learning all the different aspects of the end to end manufacturing workflow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The data collected by sensors in the company’s manufacturing platform and during the simulations allows Freeform to rapidly improve production quality and quantity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have more meaningful data on the physics of the metal-printing process than any company in the world,” head of talent Cameron Kay said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Palitsch said he could not disclose any customers, he said the company is already delivering hundreds of “mission-critical” parts to buyers. Now, the company wants to hire as many as 100 new employees and expand its facility to start executing on its contract backlog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Manufacturing-as-a-service has grown as a category as venture investors have taken a greater interest in building vehicles, robots, and energy production systems.
