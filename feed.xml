These features include an AI-driven collage, “Styled for you,” that helps users create outfits from saved fashion Pins, and “Boards made for you,” which are personalized boards curated with AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Styled for you” collages allow users to combine different clothing and accessories to create new outfits tailored to their individual style preferences. By tapping an item in the collage, users can swipe through AI-recommended saved pins for mixing and matching.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pinterest is also testing “Boards made for you,” personalized boards curated from a blend of editorial input and AI-powered suggestions. These boards —featuring trending styles, weekly outfit inspiration, and shoppable content — will be featured in users’ home feeds and in their inboxes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is initially experimenting with the AI features in the U.S. and Canada. They’ll start rolling out in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062515" height="452" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pinterest_Boardsforyou.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says the aim of these AI features is to evolve Pinterest boards from mere organizational tools into a more personalized way to explore, shop, and find outfit inspiration. This initiative aligns with Pinterest’s goal to position itself as an “AI-enabled shopping assistant,” as indicated by the CEO during the company’s second-quarter earnings call. Pinterest has already integrated AI in various ways, including AI-driven recommendations and visual search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, while the platform is introducing more AI features on the one hand, it’s also trying to keep AI-generated content off its platform on the other. In April, the company announced its plan to label AI-generated and AI-modified images. It also introduced controls that let users reduce the number of AI-generated Pins they see in their feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to the new AI experiments, there will be new tabs that sort Pins into categories, accessible by viewing boards from user profiles. These updates are set to roll out globally in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the new tabs, called “Make It Yours,” will recommend fashion and home decor products based on a user’s saved Pins. The “More Ideas” tab will suggest related Pins across categories such as beauty, recipes, and art. Lastly, an “All Saves” tab will let users easily find all their previously saved Pins.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Pinterest announced on Monday new AI-powered upgrades to its boards to make them more personalized for users.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Felicis Ventures, which led the company’s previous $100 million Series B at a $2 billion valuation, is also leading this round. Existing investors Benchmark and General Catalyst, and new investor Robinhood Ventures also participated.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch reported in September that Mercor was in talks with investors to raise a Series C at a valuation of $10 billion, up from its target of $8 billion a few months prior. The company at the time told potential investors that it already had multiple offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor started off as an AI-driven hiring platform but quickly pivoted to providing companies with specialized domain experts to perform AI model training — such as scientists, doctors, and lawyers — and charging an hourly finder’s fee and matching rate for their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has also been adding more software infrastructure for reinforcement learning — a training method where a model’s or agent’s decisions are verified or disputed, enabling it to incorporate feedback and improve over time. The company intends to eventually build an AI-powered recruiting marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor’s fortunes rose after leading AI labs like OpenAI and Google DeepMind reportedly cut ties with data-labeling startup Scale AI after Meta invested $14 billion in the data vendor and hired its CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company apparently told investors that it’s on track to hit $500 million in ARR faster than Anysphere, the startup behind Cursor, which famously hit the milestone roughly a year after launching its core product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Since we founded Mercor almost three years ago, AI has advanced at an astonishing pace. But it still struggles with the subtleties that drive economically valuable work — balancing trade-offs, understanding intent, developing taste, and deciding what should be done, not just what can be done,” the company wrote in a blog post emailed to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup says it currently pays more than $1.5 million per day to its contractors. It has more than 30,000 experts on its roster, who earn over $85 per hour on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor said it will focus on three areas: expanding its talent network, improving its systems for matching its contractors with clients, and building new products to automate more of its processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_9747_3d5c52.jpeg?resize=1200,960" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Mercor, which connects AI labs with domain experts for training their foundational AI models, has raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Felicis Ventures, which led the company’s previous $100 million Series B at a $2 billion valuation, is also leading this round. Existing investors Benchmark and General Catalyst, and new investor Robinhood Ventures also participated.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch reported in September that Mercor was in talks with investors to raise a Series C at a valuation of $10 billion, up from its target of $8 billion a few months prior. The company at the time told potential investors that it already had multiple offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor started off as an AI-driven hiring platform but quickly pivoted to providing companies with specialized domain experts to perform AI model training — such as scientists, doctors, and lawyers — and charging an hourly finder’s fee and matching rate for their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has also been adding more software infrastructure for reinforcement learning — a training method where a model’s or agent’s decisions are verified or disputed, enabling it to incorporate feedback and improve over time. The company intends to eventually build an AI-powered recruiting marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor’s fortunes rose after leading AI labs like OpenAI and Google DeepMind reportedly cut ties with data-labeling startup Scale AI after Meta invested $14 billion in the data vendor and hired its CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company apparently told investors that it’s on track to hit $500 million in ARR faster than Anysphere, the startup behind Cursor, which famously hit the milestone roughly a year after launching its core product.&lt;/p&gt;

Excel remains the lingua franca of finance, the digital workspace where analysts spend countless hours constructing financial models, running valuations, and stress-testing assumptions. By embedding Claude into this environment, Anthropic is meeting financial professionals exactly where they work rather than asking them to toggle between applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude for Excel allows users to work with the AI in a sidebar where it can read, analyze, modify, and create new Excel workbooks while providing full transparency about the actions it takes by tracking and explaining changes and letting users navigate directly to referenced cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transparency feature addresses one of the most persistent anxieties around AI in finance: &lt;a href="https://umdearborn.edu/news/ais-mysterious-black-box-problem-explained"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; problem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When billions of dollars ride on a financial model&amp;#x27;s output, analysts need to understand not just the answer but how the AI arrived at it. By showing its work at the cell level, Anthropic is attempting to build the trust necessary for widespread adoption in an industry where careers and fortunes can turn on a misplaced decimal point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical implementation is sophisticated. Claude can discuss how spreadsheets work, modify them while preserving formula dependencies — a notoriously complex task — debug cell formulas, populate templates with new data, or build entirely new spreadsheets from scratch. This isn&amp;#x27;t merely a chatbot that answers questions about your data; it&amp;#x27;s a collaborative tool that can actively manipulate the models that drive investment decisions worth trillions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Anthropic is building data moats around its financial AI platform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more significant than the Excel integration is Anthropic&amp;#x27;s expansion of its connector ecosystem, which now links Claude to live market data and proprietary research from financial information giants. The company added six major new data partnerships spanning the entire spectrum of financial information that professional investors rely upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aiera.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Aiera&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now provides Claude with real-time earnings call transcripts and summaries of investor events like shareholder meetings, presentations, and conferences. The Aiera connector also enables a data feed from &lt;a href="https://www.thirdbridge.com/en-us"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Third Bridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which gives Claude access to a library of insights interviews, company intelligence, and industry analysis from experts and former executives. &lt;a href="https://www.chronograph.pe/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chronograph&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives private equity investors operational and financial information for portfolio monitoring and conducting due diligence, including performance metrics, valuations, and fund-level data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.egnyte.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Egnyte&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enables Claude to securely search permitted data for internal data rooms, investment documents, and approved financial models while maintaining governed access controls. &lt;a href="https://www.lseg.com/en"&gt;&lt;u&gt;LSEG&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the London Stock Exchange Group, connects Claude to live market data including fixed income pricing, equities, foreign exchange rates, macroeconomic indicators, and analysts&amp;#x27; estimates of other important financial metrics. &lt;a href="https://www.moodys.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Moody&amp;#x27;s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides access to proprietary credit ratings, research, and company data covering ownership, financials, and news on more than 600 million public and private companies, supporting work and research in compliance, credit analysis, and business development. &lt;a href="https://www.mtnewswires.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MT Newswires&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides Claude with access to the latest global multi-asset class news on financial markets and economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These partnerships amount to a land grab for the informational infrastructure that powers modern finance. Previously announced in July, Anthropic had &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services"&gt;&lt;u&gt;already secured integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.capitaliq.com/CIQDotNet/Login-okta.aspx"&gt;&lt;u&gt;S&amp;amp;P Capital IQ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://daloopa.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daloopa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.morningstar.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Morningstar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.factset.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FactSet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pitchbook.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PitchBook&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Snowflake&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.databricks.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Databricks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Together, these connectors give Claude access to virtually every category of financial data an analyst might need: fundamental company data, market prices, credit assessments, private company intelligence, alternative data, and breaking news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters because the quality of AI outputs depends entirely on the quality of inputs. Generic large language models trained on public internet data simply cannot compete with systems that have direct pipelines to Bloomberg-quality financial information. By securing these partnerships, Anthropic is building moats around its financial services offering that competitors will find difficult to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic calculus here is clear: Anthropic is betting that domain-specific AI systems with privileged access to proprietary data will outcompete general-purpose AI assistants. It&amp;#x27;s a direct challenge to the &amp;quot;one AI to rule them all&amp;quot; approach favored by some competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pre-configured workflows target the daily grind of Wall Street analysts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third pillar of Anthropic&amp;#x27;s announcement involves six new &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agent Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — pre-configured workflows for common financial tasks. These skills are Anthropic&amp;#x27;s attempt to productize the workflows of entry-level and mid-level financial analysts, professionals who spend their days building models, processing due diligence documents, and writing research reports. Anthropic has designed skills specifically to automate these time-consuming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new skills include building discounted cash flow models complete with full free cash flow projections, weighted average cost of capital calculations, scenario toggles, and sensitivity tables. There&amp;#x27;s comparable company analysis featuring valuation multiples and operating metrics that can be easily refreshed with updated data. Claude can now process data room documents into Excel spreadsheets populated with financial information, customer lists, and contract terms. It can create company teasers and profiles for pitch books and buyer lists, perform earnings analyses that use quarterly transcripts and financials to extract important metrics, guidance changes, and management commentary, and produce initiating coverage reports with industry analysis, company deep dives, and valuation frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s worth noting that Anthropic&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sonnet 4.5 model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now tops the &lt;a href="https://www.vals.ai/benchmarks/finance_agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Finance Agent benchmark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Vals AI at 55.3% accuracy, a metric designed to test AI systems on tasks expected of entry-level financial analysts. A 55% accuracy rate might sound underwhelming, but it is state-of-the-art performance and highlights both the promise and limitations of AI in finance. The technology can clearly handle sophisticated analytical tasks, but it&amp;#x27;s not yet reliable enough to operate autonomously without human oversight — a reality that may actually reassure both regulators and the analysts whose jobs might otherwise be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agent Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approach is particularly clever because it packages AI capabilities in terms that financial institutions already understand. Rather than selling generic &amp;quot;AI assistance,&amp;quot; Anthropic is offering solutions to specific, well-defined problems: &amp;quot;You need a DCF model? We have a skill for that. You need to analyze earnings calls? We have a skill for that too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trillion-dollar clients are already seeing massive productivity gains&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services strategy appears to be gaining traction with exactly the kind of marquee clients that matter in enterprise sales. The company counts among its clients &lt;a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/artificial-intelligence"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIA Labs at Bridgewater&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Commonwealth Bank of Australia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.aig.com/home"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American International Group&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbim.no/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norges Bank Investment Management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — Norway&amp;#x27;s $1.6 trillion sovereign wealth fund, one of the world&amp;#x27;s largest institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBIM CEO Nicolai Tangen reported achieving approximately 20% productivity gains, equivalent to 213,000 hours, with portfolio managers and risk departments now able to &amp;quot;seamlessly query our Snowflake data warehouse and analyze earnings calls with unprecedented efficiency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At AIG, CEO Peter Zaffino said the partnership has &amp;quot;compressed the timeline to review business by more than 5x in our early rollouts while simultaneously improving our data accuracy from 75% to over 90%.&amp;quot; If these numbers hold across broader deployments, the productivity implications for the financial services industry are staggering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;#x27;t pilot programs or proof-of-concept deployments; they&amp;#x27;re production implementations at institutions managing trillions of dollars in assets and making underwriting decisions that affect millions of customers. Their public endorsements provide the social proof that typically drives enterprise adoption in conservative industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regulatory uncertainty creates both opportunity and risk for AI deployment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services ambitions unfold against a backdrop of heightened regulatory scrutiny and shifting enforcement priorities. In 2023, the &lt;a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-guidance-on-credit-denials-by-lenders-using-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; released guidance requiring lenders to &amp;quot;use specific and accurate reasons when taking adverse actions against consumers&amp;quot; involving AI, and issued additional guidance requiring regulated entities to &amp;quot;evaluate their underwriting models for bias&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;evaluate automated collateral-valuation and appraisal processes in ways that minimize bias.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/recommendations-for-responsible-use-of-ai-in-financial-services/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brookings Institution analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these measures have since been revoked with work stopped or eliminated at the current downsized CFPB under the current administration, creating regulatory uncertainty. The pendulum has swung from the Biden administration&amp;#x27;s cautious approach, exemplified by an &lt;a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;executive order on safe AI development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, toward the Trump administration&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;America&amp;#x27;s AI Action Plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; which seeks to &amp;quot;cement U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence&amp;quot; through deregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This regulatory flux creates both opportunities and risks. Financial institutions eager to deploy AI now face less prescriptive federal oversight, potentially accelerating adoption. But the absence of clear guardrails also exposes them to potential liability if AI systems produce discriminatory outcomes, particularly in lending and underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Attorney General recently reached a &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-campbell-announces-25-million-settlement-with-student-loan-lender-for-unlawful-practices-through-ai-use-other-consumer-protection-violations"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$2.5 million settlement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with student loan company Earnest Operations, alleging that its use of AI models resulted in &amp;quot;disparate impact in approval rates and loan terms, specifically disadvantaging Black and Hispanic applicants.&amp;quot; Such cases will likely multiply as AI deployment grows, creating a patchwork of state-level enforcement even as federal oversight recedes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic appears acutely aware of these risks. In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/anthropic-rolls-out-financial-ai-tools-target-large-clients-claude/753249/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Banking Dive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jonathan Pelosi, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s global head of industry for financial services, emphasized that Claude requires a &amp;quot;human in the loop.&amp;quot; The platform, he said, is not intended for autonomous financial decision-making or to provide stock recommendations that users follow blindly. During client onboarding, Pelosi told the publication, Anthropic focuses on training and understanding model limitations, putting guardrails in place so people treat Claude as a helpful technology rather than a replacement for human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competition heats up as every major tech company targets finance AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services push comes as AI competition intensifies across the enterprise. &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/?zx=1761550720312&amp;amp;no_sw_cr=1"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and numerous startups are all vying for position in what may become one of AI&amp;#x27;s most lucrative verticals. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/21/goldman-sachs-launches-ai-assistant.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; introduced a generative AI assistant to its bankers, traders, and asset managers in January, signaling that major banks may build their own capabilities rather than rely exclusively on third-party providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of domain-specific AI models like &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BloombergGPT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — trained specifically on financial data — suggests the market may fragment between generalized AI assistants and specialized tools. Anthropic&amp;#x27;s strategy appears to stake out a middle ground: general-purpose models, since Claude was not trained exclusively on financial data, enhanced with financial-specific tooling, data access, and workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s partnership strategy with implementation consultancies including &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deloitte&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kpmg.com/xx/en.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;KPMG&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/leadingedge.html?WT.mc_id=CT3-PL300-DM1-TR1-BR_XB_-OTHERFW_-Brand_Umbrella_Google&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22496735884&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAABTtm-J1jFUwZ3oXf5hR5VenXYQfh&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsPzHBhDCARIsALlWNG0UNXvoWOQLTYylq3foXvjRNwHOD6SRzXaav5gXQG2APeHyRz5Us34aAn0lEALw_wcB"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PwC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.slalom.com/us/en"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Slalom&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tribe.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TribeAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.turing.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is equally critical. These firms serve as force multipliers, embedding Anthropic&amp;#x27;s technology into their own service offerings and providing the change management expertise that financial institutions need to successfully adopt AI at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;CFOs worry about AI hallucinations and cascading errors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader question is whether AI tools like Claude will genuinely transform financial services productivity or merely shift work around. The PYMNTS Intelligence report &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study_posts/the-agentic-trust-gap-enterprise-cfos-push-pause-on-agentic-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Agentic Trust Gap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; found that chief financial officers remain hesitant about AI agents, with &amp;quot;nagging concern&amp;quot; about hallucinations where &amp;quot;an AI agent can go off script and expose firms to cascading payment errors and other inaccuracies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For finance leaders, the message is stark: Harness AI&amp;#x27;s momentum now, but build the guardrails before the next quarterly call—or risk owning the fallout,&amp;quot; the report warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://kpmg.com/kpmg-us/content/dam/kpmg/boardleadership/pdf/2025/2025-survey-boardroom-lens-generative-ai.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2025 KPMG report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that 70% of board members have developed responsible use policies for employees, with other popular initiatives including implementing a recognized AI risk and governance framework, developing ethical guidelines and training programs for AI developers, and conducting regular AI use audits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial services industry faces a delicate balancing act: move too slowly and risk competitive disadvantage as rivals achieve productivity gains; move too quickly and risk operational failures, regulatory penalties, or reputational damage. Speaking at the &lt;a href="https://evidentinsights.com/events/evident-ai-symposium-new-york-2025/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Evident AI Symposium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in New York last week, Ian Glasner, HSBC&amp;#x27;s group head of emerging technology, innovation and ventures, struck an optimistic tone about the sector&amp;#x27;s readiness for AI adoption. &amp;quot;As an industry, we are very well prepared to manage risk,&amp;quot; he said, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/agentic-ai-governance-risk-mitigation-financial-services-banks/803667/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CIO Dive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;Let&amp;#x27;s not overcomplicate this. We just need to be focused on the business use case and the value associated.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s latest moves suggest the company sees financial services as a beachhead market where AI&amp;#x27;s value proposition is clear, customers have deep pockets, and the technical requirements play to Claude&amp;#x27;s strengths in reasoning and accuracy. By building Excel integration, securing data partnerships, and pre-packaging common workflows, Anthropic is reducing the friction that typically slows enterprise AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-e-at-usd61-5b-post-money-valuation"&gt;&lt;u&gt; $61.5 billion valuation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the company commanded in its March fundraising round — up from roughly $16 billion a year earlier — suggests investors believe this strategy will work. But the real test will come as these tools move from pilot programs to production deployments across thousands of analysts and billions of dollars in transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial services may prove to be AI&amp;#x27;s most demanding proving ground: an industry where mistakes are costly, regulation is stringent, and trust is everything. If Claude can successfully navigate the spreadsheet cells and data feeds of Wall Street without hallucinating a decimal point in the wrong direction, Anthropic will have accomplished something far more valuable than winning another benchmark test. It will have proven that AI can be trusted with the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://anthropic.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anthropic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is making its most aggressive push yet into the trillion-dollar financial services industry, unveiling a suite of tools that embed its &lt;a href="http://claude.ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; assistant directly into &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft Excel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and connect it to real-time market data from some of the world&amp;#x27;s most influential financial information providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based AI startup announced Monday it is releasing &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/advancing-claude-for-financial-services"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude for Excel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, allowing financial analysts to interact with the AI system directly within their spreadsheets — the quintessential tool of modern finance. &lt;!-- --&gt;Beyond Excel, select Claude models are also being made available in &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio?market=af"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft Copilot Studio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/03/25/introducing-researcher-and-analyst-in-microsoft-365-copilot/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Researcher agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, expanding the integration across Microsoft&amp;#x27;s enterprise AI ecosystem. &lt;!-- --&gt;The integration marks a significant escalation in Anthropic&amp;#x27;s campaign to position itself as the AI platform of choice for banks, asset managers, and insurance companies, markets where precision and regulatory compliance matter far more than creative flair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expansion comes just three months after Anthropic launched its &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Financial Analysis Solution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in July, and it signals the company&amp;#x27;s determination to capture market share in an industry &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/recommendations-for-responsible-use-of-ai-in-financial-services/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;projected to spend $97 billion on AI by 2027&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, up from $35 billion in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, it positions Anthropic to compete directly with &lt;a href="https://microsoft.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — ironically, its partner in this Excel integration — which has its own &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel/ai-for-excel"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot AI assistant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; embedded across its &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Office suite&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which counts &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/technology/openai-microsoft-deal.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft as its largest investor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Excel has become the new battleground for AI in finance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to build directly into Excel is hardly accidental. Excel remains the lingua franca of finance, the digital workspace where analysts spend countless hours constructing financial models, running valuations, and stress-testing assumptions. By embedding Claude into this environment, Anthropic is meeting financial professionals exactly where they work rather than asking them to toggle between applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude for Excel allows users to work with the AI in a sidebar where it can read, analyze, modify, and create new Excel workbooks while providing full transparency about the actions it takes by tracking and explaining changes and letting users navigate directly to referenced cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transparency feature addresses one of the most persistent anxieties around AI in finance: &lt;a href="https://umdearborn.edu/news/ais-mysterious-black-box-problem-explained"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; problem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When billions of dollars ride on a financial model&amp;#x27;s output, analysts need to understand not just the answer but how the AI arrived at it. By showing its work at the cell level, Anthropic is attempting to build the trust necessary for widespread adoption in an industry where careers and fortunes can turn on a misplaced decimal point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical implementation is sophisticated. Claude can discuss how spreadsheets work, modify them while preserving formula dependencies — a notoriously complex task — debug cell formulas, populate templates with new data, or build entirely new spreadsheets from scratch. This isn&amp;#x27;t merely a chatbot that answers questions about your data; it&amp;#x27;s a collaborative tool that can actively manipulate the models that drive investment decisions worth trillions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Anthropic is building data moats around its financial AI platform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more significant than the Excel integration is Anthropic&amp;#x27;s expansion of its connector ecosystem, which now links Claude to live market data and proprietary research from financial information giants. The company added six major new data partnerships spanning the entire spectrum of financial information that professional investors rely upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aiera.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Aiera&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now provides Claude with real-time earnings call transcripts and summaries of investor events like shareholder meetings, presentations, and conferences. The Aiera connector also enables a data feed from &lt;a href="https://www.thirdbridge.com/en-us"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Third Bridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which gives Claude access to a library of insights interviews, company intelligence, and industry analysis from experts and former executives. &lt;a href="https://www.chronograph.pe/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chronograph&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives private equity investors operational and financial information for portfolio monitoring and conducting due diligence, including performance metrics, valuations, and fund-level data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.egnyte.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Egnyte&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enables Claude to securely search permitted data for internal data rooms, investment documents, and approved financial models while maintaining governed access controls. &lt;a href="https://www.lseg.com/en"&gt;&lt;u&gt;LSEG&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the London Stock Exchange Group, connects Claude to live market data including fixed income pricing, equities, foreign exchange rates, macroeconomic indicators, and analysts&amp;#x27; estimates of other important financial metrics. &lt;a href="https://www.moodys.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Moody&amp;#x27;s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides access to proprietary credit ratings, research, and company data covering ownership, financials, and news on more than 600 million public and private companies, supporting work and research in compliance, credit analysis, and business development. &lt;a href="https://www.mtnewswires.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MT Newswires&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides Claude with access to the latest global multi-asset class news on financial markets and economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These partnerships amount to a land grab for the informational infrastructure that powers modern finance. Previously announced in July, Anthropic had &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services"&gt;&lt;u&gt;already secured integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.capitaliq.com/CIQDotNet/Login-okta.aspx"&gt;&lt;u&gt;S&amp;amp;P Capital IQ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://daloopa.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daloopa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.morningstar.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Morningstar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.factset.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FactSet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pitchbook.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PitchBook&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Snowflake&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.databricks.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Databricks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Together, these connectors give Claude access to virtually every category of financial data an analyst might need: fundamental company data, market prices, credit assessments, private company intelligence, alternative data, and breaking news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters because the quality of AI outputs depends entirely on the quality of inputs. Generic large language models trained on public internet data simply cannot compete with systems that have direct pipelines to Bloomberg-quality financial information. By securing these partnerships, Anthropic is building moats around its financial services offering that competitors will find difficult to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic calculus here is clear: Anthropic is betting that domain-specific AI systems with privileged access to proprietary data will outcompete general-purpose AI assistants. It&amp;#x27;s a direct challenge to the &amp;quot;one AI to rule them all&amp;quot; approach favored by some competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pre-configured workflows target the daily grind of Wall Street analysts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third pillar of Anthropic&amp;#x27;s announcement involves six new &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agent Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — pre-configured workflows for common financial tasks. These skills are Anthropic&amp;#x27;s attempt to productize the workflows of entry-level and mid-level financial analysts, professionals who spend their days building models, processing due diligence documents, and writing research reports. Anthropic has designed skills specifically to automate these time-consuming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new skills include building discounted cash flow models complete with full free cash flow projections, weighted average cost of capital calculations, scenario toggles, and sensitivity tables. There&amp;#x27;s comparable company analysis featuring valuation multiples and operating metrics that can be easily refreshed with updated data. Claude can now process data room documents into Excel spreadsheets populated with financial information, customer lists, and contract terms. It can create company teasers and profiles for pitch books and buyer lists, perform earnings analyses that use quarterly transcripts and financials to extract important metrics, guidance changes, and management commentary, and produce initiating coverage reports with industry analysis, company deep dives, and valuation frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s worth noting that Anthropic&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sonnet 4.5 model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now tops the &lt;a href="https://www.vals.ai/benchmarks/finance_agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Finance Agent benchmark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Vals AI at 55.3% accuracy, a metric designed to test AI systems on tasks expected of entry-level financial analysts. A 55% accuracy rate might sound underwhelming, but it is state-of-the-art performance and highlights both the promise and limitations of AI in finance. The technology can clearly handle sophisticated analytical tasks, but it&amp;#x27;s not yet reliable enough to operate autonomously without human oversight — a reality that may actually reassure both regulators and the analysts whose jobs might otherwise be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agent Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approach is particularly clever because it packages AI capabilities in terms that financial institutions already understand. Rather than selling generic &amp;quot;AI assistance,&amp;quot; Anthropic is offering solutions to specific, well-defined problems: &amp;quot;You need a DCF model? We have a skill for that. You need to analyze earnings calls? We have a skill for that too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trillion-dollar clients are already seeing massive productivity gains&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services strategy appears to be gaining traction with exactly the kind of marquee clients that matter in enterprise sales. The company counts among its clients &lt;a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/artificial-intelligence"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIA Labs at Bridgewater&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Commonwealth Bank of Australia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.aig.com/home"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American International Group&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbim.no/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norges Bank Investment Management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — Norway&amp;#x27;s $1.6 trillion sovereign wealth fund, one of the world&amp;#x27;s largest institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBIM CEO Nicolai Tangen reported achieving approximately 20% productivity gains, equivalent to 213,000 hours, with portfolio managers and risk departments now able to &amp;quot;seamlessly query our Snowflake data warehouse and analyze earnings calls with unprecedented efficiency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At AIG, CEO Peter Zaffino said the partnership has &amp;quot;compressed the timeline to review business by more than 5x in our early rollouts while simultaneously improving our data accuracy from 75% to over 90%.&amp;quot; If these numbers hold across broader deployments, the productivity implications for the financial services industry are staggering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;#x27;t pilot programs or proof-of-concept deployments; they&amp;#x27;re production implementations at institutions managing trillions of dollars in assets and making underwriting decisions that affect millions of customers. Their public endorsements provide the social proof that typically drives enterprise adoption in conservative industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regulatory uncertainty creates both opportunity and risk for AI deployment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services ambitions unfold against a backdrop of heightened regulatory scrutiny and shifting enforcement priorities. In 2023, the &lt;a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-guidance-on-credit-denials-by-lenders-using-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; released guidance requiring lenders to &amp;quot;use specific and accurate reasons when taking adverse actions against consumers&amp;quot; involving AI, and issued additional guidance requiring regulated entities to &amp;quot;evaluate their underwriting models for bias&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;evaluate automated collateral-valuation and appraisal processes in ways that minimize bias.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/recommendations-for-responsible-use-of-ai-in-financial-services/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brookings Institution analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these measures have since been revoked with work stopped or eliminated at the current downsized CFPB under the current administration, creating regulatory uncertainty. The pendulum has swung from the Biden administration&amp;#x27;s cautious approach, exemplified by an &lt;a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;executive order on safe AI development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, toward the Trump administration&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;America&amp;#x27;s AI Action Plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; which seeks to &amp;quot;cement U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence&amp;quot; through deregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This regulatory flux creates both opportunities and risks. Financial institutions eager to deploy AI now face less prescriptive federal oversight, potentially accelerating adoption. But the absence of clear guardrails also exposes them to potential liability if AI systems produce discriminatory outcomes, particularly in lending and underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Attorney General recently reached a &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-campbell-announces-25-million-settlement-with-student-loan-lender-for-unlawful-practices-through-ai-use-other-consumer-protection-violations"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$2.5 million settlement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with student loan company Earnest Operations, alleging that its use of AI models resulted in &amp;quot;disparate impact in approval rates and loan terms, specifically disadvantaging Black and Hispanic applicants.&amp;quot; Such cases will likely multiply as AI deployment grows, creating a patchwork of state-level enforcement even as federal oversight recedes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic appears acutely aware of these risks. In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/anthropic-rolls-out-financial-ai-tools-target-large-clients-claude/753249/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Banking Dive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jonathan Pelosi, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s global head of industry for financial services, emphasized that Claude requires a &amp;quot;human in the loop.&amp;quot; The platform, he said, is not intended for autonomous financial decision-making or to provide stock recommendations that users follow blindly. During client onboarding, Pelosi told the publication, Anthropic focuses on training and understanding model limitations, putting guardrails in place so people treat Claude as a helpful technology rather than a replacement for human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competition heats up as every major tech company targets finance AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services push comes as AI competition intensifies across the enterprise. &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/?zx=1761550720312&amp;amp;no_sw_cr=1"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and numerous startups are all vying for position in what may become one of AI&amp;#x27;s most lucrative verticals. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/21/goldman-sachs-launches-ai-assistant.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; introduced a generative AI assistant to its bankers, traders, and asset managers in January, signaling that major banks may build their own capabilities rather than rely exclusively on third-party providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of domain-specific AI models like &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BloombergGPT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — trained specifically on financial data — suggests the market may fragment between generalized AI assistants and specialized tools. Anthropic&amp;#x27;s strategy appears to stake out a middle ground: general-purpose models, since Claude was not trained exclusively on financial data, enhanced with financial-specific tooling, data access, and workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s partnership strategy with implementation consultancies including &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deloitte&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kpmg.com/xx/en.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;KPMG&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/leadingedge.html?WT.mc_id=CT3-PL300-DM1-TR1-BR_XB_-OTHERFW_-Brand_Umbrella_Google&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22496735884&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAABTtm-J1jFUwZ3oXf5hR5VenXYQfh&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsPzHBhDCARIsALlWNG0UNXvoWOQLTYylq3foXvjRNwHOD6SRzXaav5gXQG2APeHyRz5Us34aAn0lEALw_wcB"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PwC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.slalom.com/us/en"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Slalom&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tribe.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TribeAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.turing.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is equally critical. These firms serve as force multipliers, embedding Anthropic&amp;#x27;s technology into their own service offerings and providing the change management expertise that financial institutions need to successfully adopt AI at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;CFOs worry about AI hallucinations and cascading errors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader question is whether AI tools like Claude will genuinely transform financial services productivity or merely shift work around. The PYMNTS Intelligence report &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study_posts/the-agentic-trust-gap-enterprise-cfos-push-pause-on-agentic-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Agentic Trust Gap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; found that chief financial officers remain hesitant about AI agents, with &amp;quot;nagging concern&amp;quot; about hallucinations where &amp;quot;an AI agent can go off script and expose firms to cascading payment errors and other inaccuracies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For finance leaders, the message is stark: Harness AI&amp;#x27;s momentum now, but build the guardrails before the next quarterly call—or risk owning the fallout,&amp;quot; the report warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://kpmg.com/kpmg-us/content/dam/kpmg/boardleadership/pdf/2025/2025-survey-boardroom-lens-generative-ai.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2025 KPMG report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that 70% of board members have developed responsible use policies for employees, with other popular initiatives including implementing a recognized AI risk and governance framework, developing ethical guidelines and training programs for AI developers, and conducting regular AI use audits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial services industry faces a delicate balancing act: move too slowly and risk competitive disadvantage as rivals achieve productivity gains; move too quickly and risk operational failures, regulatory penalties, or reputational damage. Speaking at the &lt;a href="https://evidentinsights.com/events/evident-ai-symposium-new-york-2025/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Evident AI Symposium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in New York last week, Ian Glasner, HSBC&amp;#x27;s group head of emerging technology, innovation and ventures, struck an optimistic tone about the sector&amp;#x27;s readiness for AI adoption. &amp;quot;As an industry, we are very well prepared to manage risk,&amp;quot; he said, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/agentic-ai-governance-risk-mitigation-financial-services-banks/803667/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CIO Dive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;Let&amp;#x27;s not overcomplicate this. We just need to be focused on the business use case and the value associated.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s latest moves suggest the company sees financial services as a beachhead market where AI&amp;#x27;s value proposition is clear, customers have deep pockets, and the technical requirements play to Claude&amp;#x27;s strengths in reasoning and accuracy. By building Excel integration, securing data partnerships, and pre-packaging common workflows, Anthropic is reducing the friction that typically slows enterprise AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-e-at-usd61-5b-post-money-valuation"&gt;&lt;u&gt; $61.5 billion valuation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the company commanded in its March fundraising round — up from roughly $16 billion a year earlier — suggests investors believe this strategy will work. But the real test will come as these tools move from pilot programs to production deployments across thousands of analysts and billions of dollars in transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial services may prove to be AI&amp;#x27;s most demanding proving ground: an industry where mistakes are costly, regulation is stringent, and trust is everything. If Claude can successfully navigate the spreadsheet cells and data feeds of Wall Street without hallucinating a decimal point in the wrong direction, Anthropic will have accomplished something far more valuable than winning another benchmark test. It will have proven that AI can be trusted with the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The scans help doctors detect cancer and track its spread, but the process itself is a logistical nightmare for patients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It starts with fasting for four to six hours before coming into the hospital — and good luck to you if you live rurally and your local hospital doesn’t have a PET scanner. When you get to the hospital, you’re injected with radioactive material, after which you must wait an hour while it washes through your body. Next, you enter the PET scanner and have to attempt to lie still for 30 minutes while radiologists acquire the image. After that, you have to keep physically away from the elderly, young people, and pregnant women for up to 12 hours because you’re literally semi-radioactive. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another bottleneck? PET scanners are concentrated in major cities because their radioactive tracers must be produced in nearby cyclotrons — compact nuclear machines — and used within hours, limiting access in rural and regional hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But what if you could use AI to convert CT scans, which are much more accessible and affordable, into PET scans? That’s the pitch of RADiCAIT, an Oxford spinout that came out of stealth this month with $1.7 million in pre-seed financing. The Boston-based startup, which is a Top 20 finalist in Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, has just opened a $5 million raise to advance its clinical trials. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What we really do is we took the most constrained, complex, and costly medical imaging solution in radiology, and we supplanted it with what is the most accessible, simple and affordable, which is CT,” Sean Walsh, RADiCAIT’s CEO, told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RADiCAIT’s secret sauce is its foundational model — a generative deep neural network invented in 2021 at the University of Oxford by a team led by the startup’s co-founder and chief medical information officer, Regent Lee. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062164" height="258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Left: CT scan. Middle: AI-generated PET scan from RADiCAIT.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The model learns by comparing CT and PET scans, mapping them, and picking out patterns in how they relate to each other. Sina Shahandeh, RADiCAIT’s chief technologist, describes it as connecting “distinct physical phenomena” by translating anatomical structure into physiological function. Then the model is directed to pay extra attention to specific features or aspects of the scans, like certain types of tissue or abnormalities. This focused learning is repeated many times with many different examples, so the model can identify which patterns are clinically important.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The final image that goes to doctors for review is created by combining multiple models working together. Shahandeh compares the approach to Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold, the AI that revolutionized protein structure prediction: Both systems learn to translate one type of biological information into another. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Walsh claims the team at RADiCAIT can mathematically prove that their synthetic or generated PET images are statistically similar to real chemical PET scans. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That’s what our trials show,” he said, “that the same quality of decision has been made when the doctor, radiologist, or oncologist is given a chemical PET or [our AI-generated PET].”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RADiCAIT doesn’t promise to replace the need for PET scans in specific therapeutic settings, like radioligand therapy, which kills cancer cells. But for diagnostic, staging, and monitoring purposes, RADiCAIT’s technology might make PET scans obsolete.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062165" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-09-at-20.32.17.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;RADiCAIT team, from Left: JP Sampson, COO; Sean Walsh, CEO; Sina Shahendeh, CTO; Regent Lee, CMIO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;RADiCAIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Because it’s such a constrained system, there’s not enough supply to meet demand for diagnostics and theragnostics,” Walsh said, referring to a medical approach that combines diagnostic imaging (i.e., PET scans) with targeted therapy to treat diseases (i.e., cancer). “So what we’re looking to do is soak up that demand on the diagnostic side. PET scanners themselves should pick up the slack on the theragnostic side.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RADiCAIT has already begun clinical pilots specifically for lung cancer testing with major health systems like Mass General Brigham and UCSF Health. The startup is now pursuing an FDA clinical trial — a more expensive and involved process that’s driving RADiCAIT’s $5 million seed round. Once that’s approved, the next step will be to do commercial pilots and demonstrate the commercial viability of the product. RADiCAIT also wants to run the same process — clinical pilots, clinical trials, commercial pilots — for colorectal and lymphoma use cases. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shahandeh said RADiCAIT’s approach to using AI to yield valid insights without the burdens of difficult and expensive tests is “broadly applicable.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re exploring extensions across radiology,” Shahandeh added. “Expect to see similar innovations linking domains from materials science to biology, chemistry, and physics wherever nature’s hidden relationships can be learned.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The scans help doctors detect cancer and track its spread, but the process itself is a logistical nightmare for patients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It starts with fasting for four to six hours before coming into the hospital — and good luck to you if you live rurally and your local hospital doesn’t have a PET scanner. When you get to the hospital, you’re injected with radioactive material, after which you must wait an hour while it washes through your body. Next, you enter the PET scanner and have to attempt to lie still for 30 minutes while radiologists acquire the image. After that, you have to keep physically away from the elderly, young people, and pregnant women for up to 12 hours because you’re literally semi-radioactive. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another bottleneck? PET scanners are concentrated in major cities because their radioactive tracers must be produced in nearby cyclotrons — compact nuclear machines — and used within hours, limiting access in rural and regional hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But what if you could use AI to convert CT scans, which are much more accessible and affordable, into PET scans? That’s the pitch of RADiCAIT, an Oxford spinout that came out of stealth this month with $1.7 million in pre-seed financing. The Boston-based startup, which is a Top 20 finalist in Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, has just opened a $5 million raise to advance its clinical trials. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

She was put on dialysis, which meant that she had to go to the hospital four times a week to have her blood filtered by a machine since her own kidneys could no longer function independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Two years later, Maxim’s mother received a kidney transplant. Although the surgery was successful and allowed her to lead a relatively normal life, it wasn’t the end of his family’s struggle with kidney disease. It turned out that Maxim had inherited the disease, Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD), from her.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;About one in seven Americans has Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and about 10% of those CKD cases are due to a genetic condition. Maxim has been obsessed with finding a cure for himself and others ever since he was in high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maxim’s “Aha!” moment occurred in 2021, when Nature Magazine published a study proving that PKD is reversible in mice using CRISPR technology. At the time, he was pursuing his graduate degree in computational biology at Stanford while simultaneously engaging in kidney research under his professor, Vivek Bhalla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Maxim was convinced that gene therapy could reverse PKD, the biggest hurdle was creating a mechanism to deliver the drugs directly to the diseased cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To solve this critical challenge, he founded Nephrogen in 2022, a biotech startup that uses AI and advanced screening to develop a specialized delivery system for safely getting gene-editing medicines into the exact cells in the kidney. Nephrogen is one of the 20 finalists in Startup Battlefield, part of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After three years of development, Maxim claims Nephrogen has succeeded in creating a delivery mechanism that is 100 times more efficient at transporting medicine to the kidney than the “vehicles” currently approved by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The next major step for Nephrogen is to advance its novel delivery mechanism, along with a drug the startup developed, into clinical studies, which Maxim anticipates will begin in 2027. To support this, the company is raising a $4 million seed round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maxim intends to participate in the clinical study himself, given the significant challenges he faces living with PKD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You get a lot of back pain. You have to go to the hospital a lot. You are on this drug that’s supposed to slow the progression, but it doesn’t really do anything. Just makes you pee all the time,” he said, adding that there is always a risk that his disease will progress to require dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This makes Nephrogen’s approach all the more critical, as its success could cure him of PKD entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to hear from Nephrogen firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

There&amp;#x27;s a new king of open source large language models (LLMs), especially when it comes to something enterprises are increasingly valuing: agentic tool use — that is, the ability to go off and use other software capabilities like web search or bespoke applications — without much human guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model is none other than &lt;a href="https://x.com/MiniMax__AI/status/1982674798649160175"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MiniMax-M2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the latest LLM from the Chinese startup of the same name. And in a big win for enterprises globally, the model is available under a permissive, enterprise-friendly MIT License, meaning it is made available freely for developers to take, deploy, retrain, and use how they see fit — even for commercial purposes. It can be found on &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2"&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M2"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.modelscope.cn/models/MiniMax/MiniMax-M2"&gt;ModelScope&lt;/a&gt;, as well as through&lt;a href="https://platform.minimax.io/docs/guides/text-generation"&gt; MiniMax&amp;#x27;s API here.&lt;/a&gt; It supports OpenAI and Anthropic API standards, as well, making it easy for customers of said proprietary AI startups to shift out their models to MiniMax&amp;#x27;s API, if they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1982714153375854998"&gt;independent evaluations by Artificial Analysis&lt;/a&gt;, a third-party generative AI model benchmarking and research organization, M2 now ranks first among all open-weight systems worldwide on the Intelligence Index—a composite measure of reasoning, coding, and task-execution performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In agentic benchmarks that measure how well a model can plan, execute, and use external tools—skills that power coding assistants and autonomous agents—MiniMax’s own reported results, following the Artificial Analysis methodology, show τ²-Bench 77.2, BrowseComp 44.0, and FinSearchComp-global 65.5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These scores place it at or near the level of top proprietary systems like GPT-5 (thinking) and Claude Sonnet 4.5, making &lt;b&gt;MiniMax-M2 the highest-performing open model yet released for real-world agentic and tool-calling tasks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What It Means For Enterprises and the AI Race&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built around an efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, MiniMax-M2 delivers high-end capability for agentic and developer workflows while remaining practical for enterprise deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For technical decision-makers, the release marks an important turning point for open models in business settings. MiniMax-M2 combines frontier-level reasoning with a manageable activation footprint—just 10 billion active parameters out of 230 billion total. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This design enables enterprises to operate advanced reasoning and automation workloads on fewer GPUs, achieving near-state-of-the-art results without the infrastructure demands or licensing costs associated with proprietary frontier systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial Analysis’ data show that MiniMax-M2’s strengths go beyond raw intelligence scores. The model leads or closely trails top proprietary systems such as GPT-5 (thinking) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 across benchmarks for end-to-end coding, reasoning, and agentic tool use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its performance in τ²-Bench, SWE-Bench, and BrowseComp indicates particular advantages for organizations that depend on AI systems capable of planning, executing, and verifying complex workflows—key functions for agentic and developer tools inside enterprise environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As LLM engineer Pierre-Carl Langlais aka &lt;a href="https://x.com/Dorialexander/status/1982761110228127954"&gt;Alexander Doria posted on X&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;MiniMax [is] making a case for mastering the technology end-to-end to get actual agentic automation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compact Design, Scalable Performance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiniMax-M2’s technical architecture is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts model with 230 billion total parameters and 10 billion active per inference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This configuration significantly reduces latency and compute requirements while maintaining broad general intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design allows for responsive agent loops—compile–run–test or browse–retrieve–cite cycles—that execute faster and more predictably than denser models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise technology teams, this means easier scaling, lower cloud costs, and reduced deployment friction.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;According to Artificial Analysis, &lt;b&gt;the model can be served efficiently on as few as four NVIDIA H100 GPUs at FP8 precision&lt;/b&gt;, a setup well within reach for mid-size organizations or departmental AI clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benchmark Leadership Across Agentic and Coding Workflows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiniMax’s benchmark suite highlights strong real-world performance across developer and agent environments. The figure below, released with the model, compares MiniMax-M2 (in red) with several leading proprietary and open models, including GPT-5 (thinking), Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-V3.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiniMax-M2 achieves top or near-top performance in many categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SWE-bench Verified: 69.4 — close to GPT-5’s 74.9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ArtifactsBench: 66.8 — above Claude Sonnet 4.5 and DeepSeek-V3.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;τ²-Bench: 77.2 — approaching GPT-5’s 80.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAIA (text only): 75.7 — surpassing DeepSeek-V3.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;BrowseComp: 44.0 — notably stronger than other open models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FinSearchComp-global: 65.5 — best among tested open-weight systems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results show MiniMax-M2’s capability in executing complex, tool-augmented tasks across multiple languages and environments—skills increasingly relevant for automated support, R&amp;amp;D, and data analysis inside enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strong Showing in Artificial Analysis’ Intelligence Index&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model’s overall intelligence profile is confirmed in the latest &lt;b&gt;Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index v3.0&lt;/b&gt;, which aggregates performance across ten reasoning benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025, IFBench, and τ²-Bench Telecom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MiniMax-M2 scored 61 points&lt;/b&gt;, ranking as the highest open-weight model globally and following closely behind GPT-5 (high) and Grok 4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial Analysis highlighted the model’s balance between technical accuracy, reasoning depth, and applied intelligence across domains. For enterprise users, this consistency indicates a reliable model foundation suitable for integration into software engineering, customer support, or knowledge automation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Designed for Developers and Agentic Systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiniMax engineered M2 for end-to-end developer workflows, enabling multi-file code edits, automated testing, and regression repair directly within integrated development environments or CI/CD pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model also excels in agentic planning—handling tasks that combine web search, command execution, and API calls while maintaining reasoning traceability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These capabilities make MiniMax-M2 especially valuable for enterprises exploring autonomous developer agents, data analysis assistants, or AI-augmented operational tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmarks such as Terminal-Bench and BrowseComp demonstrate the model’s ability to adapt to incomplete data and recover gracefully from intermediate errors, improving reliability in production settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interleaved Thinking and Structured Tool Use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A distinctive aspect of MiniMax-M2 is its interleaved thinking format, which maintains visible reasoning traces between &amp;lt;think&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/think&amp;gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This enables the model to plan and verify steps across multiple exchanges, a critical feature for agentic reasoning. MiniMax advises retaining these segments when passing conversation history to preserve the model’s logic and continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also provides a &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2/blob/main/docs/tool_calling_guide.md"&gt;Tool Calling Guide&lt;/a&gt; on Hugging Face, detailing how developers can connect external tools and APIs via structured XML-style calls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This functionality allows MiniMax-M2 to serve as the reasoning core for larger agent frameworks, executing dynamic tasks such as search, retrieval, and computation through external functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open Source Access and Enterprise Deployment Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises can access the model through the &lt;a href="https://platform.minimax.io/docs/guides/platform-intro"&gt;MiniMax Open Platform API &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://agent.minimax.io/"&gt;MiniMax Agent interface&lt;/a&gt; (a web chat similar to ChatGPT), both currently free for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiniMax recommends SGLang and vLLM for efficient serving, each offering day-one support for the model’s unique interleaved reasoning and tool-calling structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deployment guides and parameter configurations are available through MiniMax’s documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost Efficiency and Token Economics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Artificial Analysis noted, &lt;a href="https://platform.minimax.io/docs/guides/pricing?key=68c79eb793ce7d2b318c5975"&gt;MiniMax’s API pricing&lt;/a&gt;

caveats (for readers):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices are USD per &lt;b&gt;million&lt;/b&gt; tokens and can change; check linked pages for updates and region/endpoint nuances (e.g., Anthropic long-context &amp;gt;200K input, Google Live API variants, cache discounts). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vendors may bill extra for server-side tools (web search, code execution) or offer batch/context-cache discounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the model produces longer, more explicit reasoning traces, its sparse activation and optimized compute design help maintain a favorable cost-performance balance—an advantage for teams deploying interactive agents or high-volume automation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background on MiniMax — an Emerging Chinese Powerhouse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiniMax has quickly become one of the most closely watched names in China’s fast-rising AI sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backed by Alibaba and Tencent, the company moved from relative obscurity to international recognition within a year—first through breakthroughs in AI video generation, then through a series of open-weight large language models (LLMs) aimed squarely at developers and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company first captured &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/minimaxs-ai-video-tool-can-create-star-wars-battles-in-seconds-heres-why-that-matters"&gt;global attention in late 2024 with its AI video generation tool&lt;/a&gt;, “video-01,” which demonstrated the ability to create dynamic, cinematic scenes in seconds. VentureBeat described how the model’s launch sparked widespread interest after online creators began sharing lifelike, AI-generated footage—most memorably, a viral clip of a &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; lightsaber duel that drew millions of views in under two days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Yan Junjie emphasized that the system outperformed leading Western tools in generating human movement and expression, an area where video AIs often struggle. The product, later commercialized through MiniMax’s &lt;i&gt;Hailuo&lt;/i&gt; platform, showcased the startup’s technical confidence and creative reach, helping to establish China as a serious contender in generative video technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early 2025, MiniMax had turned its attention to long-context language modeling, unveiling the &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/minimax-unveils-its-own-open-source-llm-with-industry-leading-4m-token-context"&gt;MiniMax-01 series, including MiniMax-Text-01 and MiniMax-VL-01&lt;/a&gt;. These open-weight models introduced an unprecedented 4-million-token context window, doubling the reach of Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro and dwarfing OpenAI’s GPT-4o by more than twentyfold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company continued its rapid cadence with the &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/minimax-m1-is-a-new-open-source-model-with-1-million-token-context-and-new-hyper-efficient-reinforcement-learning"&gt;MiniMax-M1 release in June 2025&lt;/a&gt;, a model focused on long-context reasoning and reinforcement learning efficiency. M1 extended context capacity to 1 million tokens and introduced a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts design trained using a custom reinforcement-learning algorithm known as CISPO. Remarkably, VentureBeat reported that MiniMax trained M1 at a total cost of about $534,700, roughly one-tenth of DeepSeek’s R1 and far below the multimillion-dollar budgets typical for frontier-scale models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises and technical teams, MiniMax’s trajectory signals the arrival of a new generation of cost-efficient, open-weight models designed for real-world deployment. Its open licensing—ranging from Apache 2.0 to MIT—gives businesses freedom to customize, self-host, and fine-tune without vendor lock-in or compliance restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Features such as structured function calling, long-context retention, and high-efficiency attention architectures directly address the needs of engineering groups managing multi-step reasoning systems and data-intensive pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As MiniMax continues to expand its lineup, the company has emerged as a key global innovator in open-weight AI, combining ambitious research with pragmatic engineering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open-Weight Leadership and Industry Context&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of MiniMax-M2 reinforces the growing leadership of Chinese AI research groups in open-weight model development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following earlier contributions from DeepSeek, Alibaba’s Qwen series, and Moonshot AI, MiniMax’s entry continues the trend toward open, efficient systems designed for real-world use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial Analysis observed that MiniMax-M2 exemplifies a broader shift in focus toward agentic capability and reinforcement-learning refinement, prioritizing controllable reasoning and real utility over raw model size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, this means access to a state-of-the-art open model that can be audited, fine-tuned, and deployed internally with full transparency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pairing strong benchmark performance with open licensing and efficient scaling, MiniMaxAI positions MiniMax-M2 as a practical foundation for intelligent systems that think, act, and assist with traceable logic—making it one of the most enterprise-ready open AI models available today.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;Watch out, DeepSeek and Qwen! There&amp;#x27;s a new king of open source large language models (LLMs), especially when it comes to something enterprises are increasingly valuing: agentic tool use — that is, the ability to go off and use other software capabilities like web search or bespoke applications — without much human guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model is none other than &lt;a href="https://x.com/MiniMax__AI/status/1982674798649160175"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MiniMax-M2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the latest LLM from the Chinese startup of the same name. And in a big win for enterprises globally, the model is available under a permissive, enterprise-friendly MIT License, meaning it is made available freely for developers to take, deploy, retrain, and use how they see fit — even for commercial purposes.

The figure below, released with the model, compares MiniMax-M2 (in red) with several leading proprietary and open models, including GPT-5 (thinking), Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-V3.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiniMax-M2 achieves top or near-top performance in many categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SWE-bench Verified: 69.4 — close to GPT-5’s 74.9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ArtifactsBench: 66.8 — above Claude Sonnet 4.5 and DeepSeek-V3.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;τ²-Bench: 77.2 — approaching GPT-5’s 80.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAIA (text only): 75.7 — surpassing DeepSeek-V3.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;BrowseComp: 44.0 — notably stronger than other open models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FinSearchComp-global: 65.5 — best among tested open-weight systems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results show MiniMax-M2’s capability in executing complex, tool-augmented tasks across multiple languages and environments—skills increasingly relevant for automated support, R&amp;amp;D, and data analysis inside enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strong Showing in Artificial Analysis’ Intelligence Index&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model’s overall intelligence profile is confirmed in the latest &lt;b&gt;Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index v3.0&lt;/b&gt;, which aggregates performance across ten reasoning benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025, IFBench, and τ²-Bench Telecom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MiniMax-M2 scored 61 points&lt;/b&gt;, ranking as the highest open-weight model globally and following closely behind GPT-5 (high) and Grok 4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial Analysis highlighted the model’s balance between technical accuracy, reasoning depth, and applied intelligence across domains. For enterprise users, this consistency indicates a reliable model foundation suitable for integration into software engineering, customer support, or knowledge automation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Designed for Developers and Agentic Systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiniMax engineered M2 for end-to-end developer workflows, enabling multi-file code edits, automated testing, and regression repair directly within integrated development environments or CI/CD pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model also excels in agentic planning—handling tasks that combine web search, command execution, and API calls while maintaining reasoning traceability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These capabilities make MiniMax-M2 especially valuable for enterprises exploring autonomous developer agents, data analysis assistants, or AI-augmented operational tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmarks such as Terminal-Bench and BrowseComp demonstrate the model’s ability to adapt to incomplete data and recover gracefully from intermediate errors, improving reliability in production settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interleaved Thinking and Structured Tool Use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A distinctive aspect of MiniMax-M2 is its interleaved thinking format, which maintains visible reasoning traces between &amp;lt;think&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/think&amp;gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This enables the model to plan and verify steps across multiple exchanges, a critical feature for agentic reasoning. MiniMax advises retaining these segments when passing conversation history to preserve the model’s logic and continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also provides a &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2/blob/main/docs/tool_calling_guide.md"&gt;Tool Calling Guide&lt;/a&gt; on Hugging Face, detailing how developers can connect external tools and APIs via structured XML-style calls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This functionality allows MiniMax-M2 to serve as the reasoning core for larger agent frameworks, executing dynamic tasks such as search, retrieval, and computation through external functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open Source Access and Enterprise Deployment Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises can access the model through the &lt;a href="https://platform.minimax.io/docs/guides/platform-intro"&gt;MiniMax Open Platform API &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://agent.minimax.io/"&gt;MiniMax Agent interface&lt;/a&gt; (a web chat similar to ChatGPT), both currently free for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiniMax recommends SGLang and vLLM for efficient serving, each offering day-one support for the model’s unique interleaved reasoning and tool-calling structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deployment guides and parameter configurations are available through MiniMax’s documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost Efficiency and Token Economics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Artificial Analysis noted, &lt;a href="https://platform.minimax.io/docs/guides/pricing?key=68c79eb793ce7d2b318c5975"&gt;MiniMax’s API pricing&lt;/a&gt; is set at &lt;b&gt;$0.30 per million input tokens&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;$1.20 per million output tokens&lt;/b&gt;, among the most competitive in the open-model ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provider&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Model (doc link)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Input $/1M&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Output $/1M&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiniMax&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.minimax.io/platform/document/pricing?key=68c79eb793ce7d2b318c5975"&gt;MiniMax-M2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;$0.30&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;$1.20&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listed under “Chat Completion v2” for M2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/"&gt;GPT-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;$1.25&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;$10.00&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flagship model pricing on OpenAI’s API pricing page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/"&gt;GPT-5 mini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;$0.25&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;$2.00&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheaper tier for well-defined tasks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing"&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;$3.00&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;$15.00&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s current per-MTok list;

caveats (for readers):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices are USD per &lt;b&gt;million&lt;/b&gt; tokens and can change; check linked pages for updates and region/endpoint nuances (e.g., Anthropic long-context &amp;gt;200K input, Google Live API variants, cache discounts). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vendors may bill extra for server-side tools (web search, code execution) or offer batch/context-cache discounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the model produces longer, more explicit reasoning traces, its sparse activation and optimized compute design help maintain a favorable cost-performance balance—an advantage for teams deploying interactive agents or high-volume automation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background on MiniMax — an Emerging Chinese Powerhouse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiniMax has quickly become one of the most closely watched names in China’s fast-rising AI sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backed by Alibaba and Tencent, the company moved from relative obscurity to international recognition within a year—first through breakthroughs in AI video generation, then through a series of open-weight large language models (LLMs) aimed squarely at developers and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company first captured &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/minimaxs-ai-video-tool-can-create-star-wars-battles-in-seconds-heres-why-that-matters"&gt;global attention in late 2024 with its AI video generation tool&lt;/a&gt;, “video-01,” which demonstrated the ability to create dynamic, cinematic scenes in seconds. VentureBeat described how the model’s launch sparked widespread interest after online creators began sharing lifelike, AI-generated footage—most memorably, a viral clip of a &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; lightsaber duel that drew millions of views in under two days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Yan Junjie emphasized that the system outperformed leading Western tools in generating human movement and expression, an area where video AIs often struggle. The product, later commercialized through MiniMax’s &lt;i&gt;Hailuo&lt;/i&gt; platform, showcased the startup’s technical confidence and creative reach, helping to establish China as a serious contender in generative video technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early 2025, MiniMax had turned its attention to long-context language modeling, unveiling the &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/minimax-unveils-its-own-open-source-llm-with-industry-leading-4m-token-context"&gt;MiniMax-01 series, including MiniMax-Text-01 and MiniMax-VL-01&lt;/a&gt;. These open-weight models introduced an unprecedented 4-million-token context window, doubling the reach of Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro and dwarfing OpenAI’s GPT-4o by more than twentyfold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company continued its rapid cadence with the &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/minimax-m1-is-a-new-open-source-model-with-1-million-token-context-and-new-hyper-efficient-reinforcement-learning"&gt;MiniMax-M1 release in June 2025&lt;/a&gt;, a model focused on long-context reasoning and reinforcement learning efficiency. M1 extended context capacity to 1 million tokens and introduced a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts design trained using a custom reinforcement-learning algorithm known as CISPO. Remarkably, VentureBeat reported that MiniMax trained M1 at a total cost of about $534,700, roughly one-tenth of DeepSeek’s R1 and far below the multimillion-dollar budgets typical for frontier-scale models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises and technical teams, MiniMax’s trajectory signals the arrival of a new generation of cost-efficient, open-weight models designed for real-world deployment. Its open licensing—ranging from Apache 2.0 to MIT—gives businesses freedom to customize, self-host, and fine-tune without vendor lock-in or compliance restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Features such as structured function calling, long-context retention, and high-efficiency attention architectures directly address the needs of engineering groups managing multi-step reasoning systems and data-intensive pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As MiniMax continues to expand its lineup, the company has emerged as a key global innovator in open-weight AI, combining ambitious research with pragmatic engineering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open-Weight Leadership and Industry Context&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of MiniMax-M2 reinforces the growing leadership of Chinese AI research groups in open-weight model development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following earlier contributions from DeepSeek, Alibaba’s Qwen series, and Moonshot AI, MiniMax’s entry continues the trend toward open, efficient systems designed for real-world use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial Analysis observed that MiniMax-M2 exemplifies a broader shift in focus toward agentic capability and reinforcement-learning refinement, prioritizing controllable reasoning and real utility over raw model size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, this means access to a state-of-the-art open model that can be audited, fine-tuned, and deployed internally with full transparency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pairing strong benchmark performance with open licensing and efficient scaling, MiniMaxAI positions MiniMax-M2 as a practical foundation for intelligent systems that think, act, and assist with traceable logic—making it one of the most enterprise-ready open AI models available today.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/minimax-m2-is-the-new-king-of-open-source-llms-especially-for-agentic-tool</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 19:01:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Fitbit’s revamped app, with Gemini-powered health coach, rolls out to Premium users (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/fitbits-revamped-app-with-gemini-powered-health-coach-rolls-out-to-premium-users/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Fitbit’s new Gemini-powered health coach, announced back in August, is becoming available as a public preview to Premium subscribers in the U.S. on Android starting tomorrow. It expands to iOS later this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As the AI race heats up, Google is counting on the Gemini AI assistant to help Fitbit stand out from the crowd. Called “Coach,” this feature is designed to be your all-in-one fitness trainer, sleep coach, and health and wellness advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062686" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ask_Coach.Fitbit.jpeg?w=310" width="310" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the recent Made by Google event, Google showcased Coach’s various capabilities, like how it can create a custom routine based on your goals, preferences, and available equipment. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, if you want to run longer distances without becoming winded, Coach will create a tailored fitness plan with suggestions and achievable targets. While you work out, it’ll adjust your exercise plan in real time based on feedback to keep you on track. And if you happen to get injured later in the week, the AI will modify the plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other capabilities include analyzing your sleep habits and providing insights into how to improve your sleep quality over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the focus will be on Coach, the Fitbit app also features a makeover with a sleek design that’s easier to navigate, organized around four main tabs: Today, Fitness, Sleep, and Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062689" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fitbit_Today_tab.jpeg?w=329" width="329" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google published a demo video on its Made by Google channel on YouTube that explains each tab. The Today tab, for instance, serves as the central hub of the app, highlighting key focus metrics, weekly cardio load data, and any other relevant statistics you may want to glance at quickly. You can manually customize which metrics you want to view at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Fitness tab, meanwhile, houses your workout plans and key metrics, such as your cardio goal and average weekly step count. However, keep in mind that several features are still unavailable, such as nutrition tracking and cycle logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062687" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fitbit_Pixel_9_Pro_UI_Fitness.jpeg?w=329" width="329" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the Sleep tab allows you to track your sleep patterns, with a new feature that provides AI Coach insights to help you enhance your sleep quality. At the bottom of the tab, a Sleep summary aggregates all information from your last night’s sleep, such as whether you experienced prolonged periods of wakefulness during the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062688" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fitbit_Sleep.jpeg?w=329" width="329" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Health tab is dedicated to key metrics, providing quick access to vital signs such as breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation, and resting heart rate, offering a comprehensive overview of your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To check out the Coach preview on Android, you’ll need an active Fitbit Premium subscription and a compatible Fitbit smartwatch, tracker, or Pixel Watch.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Fitbit’s new Gemini-powered health coach, announced back in August, is becoming available as a public preview to Premium subscribers in the U.S. on Android starting tomorrow.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, if you want to run longer distances without becoming winded, Coach will create a tailored fitness plan with suggestions and achievable targets. While you work out, it’ll adjust your exercise plan in real time based on feedback to keep you on track. And if you happen to get injured later in the week, the AI will modify the plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other capabilities include analyzing your sleep habits and providing insights into how to improve your sleep quality over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the focus will be on Coach, the Fitbit app also features a makeover with a sleek design that’s easier to navigate, organized around four main tabs: Today, Fitness, Sleep, and Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062689" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fitbit_Today_tab.jpeg?w=329" width="329" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google published a demo video on its Made by Google channel on YouTube that explains each tab. The Today tab, for instance, serves as the central hub of the app, highlighting key focus metrics, weekly cardio load data, and any other relevant statistics you may want to glance at quickly. You can manually customize which metrics you want to view at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Fitness tab, meanwhile, houses your workout plans and key metrics, such as your cardio goal and average weekly step count. However, keep in mind that several features are still unavailable, such as nutrition tracking and cycle logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062687" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fitbit_Pixel_9_Pro_UI_Fitness.jpeg?w=329" width="329" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the Sleep tab allows you to track your sleep patterns, with a new feature that provides AI Coach insights to help you enhance your sleep quality. At the bottom of the tab, a Sleep summary aggregates all information from your last night’s sleep, such as whether you experienced prolonged periods of wakefulness during the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062688" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fitbit_Sleep.jpeg?w=329" width="329" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Health tab is dedicated to key metrics, providing quick access to vital signs such as breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation, and resting heart rate, offering a comprehensive overview of your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To check out the Coach preview on Android, you’ll need an active Fitbit Premium subscription and a compatible Fitbit smartwatch, tracker, or Pixel Watch.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/fitbits-revamped-app-with-gemini-powered-health-coach-rolls-out-to-premium-users/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 19:11:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] OpenAI says over a million people talk to ChatGPT about suicide weekly (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-says-over-a-million-people-talk-to-chatgpt-about-suicide-weekly/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2194585161.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI released new data on Monday illustrating how many of ChatGPT’s users are struggling with mental health issues and talking to the AI chatbot about it. The company says that 0.15% of ChatGPT’s active users in a given week have “conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” Given that ChatGPT has more than 800 million weekly active users, that translates to more than a million people a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says a similar percentage of users show “heightened levels of emotional attachment to ChatGPT,” and that hundreds of thousands of people show signs of psychosis or mania in their weekly conversations with the AI chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says these types of conversations in ChatGPT are “extremely rare,” and thus difficult to measure. That said, the company estimates these issues affect hundreds of thousands of people every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI shared the information as part of a broader announcement about its recent efforts to improve how models respond to users with mental health issues. The company claims its latest work on ChatGPT involved consulting with more than 170 mental health experts. OpenAI says these clinicians observed that the latest version of ChatGPT “responds more appropriately and consistently than earlier versions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In recent months, several stories have shed light on how AI chatbots can adversely affect users struggling with mental health challenges. Researchers have previously found that AI chatbots can lead some users down delusional rabbit holes, largely by reinforcing dangerous beliefs through sycophantic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Addressing mental health concerns in ChatGPT is quickly becoming an existential issue for OpenAI. The company is currently being sued by the parents of a 16-year-old boy who confided his suicidal thoughts to ChatGPT in the weeks leading up to his suicide. State attorneys general from California and Delaware — which could block the company’s planned restructuring — have also warned OpenAI that it needs to protect young people who use their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed in a post on X that the company has “been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues” in ChatGPT, though he did not provide specifics. The data shared on Monday appears to be evidence for that claim, though it raises broader issues about how widespread the problem is. Nevertheless, Altman said OpenAI would be relaxing some restrictions, even allowing adult users to start having erotic conversations with the AI chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the Monday announcement, OpenAI claims the recently updated version of GPT-5 responds with “desirable responses” to mental health issues roughly 65% more than the previous version. On an evaluation testing AI responses around suicidal conversations, OpenAI says its new GPT-5 model is 91% compliant with the company’s desired behaviors, compared to 77% for the previous GPT‑5 model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also says its latest version of GPT-5 also holds up to OpenAI’s safeguards better in long conversations. OpenAI has previously flagged that its safeguards were less effective in long conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On top of these efforts, OpenAI says it’s adding new evaluations to measure some of the most serious mental health challenges facing ChatGPT users. The company says its baseline safety testing for AI models will now include benchmarks for emotional reliance and non-suicidal mental health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has also recently rolled out more controls for parents of children who use ChatGPT. The company says it’s building an age prediction system to automatically detect children using ChatGPT, and impose a stricter set of safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, it’s unclear how persistent the mental health challenges around ChatGPT will be. While GPT-5 seems to be an improvement over previous AI models in terms of safety, there still seems to be a slice of ChatGPT’s responses that OpenAI deems “undesirable.” OpenAI also still makes its older and less-safe AI models, including GPT-4o, available for millions of its paying subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Since last year’s disastrous rollout of Google’s AI Overviews, the world at large has been aware of how AI-powered search results can differ wildly from the traditional list of links search engines have generated for decades. Now, new research helps quantify that difference, showing that AI search engines tend to cite less popular websites and ones that wouldn’t even appear in the Top 100 links listed in an “organic” Google search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pre-print paper “Characterizing Web Search in The Age of Generative AI,” researchers from Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, and the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems compared traditional link results from Google’s search engine to its AI Overviews and Gemini-2.5-Flash. The researchers also looked at GPT-4o’s web search mode and the separate “GPT-4o with Search Tool,” which resorts to searching the web only when the LLM decides it needs information found outside its own pre-trained data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew test queries from a number of sources, including specific questions submitted to ChatGPT in the WildChat dataset, general political topics listed on AllSides, and products included in the 100 most-searched Amazon products list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the sources cited in results from the generative search tools tended to be from sites that were less popular than those that appeared in the top 10 of a traditional search, as measured by the domain-tracker Tranco. Sources cited by the AI engines were more likely than those linked in traditional Google searches to fall outside both the top 1,000 and top 1,000,000 domains tracked by Tranco. Gemini search in particular showed a tendency to cite unpopular domains, with the median source falling outside Tranco’s top 1,000 across all results.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      A majority of the cited AI Overview sources don’t appear in the top 10 Google link results for the same query.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sources cited by the AI-powered search engines also tended to be ones that wouldn’t appear anywhere near the top results for the same organic Google search. Fifty-three percent of the sources cited by Google’s AI Overviews, for instance, didn’t appear in the top 10 Google links for the same query, and 40 percent of those sources didn’t even fall in the top 100 Google links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OK, but which one is better?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These differences don’t necessarily mean the AI-generated results are “worse,” of course. The researchers found that GPT-based searches were more likely to cite sources like corporate entities and encyclopedias for their information, for instance, while almost never citing social media websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An LLM-based analysis tool found that AI-powered search results also tended to cover a similar number of identifiable “concepts” as the traditional top 10 links, suggesting a similar level of detail, diversity, and novelty in the results. At the same time, the researchers found that “generative engines tend to compress information, sometimes omitting secondary or ambiguous aspects that traditional search retains.” That was especially true for more ambiguous search terms (such as names shared by different people), for which “organic search results provide better coverage,” the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI search engines also arguably have an advantage in being able to weave pre-trained “internal knowledge” in with data culled from cited websites. That was especially true for GPT-4o with Search Tool, which often didn’t cite any web sources and simply provided a direct response based on its training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this reliance on pre-trained data can become a limitation when searching for timely information. For search terms pulled from Google’s list of Trending Queries for September 15, the researchers found GPT-4o with Search Tool often responded with messages along the lines of “could you please provide more information” rather than actually searching the web for up-to-date information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the researchers didn’t determine whether AI-based search engines were overall “better” or “worse” than traditional search engine links, they did urge future research on “new evaluation methods that jointly consider source diversity, conceptual coverage, and synthesis behavior in generative search systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Since last year’s disastrous rollout of Google’s AI Overviews, the world at large has been aware of how AI-powered search results can differ wildly from the traditional list of links search engines have generated for decades. Now, new research helps quantify that difference, showing that AI search engines tend to cite less popular websites and ones that wouldn’t even appear in the Top 100 links listed in an “organic” Google search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pre-print paper “Characterizing Web Search in The Age of Generative AI,” researchers from Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, and the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems compared traditional link results from Google’s search engine to its AI Overviews and Gemini-2.5-Flash. The researchers also looked at GPT-4o’s web search mode and the separate “GPT-4o with Search Tool,” which resorts to searching the web only when the LLM decides it needs information found outside its own pre-trained data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew test queries from a number of sources, including specific questions submitted to ChatGPT in the WildChat dataset, general political topics listed on AllSides, and products included in the 100 most-searched Amazon products list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the sources cited in results from the generative search tools tended to be from sites that were less popular than those that appeared in the top 10 of a traditional search, as measured by the domain-tracker Tranco. Sources cited by the AI engines were more likely than those linked in traditional Google searches to fall outside both the top 1,000 and top 1,000,000 domains tracked by Tranco. Gemini search in particular showed a tendency to cite unpopular domains, with the median source falling outside Tranco’s top 1,000 across all results.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      A majority of the cited AI Overview sources don’t appear in the top 10 Google link results for the same query.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sources cited by the AI-powered search engines also tended to be ones that wouldn’t appear anywhere near the top results for the same organic Google search. Fifty-three percent of the sources cited by Google’s AI Overviews, for instance, didn’t appear in the top 10 Google links for the same query, and 40 percent of those sources didn’t even fall in the top 100 Google links.&lt;/p&gt;

But each individual movement or task requires its own specific training process, which makes it hard for robots to adapt in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mbodi wants to make training robots easier and quicker with the help of AI agents. The company will be showcasing this tech as one of the Top 20 Startup Battlefield finalists at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;New York-based Mbodi built a cloud-to-edge system, a hybrid computing system using both cloud and local compute, that is designed to integrate into existing robotic tech stacks. The software relies on a multitude of AI agents that communicate with each other to gather the needed information to help a robot learn a task faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once deployed, Mbodi will collect data and learn from its real-world use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Xavier Chi, co-founder of Mbodi, told TechCrunch that users prompt the software using natural language, and Mbodi breaks down the request into smaller subtasks. Mbodi’s cluster of agents essentially divides and conquers the task to gather the needed information to train the robot on the prompt quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The tricky thing with the physical world, it’s infinite possibility,” Chi said. “Every time you can invent something completely new, you haven’t had any data, that is a problem in the physical world. We always need to have a system where you can orchestrate different models or have anyone correct a robot and tell it to do certain things certain ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chi said he and co-founder Sebastian Peralta got the idea for the company while working as engineers at Google. While they weren’t working on robotics, they both came to the realization that the advancements in AI were heading to the physical world and despite a rise in physical AI, there still wasn’t a great way to quickly train robots.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Many companies, like Skild AI and FieldAI, are looking to help make training robots faster by building large world AI models with enough real-world data to make it easier for them to adapt to new environments. Chi said that philosophy just doesn’t work with how much the world constantly changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mbodi launched in 2024 with a focus on picking and packaging. The company won an ABB Robotics AI startup competition last year, which landed them a partnership with the Swiss robotics organization that was acquired by SoftBank for $5.4 billion in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now the company is working with a Fortune 100 company in the consumer and product goods space on a proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“For the CPG customer, they have a lot of people, they pack different products of their brand into a tray or a shelf thing, the problem is it changes every day,” Chi said. “Because of that, it is impossible to put robots there. To reprogram these robots, it’s just not possible, there is still a lot of humans doing that work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mbodi hopes to start deploying its software more in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We want to build something that works, that can actually be deployed,” Chi said. “We aren’t a research lab; we don’t want to be a research lab in that regard. We want to put something in production that works reliably.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to hear from Mbodi firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Mbodi’s cluster of agents essentially divides and conquers the task to gather the needed information to train the robot on the prompt quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The tricky thing with the physical world, it’s infinite possibility,” Chi said. “Every time you can invent something completely new, you haven’t had any data, that is a problem in the physical world. We always need to have a system where you can orchestrate different models or have anyone correct a robot and tell it to do certain things certain ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chi said he and co-founder Sebastian Peralta got the idea for the company while working as engineers at Google. While they weren’t working on robotics, they both came to the realization that the advancements in AI were heading to the physical world and despite a rise in physical AI, there still wasn’t a great way to quickly train robots.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Many companies, like Skild AI and FieldAI, are looking to help make training robots faster by building large world AI models with enough real-world data to make it easier for them to adapt to new environments. Chi said that philosophy just doesn’t work with how much the world constantly changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mbodi launched in 2024 with a focus on picking and packaging. The company won an ABB Robotics AI startup competition last year, which landed them a partnership with the Swiss robotics organization that was acquired by SoftBank for $5.4 billion in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now the company is working with a Fortune 100 company in the consumer and product goods space on a proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“For the CPG customer, they have a lot of people, they pack different products of their brand into a tray or a shelf thing, the problem is it changes every day,” Chi said. “Because of that, it is impossible to put robots there. To reprogram these robots, it’s just not possible, there is still a lot of humans doing that work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mbodi hopes to start deploying its software more in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We want to build something that works, that can actually be deployed,” Chi said. “We aren’t a research lab; we don’t want to be a research lab in that regard. We want to put something in production that works reliably.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to hear from Mbodi firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Do I get better sleep after exercising?” sounds like a simple question, but answering it like a proactive, personalized and adaptive coach required several technical innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need the coach to understand and do numerical reasoning on physiological time series data such as sleep and activity, using capabilities similar to those showcased by PH-LLM. For questions like this, the coach verifies recent data availability, chooses the right metrics, contrasts relevant days, contextualizes results against personal baselines and population-level statistics, incorporates prior interactions with the coach, and finally uses the analysis to provide tailored answers and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we utilize a multi-agent framework that coordinates expert sub-agents to provide clear, consistent and holistic support, such as (1) a conversational agent for multi-turn conversations, intent understanding, agent orchestration, context gathering and response generation; (2) a data science agent that iteratively uses tools to fetch, analyze, and summarize relevant data (e.g., sleep and workout data), leveraging code-generation capabilities as needed; and (3) a domain expert, such as a fitness expert that analyzes user data to generate personalized fitness plans and adapt them as progress and context change.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Speaking on stage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Monday, Yuan discussed his videoconferencing product’s embrace of AI, which includes a “digital twin” feature where an AI avatar can speak for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yuan began using his AI avatar in an earnings call with investors this year, demonstrating the technology’s potential and ability to push the “boundaries of communication,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At Disrupt, the exec emphasized spending a lot of time talking about AI and the right products to bring to market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When asked about what he’s investing in, he responded, “AI, AI, and AI.” The technology is the subject of multi-hour strategy meetings, as Zoom believes in its potential to transform work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yuan also suggested there were many more use cases for AI companions, beyond just video conferencing stand-ins. He offered a potential future scenario where two business execs were negotiating a contract over Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead of being on a call for a long time, they could send their digital twins to work together on the plan first, Yuan said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He also spoke of how AI could assist with email, checking your messages for you, and help you figure out what was important and in need of a response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, Yuan believes that AI could enhance Zoom’s broader suite of solutions, which includes things like an online whiteboard and collaborative docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Today, I need a manually focus on all those products to get work done. Eventually, AI will help,” Yuan said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“By doing that, we do not need to work five days a week anymore, right?… Five years out, three days or four days [a week]. That’s a goal,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1137874452.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Zoom founder and CEO Eric Yuan believes that AI assistants will finally allow us to shorten our workweek.
