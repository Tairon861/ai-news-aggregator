          &lt;p&gt;French law enforcement authorities today raided X’s Paris office and summoned Elon Musk for questioning as part of an investigation into illegal content. The Paris public prosecutor’s office said the yearlong probe was recently expanded because the Grok chatbot was disseminating Holocaust-denial claims and sexually explicit deepfakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europol, which is assisting French authorities, said today the “investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offenses linked to the functioning and use of the platform, including the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity.” Europol’s cybercrime center provided “an analyst on the ground in Paris to assist national authorities.” The French Gendarmerie’s cybercrime unit is also aiding the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French authorities want to question Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino, who quit last year amid a controversy over Grok’s praise of Hitler. Prosecutors summoned Musk and Yaccarino for interviews in April 2026, though the interviews are being described as voluntary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office of Paris public prosecutor Laure Beccuau said today that the potential crimes&amp;nbsp;being investigated include complicity in possession and distribution of pornographic images of minors; infringement of personal image rights via sexual deepfakes; denial of crimes against humanity; fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system; falsification of the operation of an automated data processing system; and operation of an illegal online platform by an organized group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We contacted X today and will update this article if it provides any comment. The company criticized the investigation at an earlier stage, alleging in July 2025 that France was conducting “a politically motivated criminal investigation into X” that “threatens our users’ rights to privacy and free speech.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;UK probe moves ahead with “urgency”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said in July 2025 that it was “in the dark” over what specific allegations it faced related to manipulation of the X algorithm and fraudulent data extraction. X said it would not comply with France’s request for access to its recommendation algorithm and real-time data about all user posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris prosecutor’s office today said the investigation is taking a “constructive approach” with the goal of ensuring that X complies with French laws “insofar as it operates on national territory.” In addition to Musk and Yaccarino, the prosecutor’s office is seeking interviews with X employees about the allegations and potential compliance measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, UK communications regulator Ofcom today provided an update on its investigation into Grok’s generation of sexual deepfakes of real people, including children. Ofcom is “gathering and analyzing evidence to determine whether X has broken the law” and is “progressing the investigation as a matter of urgency,” it said. Ofcom is not currently investigating xAI, the Musk company that develops Grok, but said it “continue[s] to demand answers from xAI about the risks it poses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which regulates data protection, said today it opened a formal investigation into X regarding the “processing of personal data in relation to the Grok artificial intelligence system and its potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have taken this step following reports that Grok has been used to generate non‑consensual sexual imagery of individuals, including children,” the ICO said. “The reported creation and circulation of such content raises serious concerns under UK data protection law and presents a risk of significant potential harm to the public.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the Cisco AI Summit on Tuesday, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced that the company will start producing graphics processing units (GPUs). These are more specialized processors, compared to the CPUs Intel traditionally produces, and are used for gaming and tasks like training artificial intelligence models.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch reached out to Intel for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The project will be overseen by Kevork Kechichian, the executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s data center group, according to reporting from Reuters. Kechichian was hired in September among a slew of new engineer-focused hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel also hired Eric Demers for the effort in January. Demers was previously at Qualcomm for more than 13 years, most recently serving as a senior vice president of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This initiative seems to be in relatively early stages as Tan said the company plans to develop its strategy around customer demands and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Nvidia didn’t invent the GPU, that specific kind of chip has played a large role in its success. Its GPUs for AI systems are so advanced and popular, the chipmaker currently holds a commanding market lead.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s interesting to see Intel expand into this area now as Tan said the company would be consolidating and focusing on its core businesses when he took the helm as CEO last March. While GPUs are still semiconductors, of course, this is still a notable expansion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2228936694.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As Intel continues to try to turn itself around, its CEO promised that the company will start producing a new type of chip, one that has been made very popular by rival Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Nvidia didn’t invent the GPU, that specific kind of chip has played a large role in its success. Its GPUs for AI systems are so advanced and popular, the chipmaker currently holds a commanding market lead.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s interesting to see Intel expand into this area now as Tan said the company would be consolidating and focusing on its core businesses when he took the helm as CEO last March. While GPUs are still semiconductors, of course, this is still a notable expansion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/intel-will-start-making-gpus-a-market-dominated-by-nvidia/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 21:01:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Counter intelligence (MIT News - Artificial intelligence)</title><link>https://news.mit.edu/2026/counter-intelligence-kitchen-cosmo-0203</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202601/mit-architecture-kitchen-cosmo.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="news-article--content--body--inner"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;How can artificial intelligence step out of a screen and become something we can physically touch and interact with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That question formed the foundation of class 4.043/4.044 (Interaction Intelligence), an MIT course focused on designing a new category of AI-driven interactive objects. Known as large language objects (LLOs), these physical interfaces extend large language models into the real world. Their behaviors can be deliberately generated for specific people or applications, and their interactions can evolve from simple to increasingly sophisticated — providing meaningful support for both novice and expert users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I came to the realization&amp;nbsp;that, while powerful, these new forms of intelligence&amp;nbsp;still remain largely ignorant of the world outside of language,” says Marcelo Coelho, associate professor of the practice in the MIT Department of Architecture, who has been teaching the design studio for several years and directs the&amp;nbsp;Design Intelligence Lab. “They lack real-time, contextual understanding of our physical surroundings, bodily experiences, and social relationships to be truly intelligent. In contrast, LLOs are physically situated and interact in real time with their physical environment. The course is an attempt to both address this gap and develop a new kind of design discipline for the age of AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the assignment to design an interactive device that they would want in their lives,&amp;nbsp;students Jacob Payne and Ayah Mahmoud focused on the kitchen. While they each enjoy cooking and baking, their design inspiration came from the first home computer: the&amp;nbsp;Honeywell 316 Kitchen Computer, marketed by Neiman Marcus in 1969. Priced at $10,000, there is no record of one ever being sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was an ambitious but impractical early attempt at a home kitchen computer,” says Payne, an architecture graduate student. “It made an intriguing historical reference for the project.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As somebody who likes learning to cook — especially now, in college as an undergrad — the thought of designing something that makes cooking easy for those who might not have a cooking background and just wants a nice meal that satisfies their cravings was a great starting point for me,” says&amp;nbsp;Mahmoud, a senior design major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thought about the leftover ingredients you have in the refrigerator or pantry, and how AI could help you find new creative uses for things that you may otherwise throw away,” says Payne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative cuisine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students designed their device — named&amp;nbsp;Kitchen Cosmo — with instructions to function as a “recipe generator.” One challenge was prompting the LLM to consistently acknowledge real-world cooking parameters, such as heating, timing, or temperature. One issue they worked out was having the LLM recognize flavor profiles and spices accurate to regional and cultural dishes around the world to support a wider range of cuisines. Troubleshooting included taste-testing recipes Kitchen Cosmo generated. Not every early recipe produced a winning dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were lots of small things that AI wasn't great at conceptually understanding,” says Mahmoud. “An LLM needs to fundamentally understand human taste to make a great meal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fine-tuned their device to allow for the myriad ways people approach preparing a meal. Is this breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a snack? How advanced of a cook are you? How much meal prep time do you have? How many servings will you make? Dietary preferences were also programmed, as well as the type of mood or vibe you want to achieve. Are you feeling nostalgic, or are you in a celebratory mood? There’s a dial for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These selections were the focal point of the device because we were curious to see how the LLM would interpret subjective adjectives as inputs and use them to transform the type of recipe outputs we would get,” says Payne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most AI interactions that tend to be invisible, Payne and Mahmoud wanted their device to be more of a “partner” in the kitchen. The tactile interface was intentionally designed to structure the interaction, giving users a physical control over how the AI responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While I’ve worked with electronics and hardware before, this project pushed me to integrate the components with a level of precision and refinement that felt much closer to a product-ready device,” says Payne of the course work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retro and red&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After their electronic work was completed, the students designed a series of models using cardboard until settling on the final look, which Payne describes as “retro.” The body was designed in a 3D modeling software and printed. In a nod to the original Honeywell computer, they painted it red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thin, rectangular device about 18 inches in height, Kitchen Cosmo has a webcam that hinges open to scan ingredients set on a counter. It translates these into a recipe that takes into consideration general spices and condiments common in most households. An integrated thermal printer delivers a printed recipe that is torn off. Recipes can be stored in a plastic receptacle on its base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kitchen Cosmo made a modest splash in design magazines, both students have ideas where they will take future iterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payne would like to see it “take advantage of a lot of the data we have in the kitchen and use AI as a mediator, offering tips for how to improve on what you’re cooking at that moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahmoud is looking at how to optimize Kitchen Cosmo for her thesis. Classmates have given feedback to upgrade its abilities. One suggestion is to provide multi-person instructions that give several people tasks needed to complete a recipe. Another idea is to create a “learning mode” in which a kitchen tool — for example, a paring knife — is set in front of Kitchen Cosmo, and it delivers instructions on how to use the tool. Mahmoud has been researching food science history as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d like to get a better handle on how to train AI to fully understand food so it can tailor recipes to a user’s liking,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having begun her MIT education as a geologist, Mahmoud’s pivot to design has been a revelation, she says. Each design class has been inspiring. Coelho’s course was her first class to include designing with AI.

I see myself doing design long-term, which is something I didn’t think I would have said previously about technology.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Artificial intelligence will be infrastructure,” like water, electricity and the internet, Huang told the crowd, playfully referring to the engineering-heavy audience as “Solid Workers,” a nod to Dassault Systèmes’ SolidWorks platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement continues a collaboration spanning more than a quarter-century between NVIDIA and Dassault Systèmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-89590" height="511" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/dassault-jhh-email-1280x680-30-960x511.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the largest collaboration our two companies have ever had in over a quarter century,” Huang said. “We’re going to fuse these technologies so engineers can work at a scale that’s 100 times, 1,000 times — and eventually a million times greater than before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new partnership brings NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI libraries together with Dassault Systèmes’ Virtual Twin platforms to move more engineering work into real-time digital workflows, powered by AI companions that help teams explore, validate, prototype and iterate faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang framed the shift as a reinvention of the computing stack: moving from hand-specified, structured digital designs to systems that can generate, simulate and optimize in software — at industrial scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Digital Models to Industry World Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual twins are not applications, “they are knowledge factories,” Daloz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership aims to establish industry world models — science-validated AI systems grounded in physics that can serve as mission-critical platforms across biology, materials science, engineering and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Daloz’s framing, the value moves upstream: virtual twins become the place where knowledge is created, tested and trusted — before anything is built in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dassault Systèmes, whose 3DEXPERIENCE platform serves more than 45 million users and 400,000 customers globally, has long been a leader in virtual twin technology — digital replicas that let engineers simulate products and processes before building them physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration brings together accelerated computing, AI and digital twin technologies so engineers can design geometry as well as behavior — and explore radically larger design spaces earlier in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the companies outlined how this shared architecture will show up across science, engineering and manufacturing workflows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advancing Biology and Materials Research​: The NVIDIA BioNeMo platform and BIOVIA science-validated world models accelerate the discovery of new molecules and next-generation materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI-Driven Design and Engineering: SIMULIA AI-based Virtual Twin Physics Behavior using NVIDIA CUDA-X and AI physics libraries empowers designers and engineers to accurately and instantly predict outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual Twins for Every Factory: NVIDIA Omniverse physical AI libraries integrated with the DELMIA Virtual Twin enable autonomous, software-defined production systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual Companions Supercharge Dassault Systèmes’ Users: The 3DEXPERIENCE agentic platform, combining NVIDIA AI technologies and NVIDIA Nemotron open models with Dassault Systèmes’ Industry World Models, powers Virtual Companions to tap into deep industrial context, delivering trusted, actionable intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang said that in domains like biology and materials, the frontier is learning the underlying “language” of complex systems and then generating new options that can be evaluated and validated in simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Designing and Operating the Factory in Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central theme of the discussion was how factories themselves are changing — from static physical assets to living systems that are designed, simulated and operated as virtual twins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the partnership, Dassault Systèmes is deploying NVIDIA-powered AI factories on three continents through its OUTSCALE sovereign cloud, enabling customers to run AI workloads while maintaining data residency and security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both executives emphasized that the goal isn’t to replace engineers — it’s to amplify them. As AI agent companions take on more exploratory and repetitive tasks, designers and engineers gain leverage and creativity, not redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI Companions That Expand Human Creativity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every designer will have a “team of companions,” Huang said — a shift he described as fundamentally positive for engineers, software platforms and the broader ecosystem built on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 10s of millions of engineers who use Dassault Systèmes tools to design everything from aircraft to consumer packaged goods, the shift isn’t about replacing human creativity — it’s about expanding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Success is not about automation,” Daloz said. “[Engineers] don’t want to automate the past — they want to invent the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Daloz framed the partnership as about more than performance gains — it’s an effort to open new possibilities, help companies eliminate bad choices before they become expensive mistakes and create entirely new categories of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Virtual twins and the 3D universes are not applications,” Daloz said. “They are knowledge factories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fireside conversation between Huang and Daloz was broadcast live from 3DEXPERIENCE World.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;In September 2025, Nvidia and OpenAI announced a letter of intent for Nvidia to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s AI infrastructure. At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details “in the coming weeks.” Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia’s CEO now says the $100 billion figure was “never a commitment,” and Reuters reports that OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in OpenAI’s Codex, an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex’s performance limitations to Nvidia’s GPU-based hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Reuters story published and Nvidia’s stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: “We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don’t get where all this insanity is coming from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happened to the $100 billion?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The September announcement described a wildly ambitious plan: 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI, requiring power output equal to roughly 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC at the time that the project would match Nvidia’s total GPU shipments for the year. “This is a giant project,” Huang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the deal was always a letter of intent, not a binding contract. And in recent weeks, Huang has been walking back the number. On Saturday, he told reporters in Taiwan that the $100 billion was “never a commitment.” He said OpenAI had invited Nvidia to invest “up to” that amount and that Nvidia would “invest one step at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,” Huang said. “Sam is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved. We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we’ve ever made.” But when asked if it would be $100 billion, Huang replied, “No, no, nothing like that.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;A Wall Street Journal report on Friday said Nvidia insiders had expressed doubts about the transaction and that Huang had privately criticized what he described as a lack of discipline in OpenAI’s business approach. The Journal also reported that Huang had expressed concern about the competition OpenAI faces from Google and Anthropic. Huang called those claims “nonsense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia shares fell about 1.1 percent on Monday following the reports. Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC that the back-and-forth was unusual. “One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn’t a strong ‘It will be $100 billion.’ It was, ‘It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.’ And so I do think there are some question marks there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, noted the circular nature of such investments to CNBC. “Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,” Talkington said. “I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech critic Ed Zitron has been critical of Nvidia’s circular investments for some time, which touch dozens of tech companies, including major players and startups. They are also all Nvidia customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NVIDIA seeds companies and gives them the guaranteed contracts necessary to raise debt to buy GPUs from NVIDIA,” Zitron wrote on Bluesky last September, “Even though these companies are horribly unprofitable and will eventually die from a lack of any real demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chips from other places&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of sourcing GPUs from Nvidia, OpenAI has reportedly discussed working with startups Cerebras and Groq, both of which build chips designed to reduce inference latency. But in December, Nvidia struck a $20 billion licensing deal with Groq, which Reuters sources say ended OpenAI’s talks with Groq. Nvidia hired Groq’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with other senior leaders as part of the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, OpenAI announced a $10 billion deal with Cerebras instead, adding 750 megawatts of computing capacity for faster inference through 2028. Sachin Katti, who joined OpenAI from Intel in November to lead compute infrastructure, said the partnership adds “a dedicated low-latency inference solution” to OpenAI’s platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But OpenAI has clearly been hedging its bets. Beyond the Cerebras deal, the company struck an agreement with AMD in October for six gigawatts of GPUs and announced plans with Broadcom to develop a custom AI chip to wean itself off of Nvidia dependence. When those chips will be ready, however, is currently unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

But in December, Nvidia struck a $20 billion licensing deal with Groq, which Reuters sources say ended OpenAI’s talks with Groq. Nvidia hired Groq’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with other senior leaders as part of the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, OpenAI announced a $10 billion deal with Cerebras instead, adding 750 megawatts of computing capacity for faster inference through 2028. Sachin Katti, who joined OpenAI from Intel in November to lead compute infrastructure, said the partnership adds “a dedicated low-latency inference solution” to OpenAI’s platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But OpenAI has clearly been hedging its bets. Beyond the Cerebras deal, the company struck an agreement with AMD in October for six gigawatts of GPUs and announced plans with Broadcom to develop a custom AI chip to wean itself off of Nvidia dependence. When those chips will be ready, however, is currently unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
