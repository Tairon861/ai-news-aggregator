&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Prior to Sora’s launch this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI had been telling Hollywood studios and agencies that they needed to explicitly opt out if they didn’t want their IP to be included in Sora-generated videos.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite being invite-only, the app quickly climbed to the top of the App Store charts. Sora’s most distinctive feature may be its “cameos,” where users can upload their biometric data to see their digital likeness featured in AI-generated videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, users also seem to delight in flouting copyright laws by creating videos with popular, studio-owned characters. In some cases, those characters might even criticize the company’s approach to copyright, for example in videos where Pikachu and SpongeBob interact with deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a blog post published Friday, Altman said the company is already planning two changes to Sora, first by giving copyright holders “more granular control over generation of characters, similar to the opt-in model for likeness but with additional controls.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The key word here appears to be “opt-in,” suggesting that OpenAI will stop users from creating videos with copyrighted characters unless studios and others rightsholders have actually given Sora permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction’ and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all),” Altman said.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even with this new approach, Altman acknowledged there are likely to be “some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The second change he mentioned is some unspecified form of video monetization. The company previously said its only plan for monetization was to charge users to create extra videos during periods of high demand, and Altman’s blog post seems to elaborate on that idea by acknowledging “we are going to have to somehow make money for video generation.” He also suggesting the revenue could be shared with rightsholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our hope is that the new kind of engagement is even more valuable than the revenue share, but of course we … want both to be valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-app-GettyImages2238161095.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI may be reversing course on how it approaches copyright and intellectual property in its new video app Sora.&lt;/p&gt;

In some countries, like India or Chile, it can be more than 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Mario Bustamante, who lives in Chile, the problem hits close to home. “Lack of water is a big issue here,” he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bustamante is betting that AI can help slash water use in farms across the world. His startup, Instacrops, was originally founded to deploy internet-of-things (IoT) sensors on farms to warn farmers about damaging frost conditions, but as the hardware became commoditized, the company pivoted to software and water use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, Instacrops is helping 260 farms cut their water use up to 30% while also increasing crop yields by as much as 20%. The company is part of Startup Battlefield, and it will be presenting at TechCrunch Disrupt later this month in San Francisco.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The switch from hardware to AI turned the company on its head, allowing it to operate with fewer staff and while processing more data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are processing — more or less — 15 million data points per hour. Almost 10 years ago, that was the amount for a year,” Bustamante said. “We’re reducing cost, team members, and generating more impact with less.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instacrops can install new IoT sensors or connect to a farm’s existing network and collect data from them to advise farmers when to irrigate different areas. The startup’s LLM models ingest more than 80 parameters, including soil moisture, humidity, temperature, pressure, crop yield, and NDVI, a plant productivity metric derived from satellite imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those advisories are sent to farmers’ mobile phones. Instacrops offers a chatbot app, but it also integrates with WhatsApp. “I think in the next year, we will be 100% WhatsApp because it’s a universal tool for any farmer,” Bustamante said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On farms that are more technologically advanced, Instacrops can control irrigation systems directly, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instacrops is focused on high-value crops in Latin America, including apples, avocados, blueberries, almonds, and cherries. Farmers pay an annual fee per hectare of farmland to gain access to the startup’s irrigation insights.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup was a part of the Y Combinator summer 2021 batch, and it has received investments from SVG Ventures and Genesis Ventures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to learn more about Instacrops, and dozens of other startups, live and in person, don’t miss TechCrunch Disrupt, taking place October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PitchBook reports that VCs have poured $192.7 billion into the industry so far this year, out of a total $366.8 billion, according to Bloomberg. In the most recent quarter, AI accounted for 62.7% of the money invested by U.S. VCs, and for 53.2% of money invested by global firms.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most of that money is going to marquee names like Anthropic, which announced a $13 billion Series F in September. Meanwhile, the number of startups and venture funds successfully raising money are at their lowest levels in years — PitchBook says that 823 funds have been raised globally so far in 2025, compared to 4,430 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PitchBook’s director of research Kyle Sanford told Bloomberg that the market is becoming “bifurcated,” where “you’re in AI, or you’re not” and “you’re a big firm, or you’re not.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-941290532.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;New PitchBook data illustrates how dramatically AI is dominating startup investment, with 2025 on-track to become the first year when AI accounts for more than half of all VC money invested.&lt;/p&gt;
