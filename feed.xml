&lt;p&gt;Building out the nation’s AI infrastructure is a crucial part of this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why Indonesian telecommunications leader Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, aka Indosat or IOH, has partnered with Cisco and NVIDIA to support the establishment of Indonesia’s AI Center of Excellence (CoE). Led by the Ministry of Communications and Digital Affairs, called Komdigi, the CoE aims to advance secure technologies, cultivate local talent and foster innovation through collaboration with startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison President Director and CEO Vikram Sinha, Cisco Chair and CEO Chuck Robbins and NVIDIA Senior Vice President of Telecom Ronnie Vasishta today detailed the purpose and potential of the CoE during a fireside chat at Indonesia AI Day, a conference focused on how artificial intelligence can fuel the nation’s digital independence and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the CoE, a new NVIDIA AI Technology Center will offer research support, NVIDIA Inception program benefits for eligible startups, and NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute training and certification to upskill local talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pull quote graphic: &amp;quot;At Indosat, we believe AI must be a force for inclusion — not just in access, but in opportunity.&amp;quot; - Vikram Sinha, President Director and CEO of IOH" class="aligncenter wp-image-83060 size-medium" height="384" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sinha-pull-quote-960x384.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the support of global partners, we’re accelerating Indonesia’s path to economic growth by ensuring Indonesians are not just users of AI, but creators and innovators,” Sinha added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The AI era demands fundamental architectural shifts and a workforce with digital skills to thrive,” Robbins said. “Together with Indosat, NVIDIA and Komdigi, Cisco will securely power the AI Center of Excellence — enabling innovation and skills development, and accelerating Indonesia’s growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Democratizing AI is more important than ever,” Vasishta added. “Through the new NVIDIA AI Technology Center, we’re helping Indonesia build a sustainable AI ecosystem that can serve as a model for nations looking to harness AI for innovation and economic growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Making AI More Accessible&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesia AI CoE will comprise an AI factory that features full-stack NVIDIA AI infrastructure — including NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, NVIDIA Cloud Partner reference architectures and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software — as well as an intelligent security system powered by Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called the Sovereign Security Operations Center Cloud Platform, the Cisco-powered system combines AI-based threat detection, localized data control and managed security services for the AI factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the sovereign AI initiatives Indonesia’s technology leaders announced with NVIDIA last year, the CoE will bolster the nation’s AI strategy through four core pillars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Graphic includes four core pillars of the work's strategic approach. 1) Sovereign Infrastructure: Establishing AI infrastructure for secure, scalable, high-performance AI workloads tailored to Indonesia’s digital ambitions. 2) Secure AI Workloads: Using Cisco’s intelligent infrastructure to connect and safeguard the nation’s digital assets and intellectual property. 3) AI for All: Giving hundreds of millions of Indonesians access to AI by 2027, breaking down geographical barriers and empowering developers across the nation. 4) Talent and Development Ecosystem: Aiming to equip 1 million people with digital skills in networking, security and AI by 2027." class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-83063" height="672" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indonesia-strategic-approaches-1680x672.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 28 independent software vendors and startups are already using IOH’s NVIDIA-powered AI infrastructure to develop cutting-edge technologies that can speed and ease workflows across higher education and research, food security, bureaucratic reform, smart cities and mobility, and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Indosat’s coverage across the archipelago, the company can reach hundreds of millions of Bahasa Indonesian speakers with its large language model (LLM)-powered applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, using Indosat’s Sahabat-AI collection of Bahasa Indonesian LLMs, the Indonesia government and Hippocratic AI are collaborating to develop an AI agent system that provides preventative outreach capabilities, such as helping women subscribers over the age of 50 schedule a mammogram. This can help prevent or combat breast cancer and other health complications across the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Sahabat-AI also enables Indosat’s AI chatbot to answer queries in the Indonesian language for various citizen and resident services. A person could ask about processes for updating their national identification card, as well as about tax rates, payment procedures, deductions and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, a government-led forum is developing trustworthy AI frameworks tailored to Indonesian values for the safe, responsible development of artificial intelligence and related policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Indosat and NVIDIA plan to deploy AI-RAN technologies that can reach even broader audiences using AI over wireless networks.&lt;/p&gt;

Babies Milayah and Rossouw arrived a few weeks ago. All babies are special, but these two set a new precedent. They’re the first to be born following "simplified" IVF performed in a mobile lab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This new mobile lab is essentially a trailer crammed with everything an embryologist needs to perform IVF on a shoestring. It was designed to deliver reproductive treatments to people who live in rural parts of low-income countries, where IVF can be prohibitively expensive or even nonexistent. And it seems to work!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While IVF is increasingly commonplace in wealthy countries&lt;/strong&gt;—around 12% of all births in Spain result from such procedures—it remains expensive and isn’t always covered by insurance or national health providers. And it’s even less accessible in low-income countries—especially for people who live in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People often assume that countries with high birth rates don’t need access to fertility treatments, says Gerhard Boshoff, an embryologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. Sub-Saharan African countries like Niger, Angola, and Benin all have birth rates above 40 per 1,000 people, which is&amp;nbsp;over four times the rates in Italy and Japan, for example.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But that doesn’t mean people in Sub-Saharan Africa don’t need IVF.&lt;/strong&gt; Globally, around&amp;nbsp;one in six adults experience infertility at some point in their lives, according to the World Health Organization. Research by the organization suggests that infertility rates are similar in high-income and low-income countries. As&amp;nbsp;the WHO’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus puts it: “Infertility does not discriminate.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many people in rural areas of low-income countries, IVF clinics simply don’t exist. South Africa is considered a “reproductive hub” of the African continent, but even in that country there&amp;nbsp;are fewer than 30 clinics for a population of over 60 million. A&amp;nbsp;recent study found there were no such clinics in Angola or Malawi.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willem Ombelet, a retired gynecologist, first noticed these disparities back in the 1980s, while he was working at an IVF lab in Pretoria.&lt;/strong&gt; “I witnessed that infertility was [more prevalent] in the black population than the white population—but they couldn’t access IVF because of apartheid,” he says. The experience spurred him to find ways to make IVF accessible for everyone. In the 1990s, he launched&amp;nbsp;The Walking Egg—a science and art project with that goal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2008, Ombelet met Jonathan Van Blerkom, a reproductive biologist and embryologist who had already been experimenting with a simplified version of IVF. Typically, embryos are cultured in an incubator that provides a sterile mix of gases. Van Blerkom’s approach was to preload tubes with the required gases and seal them with a rubber stopper. “We don’t need a fancy lab,” says Ombelet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="the interior of a trailer with an examination bench and stirrups opposite a beautiful woodland mural on the wall." class="wp-image-1119928" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG-20240918-WA0027.jpg?w=1180" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF GERHARD BOSHOFF&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eggs and sperm can be injected into the tubes through the stoppers, and the resulting embryos can be grown inside. All you really need is a good microscope and a way to keep the tube warm, says Ombelet. Once the embryos are around five days old, they can be transferred to a person’s uterus or frozen. “The cost is one tenth or one twentieth of a normal lab,” says Ombelet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ombelet, Van Blerkom, and their colleagues found that this approach appeared to work as well as regular IVF. &lt;/strong&gt;The team ran their first pilot trial at a clinic in Belgium in 2012. The first babies conceived with the simplified IVF process&amp;nbsp;were born later that year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Boshoff wondered if the team could take the show on the road. Making IVF simpler and cheaper is one thing, but getting it to people who don’t have access to IVF care is another. What if the team could pack the simplified IVF lab into a trailer and drive it around rural South Africa?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We just needed to figure out how to have everything in a very confined space,” says Boshoff.&lt;/strong&gt; As part of the Walking Egg project, he and his colleagues found a way to organize the lab equipment and squeeze in air filters. He then designed a “fold-out system” that allowed the team to create a second room when the trailer was parked. This provides some privacy for people who are having embryos transferred, he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People who want to use the mobile IVF lab will first have to undergo treatment at a local medical facility, where they will take drugs that stimulate their ovaries to release eggs, and then have those eggs collected. The rest of the process can be done in the mobile lab, says Boshoff, who presented his work at&amp;nbsp;the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology’s annual meeting in Paris earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first trial started last year. &lt;/strong&gt;The team partnered with one of the few existing fertility clinics in rural South Africa, which put them in touch with 10 willing volunteers. Five of the 10 women got pregnant following their simplified IVF in the mobile lab. One miscarried, but four pregnancies continued. On June 18, baby Milayah arrived. Two days later, another mother welcomed baby Rossouw. The other babies could come any day now.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’ve proven that a very cheap and easy [IVF] method can be used even in a mobile unit and have comparable results to regular IVF,” says Ombelet, who says his team is planning similar trials in Egypt and Indonesia. “The next step is to roll it out all over the world.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

But the global early warning system that alerts security teams to dangerous software flaws is showing critical gaps in coverage—and most users have no idea their digital lives are likely becoming more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the past eighteen months, two pillars of global cybersecurity have flirted with apparent collapse. In February 2024, the US-backed National Vulnerability Database (NVD)—relied on globally for its free analysis of security threats—abruptly stopped publishing new entries, citing a cryptic “change in interagency support.” Then, in April of this year, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, the fundamental numbering system for tracking software flaws, seemed at similar risk: A leaked letter warned of an imminent contract expiration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity practitioners have since flooded Discord channels and LinkedIn feeds with emergency posts and memes of “NVD” and “CVE” engraved on tombstones. Unpatched vulnerabilities are the second most common way cyberattackers break in, and they have led to fatal hospital outages and critical infrastructure failures. In a social media post, Jen Easterly, a US cybersecurity expert, said: “Losing [CVE] would be like tearing out the card catalog from every library at once—leaving defenders to sort through chaos while attackers take full advantage.” If CVEs identify each vulnerability like a book in a card catalog, NVD entries provide the detailed review with context around severity, scope, and exploitability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) extended funding for CVE another year, attributing the incident to a “contract administration issue.” But the NVD’s story has proved more complicated. Its parent organization, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), reportedly saw its budget cut roughly 12% in 2024, right around the time that CISA pulled its $3.7 million in annual funding for the NVD. Shortly after, as the backlog grew, CISA launched its own “Vulnrichment” program to help address the analysis gap, while promoting a more distributed approach that allows multiple authorized partners to publish enriched data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“CISA continuously assesses how to most effectively allocate limited resources to help organizations reduce the risk of newly disclosed vulnerabilities,” says Sandy Radesky, the agency’s associate director for vulnerability management. Rather than just filling the gap, she emphasizes that Vulnrichment was established to provide unique additional information, like recommended actions for specific stakeholders, and to “reduce dependency of the federal government’s role to be the sole provider of vulnerability enrichment.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, NIST has scrambled to hire contractors to help clear the backlog. Despite a return to pre-crisis processing levels, a boom in vulnerabilities newly disclosed to the NVD has outpaced these efforts. Currently, over 25,000 vulnerabilities await processing – nearly 10 times the previous high in 2017, according to data from software company Anchore. Before that, the NVD largely kept pace with CVE publications, maintaining a minimal backlog.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Things have been disruptive, and we’ve been going through times of change across the board,” Matthew Scholl, then chief of the computer security division in NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory, said at an industry event in April. “Leadership has assured me and everyone that NVD is and will continue to be a mission priority for NIST, both in resourcing and capabilities.” Scholl left NIST in May after 20 years at the agency, and NIST declined to comment on the backlog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The situation has now prompted multiple government actions, with the Department of Commerce launching an audit of the NVD in May and House Democrats calling for a broader probe of both programs in June. But the damage to trust is already transforming geopolitics and supply chains as security teams prepare for a new era of cyber risk. “It’s left a bad taste, and people are realizing they can’t rely on this,” says Rose Gupta, who builds and runs enterprise vulnerability management programs. “Even if they get everything together tomorrow with a bigger budget, I don’t know that this won’t happen again. So I have to make sure I have other controls in place.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As these public resources falter, organizations and governments are confronting a critical weakness in our digital infrastructure: Essential global cybersecurity services depend on a complex web of US agency interests and government funding that can be cut or redirected at any time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security haves and have-nots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What began as a trickle of software vulnerabilities in the early Internet era has become an unstoppable avalanche, and the free databases that have tracked them for decades have struggled to keep up. In early July, the CVE database crossed over 300,000 catalogued vulnerabilities. Numbers jump unpredictably each year, sometimes by 10% or much more. Even before its latest crisis, the NVD was notorious for delayed publication of new vulnerability analyses, often trailing private security software and vendor advisories by weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gupta has watched organizations increasingly adopt commercial vulnerability management (VM) software that includes its own threat intelligence services. “We’ve definitely become over-reliant on our VM tools,” she notes, describing security teams’ growing dependence on vendors like Qualys, Rapid7, and Tenable to supplement or replace unreliable public databases. These platforms combine their own research with various data sources to create proprietary risk scores that help teams prioritize fixes. But not all organizations can afford to fill the NVD’s gap with premium security tools. “Smaller companies and startups, already at a disadvantage, are going to be more at risk,” she explains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Komal Rawat, a security engineer in New Delhi whose mid-stage cloud startup has a limited budget, describes the impact in stark terms: “If NVD goes, there will be a crisis in the market. Other databases are not that popular, and to the extent they are adopted, they are not free. If you don’t have recent data, you’re exposed to attackers who do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The growing backlog means new devices could be more likely to have vulnerability blind spots—whether that’s a Ring doorbell at home or an office building’s “smart” access control system. The biggest risk may be “one-off” security flaws that fly under the radar. “There are thousands of vulnerabilities that will not affect the majority of enterprises,” says Gupta. “Those are the ones that we’re not getting analysis on, which would leave us at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NIST acknowledges it has limited visibility into which organizations are most affected by the backlog. “We don’t track which industries use which products and therefore cannot measure impact to specific industries,” a spokesperson says. Instead, the team prioritizes vulnerabilities on the basis of CISA’s known exploits list and those included in vendor advisories like Microsoft Patch Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Brian Martin has watched this system evolve—and deteriorate—from the inside. A former CVE board member and an original project leader behind the Open Source Vulnerability Database, he has built a combative reputation over the decades as a leading historian and practitioner. Martin says his current project, VulnDB (part of Flashpoint Security), outperforms the official databases he once helped oversee. “Our team processes more vulnerabilities, at a much faster turnaround, and we do it for a fraction of the cost," he says, referring to the tens of millions in government contracts that support the current system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we spoke in May, Martin said his database contains more than 112,000 vulnerabilities with no CVE identifiers—security flaws that exist in the wild but remain invisible to organizations that rely solely on public channels. “If you gave me the money to triple my team, that non-CVE number would be in the 500,000 range,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the US, official vulnerability management duties are split between a web of contractors, agencies, and nonprofit centers like the Mitre Corporation. Critics like Martin say&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that creates potential for redundancy, confusion, and inefficiency, with layers of middle management and relatively few actual vulnerability experts. Others defend the value of this fragmentation. “These programs build on or complement each other to create a more comprehensive, supportive, and diverse community,” CISA said in a statement. “That increases the resilience and usefulness of the entire ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As American leadership wavers, other nations are stepping up. China now operates multiple vulnerability databases, some surprisingly robust but tainted by the possibility that they are subject to state control. In May, the European Union accelerated the launch of its own database, as well as a decentralized “Global CVE” architecture. Following social media and cloud services, vulnerability intelligence has become another front in the contest for technological independence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That leaves security professionals to navigate multiple, potentially conflicting sources of data. “It’s going to be a mess, but I would rather have too much information than none at all,” says Gupta, describing how her team monitors multiple databases despite the added complexity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resetting software liability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As defenders adapt to the fragmenting landscape, the tech industry faces another reckoning: Why don’t software vendors carry more responsibility for protecting their customers from security issues? Major vendors routinely disclose—but don’t necessarily patch—thousands of new vulnerabilities each year. A single exposure could crash critical systems or increase the risks of fraud and data misuse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For decades, the industry has hidden behind legal shields. “Shrink-wrap licenses” once forced consumers to broadly waive their right to hold software vendors liable for defects. Today’s end-user license agreements (EULAs), often delivered in pop-up browser windows, have evolved into incomprehensibly long documents. Last November, a lab project called “EULAS of Despair” used the length of &lt;em&gt;War and Peace&lt;/em&gt; (587,287 words) to measure these sprawling contracts. The worst offender? Twitter, at 15.83 novels’ worth of fine print.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This is a legal fiction that we’ve created around this whole ecosystem, and it’s just not sustainable,” says Andrea Matwyshyn, a US special advisor and technology law professor at Penn State University, where she directs the Policy Innovation Lab of Tomorrow. “Some people point to the fact that software can contain a mix of products and services, creating more complex facts. But just like in engineering or financial litigation, even the most messy scenarios can be resolved with the assistance of experts.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This liability shield is finally beginning to crack. In July 2024, a faulty security update in CrowdStrike’s popular endpoint detection software crashed millions of Windows computers worldwide and caused outages at everything from airlines to hospitals to 911 systems. The incident led to billions in estimated damages, and the city of Portland, Oregon, even declared a “state of emergency.” Now, affected companies like Delta Airlines have hired high-priced attorneys to pursue major damages—a signal opening of the floodgates to litigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the soaring number of vulnerabilities, many fall into long-established categories, such as SQL injections that interfere with database queries and buffer memory overflows that enable code to be executed remotely. Matwyshyn advocates for a mandatory “software bill of materials,” or S-BOM—an ingredients list that would let organizations understand what components and potential vulnerabilities exist throughout their software supply chains. One recent report found 30% of data breaches stemmed from the vulnerabilities of third-party software vendors or cloud service providers.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;She adds: “When you can’t tell the difference between the companies that are cutting corners and a company that has really invested in doing right by their customers, that results in a market where everyone loses.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CISA leadership shares this sentiment, with a spokesperson emphasizing its “secure-by-design principles,” such as “making essential security features available without additional cost, eliminating classes of vulnerabilities, and building products in a way that reduces the cybersecurity burden on customers.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding a digital ‘dark age’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It will likely come as no surprise that practitioners are looking to AI to help fill the gap, while at the same time preparing for a coming swarm of cyberattacks by AI agents. Security researchers have used an OpenAI model to discover new “zero-day” vulnerabilities. And both the NVD and CVE teams are developing “AI-powered tools” to help streamline data collection, identification, and processing. NIST says that “up to 65% of our analysis time has been spent generating CPEs”—product information codes that pinpoint affected software. If AI can solve even part of this tedious process, it could dramatically speed up the analysis pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Martin cautions against optimism around AI, noting that the technology remains unproven and often riddled with inaccuracies—which, in security, can be fatal. “Rather than AI or ML [machine learning], there are ways to strategically automate bits of the processing of that vulnerability data while ensuring 99.5% accuracy,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI also fails to address more fundamental challenges in governance. The CVE Foundation, launched in April 2025 by breakaway board members, proposes a globally funded nonprofit model similar to that of the internet’s addressing system, which transitioned from US government control to international governance. Other security leaders are pushing to revitalize open-source alternatives like Google’s OSV Project or the NVD++ (maintained by VulnCheck), which are accessible to the public but currently have limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As these various reform efforts gain momentum, the world is waking up to the fact that vulnerability intelligence—like disease surveillance or aviation safety—requires sustained cooperation and public investment. Without it, a patchwork of paid databases will be all that remains, threatening to leave all but the richest organizations and nations permanently exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew King is a technology and environmental journalist based in New York.

A single exposure could crash critical systems or increase the risks of fraud and data misuse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For decades, the industry has hidden behind legal shields. “Shrink-wrap licenses” once forced consumers to broadly waive their right to hold software vendors liable for defects. Today’s end-user license agreements (EULAs), often delivered in pop-up browser windows, have evolved into incomprehensibly long documents. Last November, a lab project called “EULAS of Despair” used the length of &lt;em&gt;War and Peace&lt;/em&gt; (587,287 words) to measure these sprawling contracts. The worst offender? Twitter, at 15.83 novels’ worth of fine print.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This is a legal fiction that we’ve created around this whole ecosystem, and it’s just not sustainable,” says Andrea Matwyshyn, a US special advisor and technology law professor at Penn State University, where she directs the Policy Innovation Lab of Tomorrow. “Some people point to the fact that software can contain a mix of products and services, creating more complex facts. But just like in engineering or financial litigation, even the most messy scenarios can be resolved with the assistance of experts.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This liability shield is finally beginning to crack. In July 2024, a faulty security update in CrowdStrike’s popular endpoint detection software crashed millions of Windows computers worldwide and caused outages at everything from airlines to hospitals to 911 systems. The incident led to billions in estimated damages, and the city of Portland, Oregon, even declared a “state of emergency.” Now, affected companies like Delta Airlines have hired high-priced attorneys to pursue major damages—a signal opening of the floodgates to litigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the soaring number of vulnerabilities, many fall into long-established categories, such as SQL injections that interfere with database queries and buffer memory overflows that enable code to be executed remotely. Matwyshyn advocates for a mandatory “software bill of materials,” or S-BOM—an ingredients list that would let organizations understand what components and potential vulnerabilities exist throughout their software supply chains. One recent report found 30% of data breaches stemmed from the vulnerabilities of third-party software vendors or cloud service providers.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;She adds: “When you can’t tell the difference between the companies that are cutting corners and a company that has really invested in doing right by their customers, that results in a market where everyone loses.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CISA leadership shares this sentiment, with a spokesperson emphasizing its “secure-by-design principles,” such as “making essential security features available without additional cost, eliminating classes of vulnerabilities, and building products in a way that reduces the cybersecurity burden on customers.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding a digital ‘dark age’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It will likely come as no surprise that practitioners are looking to AI to help fill the gap, while at the same time preparing for a coming swarm of cyberattacks by AI agents. Security researchers have used an OpenAI model to discover new “zero-day” vulnerabilities. And both the NVD and CVE teams are developing “AI-powered tools” to help streamline data collection, identification, and processing. NIST says that “up to 65% of our analysis time has been spent generating CPEs”—product information codes that pinpoint affected software. If AI can solve even part of this tedious process, it could dramatically speed up the analysis pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Martin cautions against optimism around AI, noting that the technology remains unproven and often riddled with inaccuracies—which, in security, can be fatal. “Rather than AI or ML [machine learning], there are ways to strategically automate bits of the processing of that vulnerability data while ensuring 99.5% accuracy,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI also fails to address more fundamental challenges in governance. The CVE Foundation, launched in April 2025 by breakaway board members, proposes a globally funded nonprofit model similar to that of the internet’s addressing system, which transitioned from US government control to international governance. Other security leaders are pushing to revitalize open-source alternatives like Google’s OSV Project or the NVD++ (maintained by VulnCheck), which are accessible to the public but currently have limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As these various reform efforts gain momentum, the world is waking up to the fact that vulnerability intelligence—like disease surveillance or aviation safety—requires sustained cooperation and public investment. Without it, a patchwork of paid databases will be all that remains, threatening to leave all but the richest organizations and nations permanently exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew King is a technology and environmental journalist based in New York.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RealSense sells cameras that use stereoscopic imaging, a process that combines two images of the same object from different angles to create depth, enhanced with infrared light. This technology helps machines like robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles have a better perception of the physical world around them. The tech is also used for facial authentication.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The common denominator of all of them is they live in the real, physical world,” CEO Nadav Orbach told TechCrunch. “They need to understand the surroundings in 3D and based on that, take and plan actions right in the world. And for that, they need a real-time, high-accuracy ability to understand the surrounding in 3D. And that’s what we do best.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Orbach joined Intel back in 2006 as a CPU architect in Israel. He started working on vision technology in 2011 before becoming the general manager of incubation and disruptive innovation in 2022 and moving to San Francisco last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We knew and understood that 3D perception was going to be big,” Orbach said about the early days of RealSense. “To be honest, we weren’t quite sure in which domain. We tried that across different market segments and different applications, all the way from gesture recognition with computers, phones, until we really found our sweet spot over the years, mostly in robotics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company works with numerous industries outside of robotics, too. Orbach said they’ve heard from fish farms looking to track the volume inside their pens. Chipotle has also used RealSense cameras, in a partnership with AI restaurant software company PreciTaste, to track when food containers are low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RealSense has more than 3,000 customers and has seen a surge in new interest over the last three to four years as AI has improved. With that, the applications for robotics, especially, have scaled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company realized it may have a better chance keeping up with demand —&amp;nbsp;and scaling itself — if it spun out of Intel and raised its own capital, Orbach said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The spinout plans hatched last year and got the approval from former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger. The company is now independent and raised a $50 million Series A funding round from Intel Capital and other strategic investors to get started on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“For me, it was exciting, to be honest,” Orbach said. “I’m a veteran executive in the company, but it’s first time that I’m, you know, I was on the other side of the table. It was a very humbling experience for me as a first-time CEO to go and and raise money.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RealSense will put the capital toward building out its go-to-market team and making improvements to its technology. The company is particularly focused on improving the tech so it can help improve safety during humans and robot interactions and to improve access control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There is a learning curve of, you know, stepping out,” Orbach said. “I’m extremely excited about that. I’m fortunate to have a very strong team with a lot of people in my team that that have entrepreneurial experience. I feel that with my background, together with with some strong teammates, I think we have the right mix for success. And for me, it’s a dream coming true.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Family-no-droplets.png?w=898" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;After 14 years of developing inside of semiconductor giant Intel, RealSense is striking out on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first babies have been born following “simplified” IVF in a mobile lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This week I’m sending congratulations to two sets of new parents in South Africa. Babies Milayah and Rossouw arrived a few weeks ago. All babies are special, but these two set a new precedent. They’re the first to be born following "simplified" IVF performed in a mobile lab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This new mobile lab is essentially a trailer crammed with everything an embryologist needs to perform IVF on a shoestring. It was designed to deliver reproductive treatments to people who live in rural parts of low-income countries, where IVF can be prohibitively expensive or even nonexistent. And best of all: it seems to work!

But the global early warning system that alerts security teams to dangerous software flaws is showing critical gaps in coverage—and most users have no idea their digital lives are likely becoming more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the past eighteen months, two pillars of global cybersecurity have been shaken by funding issues: the US-backed National Vulnerability Database (NVD)—relied on globally for its free analysis of security threats—and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, the numbering system for tracking software flaws.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although the situation for both has stabilized, organizations and governments are confronting a critical weakness in our digital infrastructure: Essential global cybersecurity services depend on a complex web of US agency interests and government funding that can be cut or redirected at any time.
