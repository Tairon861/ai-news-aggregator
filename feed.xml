The company is building two massive data centers, and reporting indicates there will be as much as $600 billion in spending on U.S. infrastructure over the next three years. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those figures might not raise eyebrows in Silicon Valley, but they’re starting to make Wall Street nervous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The issue came to a head this week as Meta reported quarterly earnings, which showed the company’s operating expenses jumping $7 billion year-over-year and nearly $20 billion in capital expense. It was the result of intense spending on AI talent and infrastructure, which has yet to bring in meaningful revenue for the company. When analysts pressed for more specifics, Mark Zuckerberg made it clear the spending was just getting started.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we’re doing, and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business,” Zuckerberg told analysts on the call. “Our view is that when we get the new models that we’re building in MSL in there and get like truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don’t have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If his goal was to reassure investors, it didn’t work. By the end of the call, Meta’s share price had&amp;nbsp;plummeted in value. Two days later, the rout has only deepened. The Meta’s stock dropped 12% by the closing bell on Friday,&amp;nbsp;representing more than $200 billion in lost market cap.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s dangerous to read too much into stock prices, and in strict financial terms, Meta’s quarterly earnings weren’t that bad. ($20 billion in quarterly profit is nothing to complain about.) But this was the first quarter in which Meta’s aggressive AI spending on both talent and infrastructure had a visible impact on the company’s bottom line. Even more alarming was that, aside from a lot of enormous data centers and well-compensated AI researchers, it wasn’t clear what the money actually bought.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Analysts pressed Zuckerberg on why he was spending so much on AI, and when they could expect to see revenue from the growing spending. But the call came at an odd spot in Meta’s planning, with no clear budget for projected spending and no available product that could anchor a revenue forecast. As a result, Zuckerberg was left with only general claims about the promise of AI.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There are going to be all kinds of new products around different content formats, and we’re starting to see that,” he asid during the call. “And then there are the business versions of all these too, like business A … the other part is how more intelligent models are just going to improve the core business and improve the recommendations that we make across the Family of Apps and improve the recommendations in advertising.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta isn’t the only company spending billions of dollars on AI infrastructure, so it’s worth teasing out why this same spending isn’t spooking investors at Google or Nvidia, both of which&amp;nbsp;had a great quarter. OpenAI is the biggest offender, spending the same amount with far less financial cushion than Meta. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There really are concerns that we’re creating a bubble, and if we are, Meta’s core business will let it ride things out better than most.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But if you ask Sam Altman why he’s spending hundreds of billions of dollars on compute, he’ll tell you he’s operating one of the fastest growing consumer services in human history — and one&amp;nbsp;bringing in $20 billion a year in revenue. We can argue about how sustainable the growth rate is (that’s a separate blog post), but there really is a fast-growing product at the bottom of all the OpenAI hype. A fast-growing ARR figure goes a long way to answer questions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta doesn’t have a product like that, and it’s not clear where it’s going to come from. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s most powerful AI product is the Meta AI assistant, which Zuckerberg noted on the call has more than a billion active users. But those numbers are surely juiced by the three billion active users on Facebook and Instagram, and it’s hard to see the current version of Meta AI as a competitor to ChatGPT. There’s also the Vibes video generator, which really did boost daily active users, but has limited business impact beyond that. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The most ambitious project is the Vanguard smart glasses released earlier this month. However, the glasses feel more like an extension of Meta’s Reality Labs work than a real attempt to harness the power of LLMs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Put simply, these are promising experiments, not fully formed products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s telling then that when he was pressed on infrastructure spending, Zuckerberg’s response wasn’t to point to the recent launches, but to focus on the next generation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zuckerberg stressed, while emphasizing the pending impact of the Superintelligence Lab’s new models,&amp;nbsp;that he was very excited about new products. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s not just Meta AI as an assistant,” he said. “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But this was an earnings call, not a product launch, so all he could say was that there would be more to share “in the coming months.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As the market response showed that answer is wearing thin. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To be fair, it’s only been four months since Zuckerberg restructured his company’s AI team, and the new Superintelligence team hasn’t had time to launch an earthshaking AI product yet. But as the company spends billions of dollars to stay competitive in AI, there’s still no clear indication of what role Zuckerberg wants to play in the new industry. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Will Meta AI use the company’s detailed store of personal data to grow into a ChatGPT competitor? Is Vibes the first step in a consumer entertainment play, building off Meta’s targeted ad system? Or maybe Zuckerberg’s references to “business AI” are hints at a more detailed enterprise play?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So far, it’s anyone’s guess. Whatever the answer, the pressure is on Meta to find it — and soon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2173579243.jpg?resize=1200,799" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;In the midst of an unprecedented AI buildout, Meta is spending more than most.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;His comments came up during a joint interview on the Bg2 podcast between Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about the partnership between their companies. Host Brad Gerstner (who’s also founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital) brought up reports that OPenAI is currently bringing in around $13 billion in revenue — a sizable amount, but one that’s dwarfed by more than $1 trillion in spending commitments for computing infrastructure that OpenAI has made for the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“First of all, we’re doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” Altman said, prompting laughs from Nadella. “I just — enough. I think there are a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Including myself,” Gerstner interjected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman then added that there are critics who “talk with a lot of breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy our shares.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, he said that although there are “not many times” when he wants OpenAI to be a public company, “One of the rare times it’s appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous ‘OpenAI is about to go out of business’ [posts], I would love to tell them they could just short the stock, and I would love to see them get burned on that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman acknowledged that there are ways the company “might screw it up” — for example by failing to get access to enough computing resources — but he said that “revenue is growing steeply.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are taking a forward bet that it will continue to grow, and that not only will ChatGPT keep growing, but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds, that our consumer device business will be a significant and important thing, that AI that can automate science will create huge value,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nadella also claimed that OpenAI has “beaten” every business plan that it’s given Microsoft as an investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gerstner returned to the subject of OpenAI’s revenues and IPO plans later in the interview, when he speculated about the company reaching $100 billion in revenue in 2028 or 2029.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“How about ‘27?” Altman countered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, he denied reports that OpenAI plans to go public next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“No no no, we don’t have anything that specific,” Altman said. “I’m a realist, I assume it will happen someday, but I don’t know why people write these reports. We don’t have a date in mind, we don’t have a board decision to do this or anything like that. I just assume it’s where things will eventually go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Senator Marsha Blackburn — a Republican from Tennessee — said that when Gemma was asked, “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?” it responded by falsely claiming that during a 1987 state senate campaign, a state trooper alleged that Blackburn “pressured him to obtain prescription drugs for her and that the relationship involved non-consensual acts.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“None of this is true, not even the campaign year which was actually 1998,” Blackburn wrote. While there are links to news articles that supposedly support these claims, she said, “The links lead to error pages and unrelated news articles. There has never been such an accusation, there is no such individual, and there are no such news stories.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter also said that during a recent Senate Commerce hearing, Blackburn brought up conservative activist Robby Starbuck’s lawsuit against Google, in which Starbuck claims Google’s AI models (including Gemma) generated defamatory claims about him being a “child rapist” and “serial sexual abuser.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As recounted in Blackburn’s letter, Google’s Vice President for Government Affairs and Public Policy Markham Erickson responded that hallucinations are a known issue and Google is “working hard to mitigate them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blackburn’s letter argued that on the contrary, Gemma’s fabrications are “not a harmless ‘hallucination,’” but rather “an act of defamation produced and distributed by a Google-owned AI model.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;President Donald Trump’s tech industry supporters have complained that “AI censorship” causes popular chatbots to show a liberal bias, and Trump even signed an executive order banning “woke AI” earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Blackburn hasn’t always backed the Trump administration’s tech policies — she helped to strip a moratorium on state-level AI regulation from Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” — she echoed those complaints in her letter, writing that there’s “a consistent pattern of bias against conservative figures demonstrated by Google’s AI systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a Friday night post on X, Google did not reference the specifics of Blackburn’s letter, but the company said it’s “seen reports of non-developers trying to use Gemma in AI Studio and ask it factual questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We never intended this to be a consumer tool or model, or to be used this way,” the company said. (Google promotes Gemma as a family of open, lightweight models that developers can integrate into their own products, while AI Studio is the company’s web-based development environment for AI-powered apps.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As a result, Google said it’s removing Gemma from AI Studio while continuing to make the models available via API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has reached out to Google for additional comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sundar-AI-backdrop-Google-IO.png?w=947" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google says it has removed Gemma from its AI Studio after a U.S. senator accused the AI model of fabricating accusations of sexual misconduct against her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Senator Marsha Blackburn — a Republican from Tennessee — said that when Gemma was asked, “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?” it responded by falsely claiming that during a 1987 state senate campaign, a state trooper alleged that Blackburn “pressured him to obtain prescription drugs for her and that the relationship involved non-consensual acts.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“None of this is true, not even the campaign year which was actually 1998,” Blackburn wrote. While there are links to news articles that supposedly support these claims, she said, “The links lead to error pages and unrelated news articles. There has never been such an accusation, there is no such individual, and there are no such news stories.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter also said that during a recent Senate Commerce hearing, Blackburn brought up conservative activist Robby Starbuck’s lawsuit against Google, in which Starbuck claims Google’s AI models (including Gemma) generated defamatory claims about him being a “child rapist” and “serial sexual abuser.”&lt;/p&gt;
