Neither companies provided details about the financial terms of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Superhuman was founded by Rahul Vohra, Vivek Sodera, and Conrad Irwin. The company raised more than $114 million in funding from backers including a16z, IVP, and Tiger Global, with its last valuation at $825 million, according to data from venture data analytics firm Traxcn.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With Superhuman, we can deliver that future to millions more professionals while giving our existing users another surface for agent collaboration that simply doesn’t exist anywhere else. Email isn’t just another app; it’s where professionals spend significant portions of their day, and it’s the perfect staging ground for orchestrating multiple AI agents simultaneously,” Shishir Mehrotra, CEO of Grammarly, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With this deal, CEO Vohra and other Superhuman employees are moving over to Grammarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Email is the main communication tool for billions of people worldwide and the number-one use case for Grammarly customers. By joining forces with Grammarly, we will invest even more in the core Superhuman experience, as well as create a new way of working where AI agents collaborate across the communication tools that we all use every day,” Rahul Vohra, CEO of Superhuman, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the last few months, Superhuman has released AI-powered features related to scheduling, replies, and categorization. In its announcement, Grammarly said that it wants to build AI agents for emails using Superhuman’s tech. The company said that email remains one of the top use cases for Grammarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last year, Grammarly acquired collaborative productivity software Coda, and as part of the deal, promoted Coda’s co-founder, Shishir Mehrotra, to CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May, Grammarly raised $1 billion from General Catalyst in a non-dilutive investment. Rather than giving up equity, the company will pay back General Catalyst the money with a capped percentage of revenue it creates using the venture firm’s money.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grammarly-Abstract.jpg?resize=1200,632" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Grammarly announced Tuesday the acquisition of email client Superhuman in a push to build out its AI for its productivity suite.

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Facing overwhelming opposition from both Democrats and Republicans, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) accepted defeat and joined a 99-1 vote against his own plan to punish states that regulate artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Senate came together tonight to say that we can't just run over good state consumer protection laws," Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) said. The Cruz plan would have thwarted state laws related to robocalls, deepfakes, and autonomous vehicles, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House previously approved a budget bill with a provision to ban state AI regulation for 10 years. The Senate has a rule against including "extraneous matter" in budget reconciliation legislation, which Cruz tried to get around by proposing a 10-year moratorium in which states would be shut out of a $42 billion broadband deployment fund if they try to regulate AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate passed the overall budget bill today in a 51-50 vote. Cruz's office said in early June that his proposal aimed to prevent states "from strangling AI deployment with EU-style regulation." Less than three weeks later, his home state of Texas enacted a law regulating the use of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruz changed his plan, saying that states regulating AI would only be shut out of a $500 million AI fund instead of the $42 billion broadband fund. But Cantwell's office said the new version contained a backdoor that could still threaten states' access to the entire broadband fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) teamed up with Cantwell to fight Cruz's plan. Blackburn briefly reached a compromise with Cruz on a five-year moratorium that would allow some forms of AI regulation but then decided the compromise wasn't good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While I appreciate Chairman Cruz's efforts to find acceptable language that allows states to protect their citizens from the abuses of AI, the current language is not acceptable to those who need these protections the most," Blackburn said in a statement quoted by Politico last night. "This provision could allow Big Tech to continue to exploit kids, creators, and conservatives. Until Congress passes federally preemptive legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act and an online privacy framework, we can't block states from making laws that protect their citizens."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;Cruz blamed “outside interests”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the compromise fell apart, the Senate voted 99-1 for Blackburn's amendment to remove the AI provision from the budget bill. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) cast the only vote against the amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cruz ultimately got behind Blackburn's amendment early Tuesday, acknowledging that 'many of my colleagues would prefer not to vote on this matter,'" according to The Hill. Cruz said the five-year moratorium had support from President Trump and "protected kids and protected the rights of creative artists, but outside interests opposed that deal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Blackburn was quoted as saying that they "weren't able to come to a compromise that would protect our governors, our state legislators, our attorney generals and, of course, House members who have expressed concern over this language... what we know is this—this body has proven that they cannot legislate on emerging technology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell pointed out that many state government officials from both major parties opposed the Cruz plan. "Despite several revisions by its author and misleading assurances about its true impact, state officials from across the country, including 17 Republican Governors and 40 state attorneys general, as well [as] conservative and liberal organizations—from the Heritage Foundation to the Center for American Progress—rallied against the harmful proposal," Cantwell's office said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) had also filed an amendment to strip the AI moratorium from the bill. Markey said yesterday that "the Blackburn-Cruz so-called compromise is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Despite Republican efforts to hide the true impact of the AI moratorium, the language still allows the Trump administration to use federal broadband funding as a weapon against the states and still prevents states from protecting children online from Big Tech's predatory behavior."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell said at a recent press conference that 24 states last year started "regulating AI in some way, and they have adopted these laws that fill a gap while we are waiting for federal action." Yesterday, she called the Blackburn/Cruz compromise "another giveaway to tech companies" that "gives AI and social media a brand-new shield against litigation and state regulation."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Facing overwhelming opposition from both Democrats and Republicans, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) accepted defeat and joined a 99-1 vote against his own plan to punish states that regulate artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Senate came together tonight to say that we can't just run over good state consumer protection laws," Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) said. The Cruz plan would have thwarted state laws related to robocalls, deepfakes, and autonomous vehicles, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House previously approved a budget bill with a provision to ban state AI regulation for 10 years. The Senate has a rule against including "extraneous matter" in budget reconciliation legislation, which Cruz tried to get around by proposing a 10-year moratorium in which states would be shut out of a $42 billion broadband deployment fund if they try to regulate AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate passed the overall budget bill today in a 51-50 vote. Cruz's office said in early June that his proposal aimed to prevent states "from strangling AI deployment with EU-style regulation." Less than three weeks later, his home state of Texas enacted a law regulating the use of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruz changed his plan, saying that states regulating AI would only be shut out of a $500 million AI fund instead of the $42 billion broadband fund. But Cantwell's office said the new version contained a backdoor that could still threaten states' access to the entire broadband fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) teamed up with Cantwell to fight Cruz's plan. Blackburn briefly reached a compromise with Cruz on a five-year moratorium that would allow some forms of AI regulation but then decided the compromise wasn't good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While I appreciate Chairman Cruz's efforts to find acceptable language that allows states to protect their citizens from the abuses of AI, the current language is not acceptable to those who need these protections the most," Blackburn said in a statement quoted by Politico last night. "This provision could allow Big Tech to continue to exploit kids, creators, and conservatives. Until Congress passes federally preemptive legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act and an online privacy framework, we can't block states from making laws that protect their citizens."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cruz blamed “outside interests”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the compromise fell apart, the Senate voted 99-1 for Blackburn's amendment to remove the AI provision from the budget bill. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) cast the only vote against the amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cruz ultimately got behind Blackburn's amendment early Tuesday, acknowledging that 'many of my colleagues would prefer not to vote on this matter,'" according to The Hill. Cruz said the five-year moratorium had support from President Trump and "protected kids and protected the rights of creative artists, but outside interests opposed that deal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Blackburn was quoted as saying that they "weren't able to come to a compromise that would protect our governors, our state legislators, our attorney generals and, of course, House members who have expressed concern over this language... what we know is this—this body has proven that they cannot legislate on emerging technology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell pointed out that many state government officials from both major parties opposed the Cruz plan. "Despite several revisions by its author and misleading assurances about its true impact, state officials from across the country, including 17 Republican Governors and 40 state attorneys general, as well [as] conservative and liberal organizations—from the Heritage Foundation to the Center for American Progress—rallied against the harmful proposal," Cantwell's office said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) had also filed an amendment to strip the AI moratorium from the bill. Markey said yesterday that "the Blackburn-Cruz so-called compromise is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Despite Republican efforts to hide the true impact of the AI moratorium, the language still allows the Trump administration to use federal broadband funding as a weapon against the states and still prevents states from protecting children online from Big Tech's predatory behavior."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell said at a recent press conference that 24 states last year started "regulating AI in some way, and they have adopted these laws that fill a gap while we are waiting for federal action." Yesterday, she called the Blackburn/Cruz compromise "another giveaway to tech companies" that "gives AI and social media a brand-new shield against litigation and state regulation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech behemoth now has 1 million robots in its warehouses, the company announced Monday. This one millionth robot was recently delivered to an Amazon fulfillment facility in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That figure puts Amazon on track to reach another landmark: Its vast network of warehouses may soon have the same number of robots working as people, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal. The WSJ also reported that 75% of Amazon’s global deliveries are now assisted in some way by a robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch reached out to Amazon for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced it’s releasing a new generative AI model called DeepFleet for its warehouse robots. This AI model, which can coordinate the robots’ routes within the company’s warehouses more efficiently, will help increase the speed of its robotic fleet by 10%, according to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company used Amazon SageMaker — the AWS cloud studio that helps build and deploy AI models — to create DeepFleet. Amazon trained the model on its own warehouse and inventory data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon’s one millionth robot represents more than just a number. The company has improved its fleet of robots in recent years, adding new capabilities and models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May, the company unveiled its latest robot, Vulcan. This model has two arms, one designed for rearranging inventory and another with a camera and suction cup to grab items. Most notably, these Vulcan robots have a sense of “touch” that allows it to feel the items it is grabbing, according to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In October 2024, the company announced its “next-generation fulfillment centers,” which would include 10x as many robots as their current facilities, in addition to human workers. The first of these new robotic-powered centers opened shortly after in Shreveport, Louisiana, near the Texas border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon originally started building up its robotic capabilities back in 2012 alongside its acquisition of Kiva Systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/download-3.webp?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;After 13 years of deploying robots into its warehouses, Amazon reached a new milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Community Notes is a Twitter-era feature that Elon Musk has expanded under his ownership of the service, now called X. Users who are part of this fact-checking program can contribute comments that add context to certain posts, which are then checked by other users before they appear attached to a post. A Community Note may appear, for example, on a post of an AI-generated video that is not clear about its synthetic origins, or as an addendum to a misleading post from a politician.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notes become public when they achieve consensus between groups that have historically disagreed on past ratings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Community Notes have been successful enough on X to inspire Meta, TikTok, and YouTube to pursue similar initiatives — Meta eliminated its third-party fact-checking programs altogether in exchange for this low-cost, community-sourced labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But it remains to be seen if the use of AI chatbots as fact-checkers will prove helpful or harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These AI notes can be generated using X’s Grok or by using other AI tools and connecting them to X via an API. Any note that an AI submits will be treated the same as a note submitted by a person, which means that it will go through the same vetting process to encourage accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The use of AI in fact-checking seems dubious, given how common it is for AIs to hallucinate, or make up context that is not based in reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a paper published this week by researchers working on X Community Notes, it is recommended that humans and LLMs work in tandem. Human feedback can enhance AI note generation through reinforcement learning, with human note raters remaining as a final check before notes are published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The goal is not to create an AI assistant that tells users what to think, but to build an ecosystem that empowers humans to think more critically and understand the world better,” the paper says. “LLMs and humans can work together in a virtuous loop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even with human checks, there is still a risk to relying too heavily on AI, especially since users will be able to embed LLMs from third parties. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, recently experienced issues with a model being overly sycophantic. If an LLM prioritizes “helpfulness” over accurately completing a fact-check, then the AI-generated comments may end up being flat out inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s also concern that human raters will be overloaded by the amount of AI-generated comments, lowering their motivation to adequately complete this volunteer work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users shouldn’t expect to see AI-generated Community Notes yet — X plans to test these AI contributions for a few weeks before rolling them out more broadly if they’re successful.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The social platform X will pilot a feature that allows AI chatbots to generate Community Notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Community Notes is a Twitter-era feature that Elon Musk has expanded under his ownership of the service, now called X. Users who are part of this fact-checking program can contribute comments that add context to certain posts, which are then checked by other users before they appear attached to a post. A Community Note may appear, for example, on a post of an AI-generated video that is not clear about its synthetic origins, or as an addendum to a misleading post from a politician.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notes become public when they achieve consensus between groups that have historically disagreed on past ratings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Community Notes have been successful enough on X to inspire Meta, TikTok, and YouTube to pursue similar initiatives — Meta eliminated its third-party fact-checking programs altogether in exchange for this low-cost, community-sourced labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But it remains to be seen if the use of AI chatbots as fact-checkers will prove helpful or harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These AI notes can be generated using X’s Grok or by using other AI tools and connecting them to X via an API. Any note that an AI submits will be treated the same as a note submitted by a person, which means that it will go through the same vetting process to encourage accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothoff—one of the leading apps used to quickly and cheaply make fake nudes from images of real people—reportedly is planning a global expansion to continue dominating deepfake porn online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as a nudify app, Clothoff has resisted attempts to unmask and confront its operators. Last August, the app was among those that San Francisco's city attorney, David Chiu, sued in hopes of forcing a shutdown. But recently, a whistleblower—who had "access to internal company information" as a former Clothoff employee—told the investigative outlet Der Spiegel that the app's operators "seem unimpressed by the lawsuit" and instead of worrying about shutting down have "bought up an entire network of nudify apps."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Spiegel found evidence that Clothoff today owns at least 10 other nudify services, attracting "monthly views ranging between hundreds of thousands to several million." The outlet granted the whistleblower anonymity to discuss the expansion plans, which the whistleblower claimed was motivated by Clothoff employees growing "cynical" and "obsessed with money" over time as the app—which once felt like an "exciting startup"—gained momentum. Because generating convincing fake nudes can cost just a few bucks, chasing profits seemingly relies on attracting as many repeat users to as many destinations as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Clothoff runs on an annual budget of around $3.5 million, the whistleblower told Der Spiegel. It has shifted its marketing methods since its launch, apparently now largely relying on Telegram bots and X channels to target ads at young men likely to use their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Spiegel's report documents Clothoff's "large-scale marketing plan" to expand into the German market, as revealed by the whistleblower. The alleged campaign hinges on producing "naked images of well-known influencers, singers, and actresses," seeking to entice ad clicks with the tagline "you choose who you want to undress."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;A few of the stars named in the plan confirmed to Der Spiegel that they never agreed to this use of their likenesses, with some of their representatives suggesting that they would pursue legal action if the campaign is ever launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even celebrities like Taylor Swift have struggled to combat deepfake nudes spreading online, while tools like Clothoff are increasingly used to torment young girls in middle and high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar celebrity campaigns are planned for other markets, Der Spiegel reported, including British, French, and Spanish markets. And Clothoff has notably already become a go-to tool in the US, not only targeted in the San Francisco city attorney's lawsuit, but also in a complaint raised by a high schooler in New Jersey suing a boy who used Clothoff to nudify one of her Instagram photos taken when she was 14 years old, then shared it with other boys on Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothoff is seemingly hoping to entice more young boys worldwide to use its apps for such purposes. The whistleblower told Der Spiegel that most of Clothoff's marketing budget goes toward "advertising posts in special Telegram channels, in sex subs on Reddit, and on 4chan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ads, the app planned to specifically target "men between 16 and 35" who like benign stuff like "memes" and "video games," as well as more toxic stuff like "right-wing extremist ideas," "misogyny," and "Andrew Tate," an influencer criticized for promoting misogynistic views to teen boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiu was hoping to defend young women increasingly targeted in fake nudes by shutting down Clothoff, along with several other nudify apps targeted in his lawsuit. But so far, while Chiu has reached a settlement shutting down two websites, porngen.art and undresser.ai, attempts to serve Clothoff through available legal channels have not been successful, deputy press secretary for Chiu's office, Alex Barrett-Shorter, told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Clothoff continues to evolve, recently marketing a feature that Clothoff claims attracted more than a million users eager to make explicit videos out of a single picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clothoff denies it plans to use influencers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Spiegel's efforts to unmask the operators of Clothoff led the outlet to Eastern Europe, after reporters stumbled upon a "database accidentally left open on the Internet" that seemingly exposed "four central people behind the website."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was "consistent," Der Spiegel said, with a whistleblower claim that all Clothoff employees "work in countries that used to belong to the Soviet Union." Additionally, Der Spiegel noted that all Clothoff internal communications it reviewed were written in Russian, and the site's email service is based in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person claiming to be a Clothoff spokesperson named Elias denied knowing any of the four individuals flagged in their investigation, Der Spiegel reported, and disputed the $3 million budget figure. Elias claimed a nondisclosure agreement prevented him from discussing Clothoff's team any further. However, soon after reaching out, Der Spiegel noted that Clothoff took down the database, which had a name that translated to "my babe."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the shared marketing plan for global expansion, Elias denied that Clothoff intended to use celebrity influencers, saying that "Clothoff forbids the use of photos of people without their consent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also denied that Clothoff could be used to nudify images of minors; however, one Clothoff user who spoke to Der Spiegel on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that his attempt to generate a fake nude of a US singer failed initially because she "looked like she might be underage." But his second attempt a few days later successfully generated the fake nude with no problem. That suggests Clothoff's age detection may not work perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;As Clothoff's growth appears unstoppable, the user explained to Der Spiegel why he doesn’t feel that conflicted about using the app to generate fake nudes of a famous singer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are enough pictures of her on the Internet as it is," the user reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that user draws the line at generating fake nudes of private individuals, insisting, "If I ever learned of someone producing such photos of my daughter, I would be horrified."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For young boys who appear flippant about creating fake nude images of their classmates, the consequences have ranged from suspensions to juvenile criminal charges, and for some, there could be other costs. In the lawsuit where the high schooler is attempting to sue a boy who used Clothoff to bully her, there's currently resistance from boys who participated in group chats to share what evidence they have on their phones. If she wins her fight, she's asking for $150,000 in damages per image shared, so sharing chat logs could potentially increase the price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since she and the San Francisco city attorney each filed their lawsuits, the Take It Down Act has passed. That law makes it easier to force platforms to remove AI-generated fake nudes. But experts expect the law will face legal challenges over censorship fears, so the very limited legal tool might not withstand scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the Take It Down Act is a safeguard that came too late for the earliest victims of nudify apps in the US, only some of whom are turning to courts seeking justice due to largely opaque laws that made it unclear if generating a fake nude was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Jane Doe is one of many girls and women who have been and will continue to be exploited, abused, and victimized by non-consensual pornography generated through artificial intelligence," the high schooler's complaint noted. "Despite already being victimized by Defendant’s actions, Jane Doe has been forced to bring this action to protect herself and her rights because the governmental institutions that are supposed to protect women and children from being violated and exploited by the use of AI to generate child pornography and nonconsensual nude images failed to do so."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothoff—one of the leading apps used to quickly and cheaply make fake nudes from images of real people—reportedly is planning a global expansion to continue dominating deepfake porn online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as a nudify app, Clothoff has resisted attempts to unmask and confront its operators. Last August, the app was among those that San Francisco's city attorney, David Chiu, sued in hopes of forcing a shutdown. But recently, a whistleblower—who had "access to internal company information" as a former Clothoff employee—told the investigative outlet Der Spiegel that the app's operators "seem unimpressed by the lawsuit" and instead of worrying about shutting down have "bought up an entire network of nudify apps."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Spiegel found evidence that Clothoff today owns at least 10 other nudify services, attracting "monthly views ranging between hundreds of thousands to several million." The outlet granted the whistleblower anonymity to discuss the expansion plans, which the whistleblower claimed was motivated by Clothoff employees growing "cynical" and "obsessed with money" over time as the app—which once felt like an "exciting startup"—gained momentum. Because generating convincing fake nudes can cost just a few bucks, chasing profits seemingly relies on attracting as many repeat users to as many destinations as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Clothoff runs on an annual budget of around $3.5 million, the whistleblower told Der Spiegel. It has shifted its marketing methods since its launch, apparently now largely relying on Telegram bots and X channels to target ads at young men likely to use their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Spiegel's report documents Clothoff's "large-scale marketing plan" to expand into the German market, as revealed by the whistleblower. The alleged campaign hinges on producing "naked images of well-known influencers, singers, and actresses," seeking to entice ad clicks with the tagline "you choose who you want to undress."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;A few of the stars named in the plan confirmed to Der Spiegel that they never agreed to this use of their likenesses, with some of their representatives suggesting that they would pursue legal action if the campaign is ever launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even celebrities like Taylor Swift have struggled to combat deepfake nudes spreading online, while tools like Clothoff are increasingly used to torment young girls in middle and high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar celebrity campaigns are planned for other markets, Der Spiegel reported, including British, French, and Spanish markets. And Clothoff has notably already become a go-to tool in the US, not only targeted in the San Francisco city attorney's lawsuit, but also in a complaint raised by a high schooler in New Jersey suing a boy who used Clothoff to nudify one of her Instagram photos taken when she was 14 years old, then shared it with other boys on Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothoff is seemingly hoping to entice more young boys worldwide to use its apps for such purposes. The whistleblower told Der Spiegel that most of Clothoff's marketing budget goes toward "advertising posts in special Telegram channels, in sex subs on Reddit, and on 4chan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ads, the app planned to specifically target "men between 16 and 35" who like benign stuff like "memes" and "video games," as well as more toxic stuff like "right-wing extremist ideas," "misogyny," and "Andrew Tate," an influencer criticized for promoting misogynistic views to teen boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiu was hoping to defend young women increasingly targeted in fake nudes by shutting down Clothoff, along with several other nudify apps targeted in his lawsuit. But so far, while Chiu has reached a settlement shutting down two websites, porngen.art and undresser.ai, attempts to serve Clothoff through available legal channels have not been successful, deputy press secretary for Chiu's office, Alex Barrett-Shorter, told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Clothoff continues to evolve, recently marketing a feature that Clothoff claims attracted more than a million users eager to make explicit videos out of a single picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clothoff denies it plans to use influencers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Spiegel's efforts to unmask the operators of Clothoff led the outlet to Eastern Europe, after reporters stumbled upon a "database accidentally left open on the Internet" that seemingly exposed "four central people behind the website."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was "consistent," Der Spiegel said, with a whistleblower claim that all Clothoff employees "work in countries that used to belong to the Soviet Union." Additionally, Der Spiegel noted that all Clothoff internal communications it reviewed were written in Russian, and the site's email service is based in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person claiming to be a Clothoff spokesperson named Elias denied knowing any of the four individuals flagged in their investigation, Der Spiegel reported, and disputed the $3 million budget figure. Elias claimed a nondisclosure agreement prevented him from discussing Clothoff's team any further. However, soon after reaching out, Der Spiegel noted that Clothoff took down the database, which had a name that translated to "my babe."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the shared marketing plan for global expansion, Elias denied that Clothoff intended to use celebrity influencers, saying that "Clothoff forbids the use of photos of people without their consent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also denied that Clothoff could be used to nudify images of minors; however, one Clothoff user who spoke to Der Spiegel on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that his attempt to generate a fake nude of a US singer failed initially because she "looked like she might be underage." But his second attempt a few days later successfully generated the fake nude with no problem. That suggests Clothoff's age detection may not work perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;As Clothoff's growth appears unstoppable, the user explained to Der Spiegel why he doesn’t feel that conflicted about using the app to generate fake nudes of a famous singer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are enough pictures of her on the Internet as it is," the user reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that user draws the line at generating fake nudes of private individuals, insisting, "If I ever learned of someone producing such photos of my daughter, I would be horrified."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For young boys who appear flippant about creating fake nude images of their classmates, the consequences have ranged from suspensions to juvenile criminal charges, and for some, there could be other costs. In the lawsuit where the high schooler is attempting to sue a boy who used Clothoff to bully her, there's currently resistance from boys who participated in group chats to share what evidence they have on their phones. If she wins her fight, she's asking for $150,000 in damages per image shared, so sharing chat logs could potentially increase the price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since she and the San Francisco city attorney each filed their lawsuits, the Take It Down Act has passed. That law makes it easier to force platforms to remove AI-generated fake nudes. But experts expect the law will face legal challenges over censorship fears, so the very limited legal tool might not withstand scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the Take It Down Act is a safeguard that came too late for the earliest victims of nudify apps in the US, only some of whom are turning to courts seeking justice due to largely opaque laws that made it unclear if generating a fake nude was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Jane Doe is one of many girls and women who have been and will continue to be exploited, abused, and victimized by non-consensual pornography generated through artificial intelligence," the high schooler's complaint noted. "Despite already being victimized by Defendant’s actions, Jane Doe has been forced to bring this action to protect herself and her rights because the governmental institutions that are supposed to protect women and children from being violated and exploited by the use of AI to generate child pornography and nonconsensual nude images failed to do so."&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The No. 1 way AI is changing 150-year-old energy giant Chevron? How technical practitioners engage with data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Offshore in the Gulf, Chevron is drilling for oil resources miles below the ocean floor in pockets and reservoirs that may or may not yield results. Agentic architectures need to be able to process petabytes of critical data — which not only provides insights on where to drill, but how to do so without negatively impacting human lives or the environment — in the cloud and at the edge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Data is the ultimate accelerant for all of our AI use cases,” Steve Bowman, GM for enterprise AI at Chevron, said onstage at this year’s VB Transform. “It’s something that we’ve embraced in a big way.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ai-is-changing-the-way-chevron-interacts-with-its-untold-amounts-of-data"&gt;How AI is changing the way Chevron interacts with its untold amounts of data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Chevron teamed up with Microsoft and oilfield services company SLB in a project called ‘Triple Crown’ to modernize and standardize cloud-based tools. The three companies have built Azure-native apps into SLB’s DELFI* cognitive exploration and protection (E&amp;amp;P) to help Chevron process, visualize, interpret and gain meaningful insights from multiple data sources. DELFI* E&amp;amp;P covers exploration, development, production and midstream environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The $250 billion energy giant with 1,000s of employees in 180 countries worldwide has “an enormous amount of data out there,” said Bowman. And, while Chevron has “very robust systems of record,” large amounts of unstructured data have existed in a variety of share points.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Chevron has built some “really great algorithms” that have traditionally been run at small scale on-premises, he explained. However, there has been an increasing push to scale up, running those algorithms at a much larger scale and more efficiently in the cloud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By doing that, “instead of looking at one three-mile-by-three-mile block in the Gulf of Mexico or Gulf of America, we can look at much larger areas we’re trying to operate on,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-SLB collaboration has focused on three products: FDPlan, DrillPlan and DrillOps. FDPlan utilizes high-performance computing (HPC) to integrate subsurface models, enabling employees to make faster and more informed decisions in complex environments, leveraging the best available data. For instance, in the Gulf, FDPlan helps Chevron analyze different options for developing a reservoir so its teams can focus on the most optimal scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, DrillPlan is designed for engineers developing drilling plans, while DrillOps is used by teams that drill wells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the initiative, some subsurface Chevron employees were spending as much as 75% of their time looking for data, Bowman noted.&amp;nbsp; “We can see that the time people spend looking for data is beginning to decrease, and the speed at which we can get insights is really accelerating,” said Bowman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DrillPlan has also helped Chevron reduce its deepwater well planning process by 30 days. For instance, in Argentina, the company has reduced its planning cycle time for an eight-well pad from two weeks to less than a day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Bowman called the move to the cloud “a real force multiplier” that has allowed Chevron to enter into a new phase of modernization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-focus-on-modular-systems"&gt;A focus on modular systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, as they work to integrate AI, Bowman’s team is focusing heavily on modularity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pointed out that the initial ‘ask’ was search; they offered up a very simple use case allowing people to retrieve information that existed within a “very, very” complex SharePoint. But as users have engaged more and more, their asks are increasing; in response, his team has added a retrieval agent, an agent that can evaluate findings from a technical standpoint and an orchestrator agent to link the two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We really realized pretty early that we needed to lean in heavily on modularity, because we knew that these agents would be called upon in other workflows, based on the demand,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another effort is ‘Chevron Assist,’ a chat interface to operate on health, safety and environmental (HSE) standards. “We work in an enormously complex industry, and the stakes of the game are always higher,” said Bowman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tool provides a natural way for people to interact with documents related to critical standards and procedures, eliminating the need to click through links or search within documents. So, for instance, a user can combine all of the standards they need for a drilling crew, an operations crew and a maintenance crew.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We realized we weren’t thinking of the problem in the way that individual users are thinking of those things all together at once,” said Bowman. “There has been so much value in that integration. That’s really changed the way people do their work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-focusing-too-much-on-pocs"&gt;Not focusing too much on POCs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As it builds out its programs, Bowman’s team has actively avoided falling into the habit of undertaking pilots and proofs of concepts (POCs) that drag on too long. “There’s no value in that,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal has always been to deploy the most promising use cases into production, he said. Everything must be linked back to Chevron’s bottom line and offer up a strong value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know that with a curated data set and really enthusiastic, well-meaning group of users and a super narrowly defined use case, there’s almost 100% certainty that your POC will be successful,” said Bowman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another important element in deploying next-gen tools is overcoming the trust hurdle. From a behavior change standpoint, enterprise leaders must understand not only the expectations the company places on users locally and at the edge, but what those users expect in turn, said Bowman. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve built out these systems or tools in such a way that the individuals who are going to put hands on them don’t trust them, or can’t trust them, or there’s something holding them back, then you never really get the full enthusiastic deployment,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Data is the ultimate accelerant for all of our AI use cases,” Steve Bowman, GM for enterprise AI at Chevron, said onstage at this year’s VB Transform. “It’s something that we’ve embraced in a big way.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ai-is-changing-the-way-chevron-interacts-with-its-untold-amounts-of-data"&gt;How AI is changing the way Chevron interacts with its untold amounts of data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Chevron teamed up with Microsoft and oilfield services company SLB in a project called ‘Triple Crown’ to modernize and standardize cloud-based tools. The three companies have built Azure-native apps into SLB’s DELFI* cognitive exploration and protection (E&amp;amp;P) to help Chevron process, visualize, interpret and gain meaningful insights from multiple data sources. DELFI* E&amp;amp;P covers exploration, development, production and midstream environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The $250 billion energy giant with 1,000s of employees in 180 countries worldwide has “an enormous amount of data out there,” said Bowman. And, while Chevron has “very robust systems of record,” large amounts of unstructured data have existed in a variety of share points.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Chevron has built some “really great algorithms” that have traditionally been run at small scale on-premises, he explained. However, there has been an increasing push to scale up, running those algorithms at a much larger scale and more efficiently in the cloud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By doing that, “instead of looking at one three-mile-by-three-mile block in the Gulf of Mexico or Gulf of America, we can look at much larger areas we’re trying to operate on,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-SLB collaboration has focused on three products: FDPlan, DrillPlan and DrillOps. FDPlan utilizes high-performance computing (HPC) to integrate subsurface models, enabling employees to make faster and more informed decisions in complex environments, leveraging the best available data. For instance, in the Gulf, FDPlan helps Chevron analyze different options for developing a reservoir so its teams can focus on the most optimal scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, DrillPlan is designed for engineers developing drilling plans, while DrillOps is used by teams that drill wells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the initiative, some subsurface Chevron employees were spending as much as 75% of their time looking for data, Bowman noted.&amp;nbsp; “We can see that the time people spend looking for data is beginning to decrease, and the speed at which we can get insights is really accelerating,” said Bowman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DrillPlan has also helped Chevron reduce its deepwater well planning process by 30 days. For instance, in Argentina, the company has reduced its planning cycle time for an eight-well pad from two weeks to less than a day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Bowman called the move to the cloud “a real force multiplier” that has allowed Chevron to enter into a new phase of modernization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-focus-on-modular-systems"&gt;A focus on modular systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, as they work to integrate AI, Bowman’s team is focusing heavily on modularity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pointed out that the initial ‘ask’ was search; they offered up a very simple use case allowing people to retrieve information that existed within a “very, very” complex SharePoint. But as users have engaged more and more, their asks are increasing; in response, his team has added a retrieval agent, an agent that can evaluate findings from a technical standpoint and an orchestrator agent to link the two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We really realized pretty early that we needed to lean in heavily on modularity, because we knew that these agents would be called upon in other workflows, based on the demand,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another effort is ‘Chevron Assist,’ a chat interface to operate on health, safety and environmental (HSE) standards. “We work in an enormously complex industry, and the stakes of the game are always higher,” said Bowman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tool provides a natural way for people to interact with documents related to critical standards and procedures, eliminating the need to click through links or search within documents. So, for instance, a user can combine all of the standards they need for a drilling crew, an operations crew and a maintenance crew.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We realized we weren’t thinking of the problem in the way that individual users are thinking of those things all together at once,” said Bowman. “There has been so much value in that integration. That’s really changed the way people do their work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-focusing-too-much-on-pocs"&gt;Not focusing too much on POCs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As it builds out its programs, Bowman’s team has actively avoided falling into the habit of undertaking pilots and proofs of concepts (POCs) that drag on too long. “There’s no value in that,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal has always been to deploy the most promising use cases into production, he said. Everything must be linked back to Chevron’s bottom line and offer up a strong value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know that with a curated data set and really enthusiastic, well-meaning group of users and a super narrowly defined use case, there’s almost 100% certainty that your POC will be successful,” said Bowman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another important element in deploying next-gen tools is overcoming the trust hurdle. From a behavior change standpoint, enterprise leaders must understand not only the expectations the company places on users locally and at the edge, but what those users expect in turn, said Bowman. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve built out these systems or tools in such a way that the individuals who are going to put hands on them don’t trust them, or can’t trust them, or there’s something holding them back, then you never really get the full enthusiastic deployment,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dawning age of agentic AI requires a total rethink on how we build software. Current enterprise APIs were built for human use; the APIs of the future will be multi-model, native interfaces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need to build the kind of APIs that will work well with agents, because agents are the ones that are now going to interact with APIs, not humans,” Merrin Kurien, principal engineer and AI platform architect at Intuit, said during the Women in AI breakfast at this year’s VB Transform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kurien had a dynamic discussion on the present and future of AI agents with fellow AI practitioners Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, engineering and product leader for storage and compute services at AWS, and Tiffany To, SVP of product for platform and enterprise at Atlassian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would like to think five years from now, agents will be mainstream,” said Kurien. “A lot of the challenges we face today probably will be overcome with better tooling, if the last two-and-a-half years is any indication. How prepared will you be? It’s dependent on your investments today.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-intuit-is-getting-invoices-paid-and-aws-is-supporting-faster-migration"&gt;How Intuit is getting invoices paid and AWS is supporting faster migration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Intuit has been using agents and seeing “amazing progress,” Kurien reported in the onstage panel, which was moderated by Betsy Peretti, partner for innovation and design at Bain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notably, the financial technology platform company has incorporated automated invoice generation and reminders into its&amp;nbsp;QuickBooks&amp;nbsp;offering, which is popular among small and medium businesses (SMBs).&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have seen businesses get paid on an average five days faster, and there’s 10% more likelihood that invoices get paid in full,” said Kurien.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AWS has also seen success with&amp;nbsp;AWS Transform, an agile infrastructure that migrates .NET, mainframe, and VMware workloads into AWS, said Tomsen Bukovec.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The traditional migration scenario, as she described it: A customer would go to the application owner and request to, for instance, move their Windows application to a Linux-based application running on AWS. “And guess what they would say? ‘Take a number. You are priority number 42.'”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But now, enterprises can do the majority of those migrations with AI assistance. “Your generalist teams are able to do way more work on their own, and it reduces the ask to the specialist,” said Tomsen Bukovec. “That is changing migration as an industry.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, how AWS and others evolve will be closely tied with how customers are using AI, she said. She marveled that incredible advancements in AI are “really making us take a new look, a hot take” on how to build applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we build agentic infrastructures and we incorporate AI into the mission of our businesses, we’re not just taking technology and putting it to work,” said Tomsen Bukovec. “We are actually changing the nature of the workplace, the workforce.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added, “We’re seeing this happen right now. We’re seeing this happen at warp speed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-atlassian-is-learning-from-experimentation-internally-and-with-customers-nbsp"&gt;How Atlassian is learning from experimentation internally and with customers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Atlassian is taking a thoughtful inside-out approach to AI agents, said To.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, the project management platform has launched an onboarding agent to help new employees access to all the materials they need to get started with their jobs. In the first month of launch, the agent fielded 7,000 requests. Now, it’s just a regular part of the onboarding process, To said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the company’s go-to-market team has numerous interface points with customers, which can make it challenging to gather all the necessary context. Atlassian built a customer agent that pulls all that data together, and To reported that it is one of its most popular agents, used by 80 teams across the company. “I use it quite a bit before I talk to customers,” she acknowledged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Atlassian, there is a strong responsibility to ‘dog food’ — using one’s own products and services — and iteratively experiment to help guide customers as they evolve with AI, To explained. That work can then be translated into what Atlassian ships to customers out of the box.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not only going to come from engineering; it’s going to come from across your entire organization,” she said. “So what can you do programmatically to bring the creativity of everyone cross-functionally, to bring ideas together, to design workflows?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company recently introduced its ‘Teamwork Collection,’ a curated selection of apps — Jira, Confluence and Loom — managed by ‘rovo agents.’ This is built into its platform and supports various aspects of the collaborative process. For instance, before a meeting, the agent will pull together a “really nice summary” based on Confluence pages and JIRA tickets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So when you go into that meeting, you now have all that shared context,” said To. “You’re not trying to update each other, you can actually spend time on important strategy decisions.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Atlassian estimates that that particular use case saves at least four hours per person per week. Customer HarperCollins, in particular, has used it to “great effect,” To noted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customers are using AI agents in varying complexities, she said: Sometimes they’re just offloading work, gathering data or writing release notes; other times they’re getting deep into raw data and pre-building strategic roadmaps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explained that Atlassian has built a graph layer on top of its data that provides deeper intelligence on how data is connected. For instance, enterprises can analyze their goals alongside team structuring and projects in progress. “It’s not just an HR org chart,” said To.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you think about how people build their software development lifecycles right now, a huge part of that is creating roadmaps and prioritizing strategies,” she said. “But that can be very dynamic, and taking into account all of that data is hard for humans to do. The agents we’re seeing become really popular now with customers are actually pre-building those strategic roadmaps.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To emphasized the importance of creating feedback loops with customers, noting that, in just the last three months, Atlassian users have customized 10,000 different versions of the company’s out-of-the-box agents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really great pool of feedback data that then helps us understand how they’re embedding these agents into their workflows,” said To. “I think part of what is really exciting about this wave is it’s such a collaborative process in designing with customers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-earning-trust-building-it-right-from-the-get-go"&gt;Earning trust, building it right from the get-go&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trust is the cornerstone of any product and that should be no different with AI, Kurien emphasized. Customers want to know what the agent is doing behind the scenes and have control over its actions. This requires stringent review processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With new waves came new vulnerabilities,” she said. “We have built a robust process where we are identifying the lifecycle in which an agent fits in and creating the right processes of reviews for that phase.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To underscored the fact that it’s more than raw technology; people must collaborate, build complete solutions together and tap into experience. The industry must invest in strong data architecture and have the right data context so that AI agents can make the powerful decisions we’ll be asking of them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Where it becomes really exciting is when it is a superpower in your organization, when it’s able to help you make better decisions, release better products, re-sort your goals, be more competitive as a company,” said To.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She noted that there have been many waves of innovation over the years, but this one with AI is one all its own. “I feel like with AI, it’s a tidal wave. It’s moment after moment after moment, right? AI is just completely different from all of the other waves.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: As a thank-you to our readers, we’ve opened up early bird registration for VB Transform 2026 — just $200.

AI is just completely different from all of the other waves.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: As a thank-you to our readers, we’ve opened up early bird registration for VB Transform 2026 — just $200.

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspiration can come from different places, even for architecting and designing agentic systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At VB Transform, Capital One explained how it built its agentic platform for its auto business. Milind Naphade, SVP of Technology and Head of AI Foundations at Capital One, said during VB Transform that the company wanted its agents to function similarly to human agents, in that they problem-solve alongside customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Naphade said Capital One began designing its agentic offerings 15 months ago, “before agentic became a buzzword.” For Capital One, it was crucial that, in building its agent systems, they learn from how their human agents ask customers for information to identify their problems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Capital One also looked to another source of organizational structure for its agents: itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We took inspiration from how Capital One itself functions,” Naphade said. “Within Capital One, as I’m sure within other financial services, you have to manage risk, and then there are other entities that you also observe, evaluate, question and audit.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;strong&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;See all our Transform 2025 coverage here&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/strong&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This same structure applies to agents that Capital One wants to monitor. They created an agent that evaluates existing agents, which was trained on Capital One’s policies and regulations. This evaluator agent can kick back the process if it detects a problem. Naphade said to think of it as “a team of experts where each of them has a different expertise and comes together to solve a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financial services organizations recognize the potential of agents to provide their human agents with information to resolve customer issues, manage customer service, and attract more people to their products. Other banks like BNY have deployed agents this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-auto-dealership-agents"&gt;Auto dealership agents&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Capital One deployed agents to its auto business to assist the bank’s dealership clients in helping their customers find the right car and car loan. Consumers can look at the vehicle inventories of dealerships that are ready for test drives. Naphade said their dealership customers reported a 55% improvement in metrics such as engagement and serious sales leads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re able to generate much better serious leads through this more conversational, natural conversation,” he said. “They can have 24/7 agents working, and if the car breaks down at midnight, the chat is there for you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Naphade said Capital One would love to bring this type of agent to its travel business, especially for its customer-facing engagements. Capital One, which opened a new lounge in New York’s JFK Airport, offers a very popular credit card for travel points. However, Naphade pointed out that the bank needs to conduct extensive internal testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-data-and-models-for-bank-agents"&gt;Data and models for bank agents&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like many enterprises, Capital One has a lot of data for its AI systems, but it has to figure out the best way to bring that context to its agents. It also has to experiment with the best model architecture for its agents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Naphade and Capital One’s team of applied researchers, engineers and data scientists used methods like model distillation for more efficient architectures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The understanding agent is the bulk of our cost because that’s the one that has to disambiguate,” he said. “It’s a bigger model, so we try to distribute it down and get a lot of bang for our buck. Then there’s also multi-token prediction and aggregated pre-fill, a lot of interesting ways we can optimize this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of data, Naphade said his team had undergone several “iterations of experimentation, testing, evaluation, human in the loop and all the right guardrails” before releasing its AI applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But one of the biggest challenges we faced was that we didn’t have any precedents. We couldn’t go and say, oh somebody else did it this way, so we couldn’t ask how it worked out for them?” Naphade said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
