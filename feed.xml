Designed to be adaptable to a variety of models and cloud hosts, the system employs a range of optimizations to get more inference power out of the same hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a variety of different types of optimizations, all the way down to CUDA kernels to advanced speculative decoding techniques,” said CEO Matthew Zeiler. “You can get more out of the same cards, basically.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The results were verified by a string of benchmark tests by the third-party firm Artificial Analysis, which recorded industry-best records for both throughput and latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The process focuses specifically on inference, the computing demands of operating an AI model that has already been trained. That computing load has grown particularly intense with the rise of agentic and reasoning models, which require multiple steps in response to a single command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First launched as a computer vision service, Clarifai has grown increasingly focused on compute orchestration as the AI boom has drastically increased demand for both GPUs and the data centers that house them. The company first announced its compute platform at AWS re:Invent in December, but the new reasoning engine is the first product specifically tailored for multi-step agentic models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The product comes amid intense pressure on AI infrastructure, which has spurred a string of billion-dollar deals. OpenAI has laid out plans for as much as $1 trillion in new data center spending, projecting nearly limitless future demand for compute. But while the hardware buildout has been intense, Clarifai’s CEO believes there is more to be done in optimizing the infrastructure we already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There’s software tricks that take a good model like this further, like the Clarifai reasoning engine,” Zeiler says, “but there’s also algorithm improvements that can help combat the need for gigawatt data centers. And I don’t think we’re at the end of the algorithm innovations.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1862779720.jpg?resize=1200,738" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Thursday, the AI platform Clarifai announced a new reasoning engine that it claims will make running AI models twice as fast and 40% less expensive.

            &lt;p&gt;Machine-learning models can speed up the discovery of new materials by making predictions and suggesting experiments. But most models today only consider a few specific types of data or variables. Compare that with human scientists, who work in a collaborative environment and consider experimental results, the broader scientific literature, imaging and structural analysis, personal experience or intuition, and input from colleagues and peer reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT researchers have developed a method for optimizing materials recipes and planning experiments that incorporates information from diverse sources like insights from the literature, chemical compositions, microstructural images, and more. The approach is part of a new platform, named Copilot for Real-world Experimental Scientists (CRESt), that also uses robotic equipment for high-throughput materials testing, the results of which are fed back into large multimodal models to further optimize materials recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human researchers can converse with the system in natural language, with no coding required, and the system makes its own observations and hypotheses along the way. Cameras and visual language models also allow the system to monitor experiments, detect issues, and suggest corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the field of AI for science, the key is designing new experiments,” says Ju Li, School of Engineering Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. “We use multimodal feedback — for example information from previous literature on how palladium behaved in fuel cells at this temperature, and human feedback — to complement experimental data and design new experiments. We also use robots to synthesize and characterize the material’s structure and to test performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is described in a paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers used CRESt to explore more than 900 chemistries and conduct 3,500 electrochemical tests, leading to the discovery of a catalyst material that delivered record power density in a fuel cell that runs on formate salt to produce electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining Li on the paper as first authors are&amp;nbsp;PhD student Zhen Zhang, Zhichu Ren PhD ’24, PhD student Chia-Wei Hsu, and postdoc&amp;nbsp;Weibin Chen.

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A smarter system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials science experiments can be time-consuming and expensive. They require researchers to carefully design workflows, make new material, and run a series of tests and analysis to understand what happened. Those results are then used to decide how to improve the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve the process, some researchers have turned to a machine-learning strategy known as active learning to make efficient use of previous experimental data points and explore or exploit those data. When paired with a statistical technique known as Bayesian optimization (BO), active learning has helped researchers identify new materials for things like batteries and advanced semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bayesian optimization is like Netflix recommending the next movie to watch based on your viewing history, except instead it recommends the next experiment to do,” Li explains. “But basic Bayesian optimization is too simplistic. It uses a boxed-in design space, so if I say I’m going to use platinum, palladium, and iron, it only changes the ratio of those elements in this small space. But real materials have a lot more dependencies, and BO often gets lost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most active learning approaches also rely on single data streams that don’t capture everything that goes on in an experiment. To equip computational systems with more human-like knowledge, while still taking advantage of the speed and control of automated systems, Li and his collaborators built CRESt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRESt’s robotic equipment includes a liquid-handling robot, a carbothermal shock system to rapidly synthesize materials, an automated electrochemical workstation for testing, characterization equipment including automated electron microscopy and optical microscopy, and auxiliary devices such as pumps and gas valves, which can also be remotely controlled.&amp;nbsp; Many processing parameters can also be tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the user interface, researchers can chat with CRESt and tell it to use active learning to find promising materials recipes for different projects. CRESt can include up to 20 precursor molecules and substrates into its recipe. To guide material designs, CRESt’s models search through scientific papers for descriptions of elements or precursor molecules that might be useful. When human researchers tell CRESt to pursue new recipes, it kicks off a robotic symphony of sample preparation, characterization, and testing. The researcher can also ask CRESt to perform image analysis from scanning electron microscopy imaging, X-ray diffraction, and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information from those processes is used to train the active learning models, which use both literature knowledge and current experimental results to suggest further experiments and accelerate materials discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For each recipe we use previous literature text or databases, and it creates these huge representations of every recipe based on the previous knowledge base before even doing the experiment,” says Li. “We perform principal component analysis in this knowledge embedding space to get a reduced search space that captures most of the performance variability. Then we use Bayesian optimization in this reduced space to design the new experiment. After the new experiment, we feed newly acquired multimodal experimental data and human feedback into a large language model to augment the knowledgebase and redefine the reduced search space, which gives us a big boost in active learning efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials science experiments can also face reproducibility challenges. To address the problem, CRESt monitors its experiments with cameras, looking for potential problems and suggesting solutions via text and voice to human researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used CRESt to develop an electrode material for an advanced type of high-density fuel cell known as a direct formate fuel cell. After exploring more than 900 chemistries over three months, CRESt discovered a catalyst material made from eight elements that achieved a 9.3-fold improvement in power density per dollar over pure palladium, an expensive precious metal. In further tests, CRESTs material was used to deliver a record power density to a working direct formate fuel cell even though the cell contained just one-fourth of the precious metals of previous devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show the potential for CRESt to find solutions to real-world energy problems that have plagued the materials science and engineering community for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A significant challenge for fuel-cell catalysts is the use of precious metal,” says Zhang. “For fuel cells, researchers have used various precious metals like palladium and platinum. We used a multielement catalyst that also incorporates many other cheap elements to create the optimal coordination environment for catalytic activity and resistance to poisoning species such as carbon monoxide and adsorbed hydrogen atom. People have been searching low-cost options for many years. This system greatly accelerated our search for these catalysts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A helpful assistant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on, poor reproducibility emerged as a major problem that limited the researchers’ ability to perform their new active learning technique on experimental datasets. Material properties can be influenced by the way the precursors are mixed and processed, and any number of problems can subtly alter experimental conditions, requiring careful inspection to correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To partially automate the process, the researchers coupled computer vision and vision language models with domain knowledge from the scientific literature, which allowed the system to hypothesize sources of irreproducibility and propose solutions. For example, the models can notice when there’s a millimeter-sized deviation in a sample’s shape or when a pipette moves something out of place. The researchers incorporated some of the model’s suggestions, leading to improved consistency, suggesting the models already make good experimental assistants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that humans still performed most of the debugging in their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CREST is an assistant, not a replacement, for human researchers,” Li says. “Human researchers are still indispensable. In fact, we use natural language so the system can explain what it is doing and present observations and hypotheses. But this is a step toward more flexible, self-driving labs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;From dating apps and AI-powered matchmaking to full-on digital companionship, artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming a third party in our most personal relationships. But is it truly helping us find deeper connection — or just reshaping romance into an algorithmic illusion?&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Only on the &lt;strong&gt;AI Stage&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;TechCrunch Disrupt 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, happening October 27-29 in San Francisco’s Moscone West, we’re bringing together three powerhouse voices to unpack the future of love, trust, and tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eugenia Kuyda&lt;/strong&gt;, founder of Replika, the world’s leading AI companion platform with over 35 million users. Her mission: build AI that supports human emotional well-being — not replaces it.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Kantor&lt;/strong&gt;, head of product at Tinder and former GM at Zynga. He’s seen how features can drive feelings — and how behavioral design shapes who we match, message, and meet.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Amanda Gesselman&lt;/strong&gt;, Kinsey Institute research scientist, whose work explores how digital intimacy, platforms, and emotional outsourcing are redefining relationships in the AI era.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-this-session-we-ll-dive-into"&gt;In this session, we’ll dive into:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;How recommendation engines shape who we date and why.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;The psychological impact of digital companionship and AI “love.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;What’s being lost — or gained — when intimacy is optimized.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Ethical red flags and design choices that deserve more scrutiny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Generative AI systems that create text, images, audio, and even video are becoming commonplace. In the same way AI models output those data types, they can also be used to output robot actions. That's the foundation of Google DeepMind's Gemini Robotics project, which has announced a pair of new models that work together to create the first robots that "think" before acting. Traditional LLMs have their own set of problems, but the introduction of simulated reasoning did significantly upgrade their capabilities, and now the same could be happening with AI robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team at DeepMind contends that generative AI is a uniquely important technology for robotics because it unlocks general functionality. Current robots have to be trained intensively on specific tasks, and they are typically bad at doing anything else. "Robots today are highly bespoke and difficult to deploy, often taking many months in order to install a single cell that can do a single task," said Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamentals of generative systems make AI-powered robots more general. They can be presented with entirely new situations and workspaces without needing to be reprogrammed. DeepMind's current approach to robotics relies on two models: one that thinks and one that does.&lt;/p&gt;

      Gemini Robotics 1.5: Learning Across Embodiments

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two new models are known as Gemini Robotics 1.5 and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5. The former is a vision-language-action (VLA) model, meaning it uses visual and text data to generate robot actions. The "ER" in the other model stands for embodied reasoning. This is a vision-language model (VLM) that takes visual and text input to generate the steps needed to complete a complex task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The thinking machines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is the first robotics AI capable of simulated reasoning like modern text-based chatbots—Google likes to call this "thinking," but that's a bit of a misnomer in the realm of generative AI. DeepMind says the ER model achieves top marks in both academic and internal benchmarks, which shows that it can make accurate decisions about how to interact with a physical space. It doesn't undertake any actions, though. That's where Gemini Robotics 1.5 comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 would process the request along with images of the physical environment (a pile of clothing). This AI can also call tools like Google search to gather more data. The ER model then generates natural language instructions, specific steps that the robot should follow to complete the given task.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini Robotics 1.5 (the action model) takes these instructions from the ER model and generates robot actions while using visual input to guide its movements. But it also goes through its own thinking process to consider how to approach each step. "There are all these kinds of intuitive thoughts that help [a person] guide this task, but robots don't have this intuition," said DeepMind's Kanishka Rao. "One of the major advancements that we've made with 1.5 in the VLA is its ability to think before it acts."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of DeepMind's new robotic AIs are built on the Gemini foundation models but have been fine-tuned with data that adapts them to operating in a physical space. This approach, the team says, gives robots the ability to undertake more complex multi-stage tasks, bringing agentic capabilities to robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DeepMind team tests Gemini robotics with a few different machines, like the two-armed Aloha 2 and the humanoid Apollo. In the past, AI researchers had to create customized models for each robot, but that's no longer necessary. DeepMind says that Gemini Robotics 1.5 can learn across different embodiments, transferring skills learned from Aloha 2's grippers to the more intricate hands on Apollo with no specialized tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this talk of physical agents powered by AI is fun, but we're still a long way from a robot you can order to do your laundry. Gemini Robotics 1.5, the model that actually controls robots, is still only available to trusted testers. However, the thinking ER model is now rolling out in Google AI Studio, allowing developers to generate robotic instructions for their own physically embodied robotic experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The price point is either part of a running joke Musk has of using variations of 420, a marijuana reference, or a nod to one of Musk’s favorite books, “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” which references the number 42 as the answer to the meaning of life and the universe. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this year, xAI had been close to being approved as a GSA vendor, but after Grok began generating antisemitic posts and calling itself “MechaHitler” on X, the planned partnership reportedly fell through. In late August, internal emails obtained by Wired revealed the White House had instructed the GSA to add xAI’s Grok to the approved vendor list “ASAP.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company was also one of several AI firms, including Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, to be selected for a $200 million contract with the Pentagon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Musk formed and led the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in a rampant cost-cutting spree that has seen mixed results. During that time, Musk placed several aides at the GSA and other government agencies responsible for regulating or awarding government contracts in industries in which Musk has business.&lt;/p&gt;

The test, GDPval, is an early attempt at understanding how close OpenAI’s systems are to outperforming humans at economically valuable work — a key part of the company’s founding mission to develop artificial general intelligence, or AGI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says its found that its GPT-5 model and Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1 “are already approaching the quality of work produced by industry experts.” &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s not to say that OpenAI’s models are going to start replacing humans in their jobs immediately. Despite predictions by some CEOs that AI will take the jobs of humans in just a few years, OpenAI admits that GDPval today covers a very limited number of tasks people do in their real jobs. However, it is one of the latest ways the company is measuring AI’s progress toward this milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GDPval is based on nine industries that contribute the most to America’s gross domestic product, including domains such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and government. The benchmark tests an AI model’s performance in 44 occupations among those industries, ranging from software engineers to nurses to journalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For OpenAI’s first version of the test, GDPval-v0, OpenAI asked experienced professionals to compare AI-generated reports with those produced by other professionals, and then choose the best one. For example, one prompt asked investment bankers to create a competitor landscape for the last-mile delivery industry and compare them to AI-generated reports. OpenAI then averages an AI model’s “win rate” against the human reports across all 44 occupations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For GPT-5-high, a souped-up version of GPT-5 with extra computational power, the company says the AI model was ranked as better than or on par with industry experts 40.6% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also tested Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1 model, which was ranked as better than or on par with industry experts in 49% of tasks. OpenAI says that it believes Claude scored so high because of its tendency to make pleasing graphics, rather than sheer performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s worth noting that most working professionals do a lot more than submit research reports to their boss, which is all that GDPval-v0 tests for. OpenAI acknowledges this and says it plans to create more robust tests in the future that can account for more industries and interactive workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nonetheless, the company sees the progress on GDPval as notable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an interview with TechCrunch, OpenAI’s chief economist Dr. Aaron Chatterji said GDPval’s results suggest that people in these jobs can now use AI models to spend time on more meaningful tasks.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“[Because] the model is getting good at some of these things,” Chatterji says, “people in those jobs can now use the model, increasingly as capabilities get better, to offload some of their work and do potentially higher value things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s evaluations lead Tejal Patwardhan tells TechCrunch that she’s encouraged by the rate of progress on GDPval. OpenAI’s GPT-4o model scored just 13.7% (wins and ties versus humans), which was released roughly 15 months ago. Now GPT-5 scores nearly triple that, a trend Patwardhan expects to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Silicon Valley has a wide range of benchmarks it uses to measure the progress of AI models and assess whether a given model is state-of-the-art. Among the most popular are AIME 2025 (a test of competitive math problems) and GPQA Diamond (a test of PhD-level science questions). However, several AI models are nearing saturation on some of these benchmarks, and many AI researchers have cited the need for better tests that can measure AI’s proficiency on real-world tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Benchmarks like GDPval could become increasingly important in that conversation, as OpenAI makes the case that its AI models are valuable for a wide range of industries.

Orders arrive through different channels, staff spend hours manually entering them into clunky enterprise software systems, and compliance often depends on spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For decades, software vendors have tried, with mixed success, to modernize the workflows behind the global movement of perishable goods.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, a Y Combinator startup called Burnt thinks AI agents — software that can automatically handle tasks typically done by humans — can succeed where traditional enterprise software hasn’t in the trillion-dollar U.S. food market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company, which automates back-office supply chain tasks with AI, has raised $3.8 million in seed funding led by Penny Jar Capital, the venture firm backed by NBA star Steph Curry, with participation from Scribble Ventures, Formation VC, and angel investors, including Dan Scheinman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Burnt co-founder and CEO Joseph Jacob grew up around food factories. He says his great-grandfather was the first to export shrimp from India to the U.S. in the 1930s. Since then, each generation of his family has worked somewhere along the seafood supply chain, including farming, processing, exporting, and importing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jacob moved to India during his formative years and, after college, worked on the factory floor of a shrimp processor in a rural area. The experience introduced him to the intricacies of the food and restaurant business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When he returned to the U.S. and began managing large volumes of seafood imports, he noticed major inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I ended up buying hundreds of millions of pounds of seafood, but everything was tracked on Excel sheets and a 20-year-old ERP system,” Jacob told TechCrunch. “In a business with razor-thin margins, it’s nearly impossible to succeed without good supply chain management. We went through multiple software implementations, but two rollouts failed. That’s when I realized I wanted to build software for this industry, not just work in it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jacob’s experience isn’t an isolated one. Enterprise vendors have long tried to sell distributors on large rollouts that drag on for years, cost millions, and frustrate the small and mid-sized players that dominate the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After two decades of missed software adoption in the industry, Jacob believes&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Burnt’s approach of layering AI agents on top of existing systems rather than replacing them represents a massive opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Everyone we talk to calls their ERP a necessary evil,” said the chief executive. “Traditional software forced teams to rip out old processes and adopt new ones. With AI, you don’t need to change the process; you just get the work done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s how things tend to work today: Sales reps at food distributors receive orders via email, phone calls, WhatsApp, voicemails, texts, and even faxes. Each order then has to be keyed in manually. While critical, the process eats up hours that could be spent on higher-value work like winning new customers or upselling existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Burnt’s first agent, Ozai, automates and manages this order-entry process. In fact, Jacob claims it can handle up to 80% of workflows that are currently stuck in legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since launching in January, the startup has processed more than $10 million in monthly orders across seafood, specialty goods, and packaged food distributors. One of the U.K.’s largest food conglomerates, with billions in revenue, is currently implementing Burnt’s system. The company is already generating six-figure revenue and growing “steadily” month-on-month, though Jacob declined to share exact numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While building AI for food supply chains may sound unglamorous, Jacob says that’s the point. He argues that decades of failed tech rollouts have left operators skeptical of “tech tourists” with no industry experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;His background, as well as that of his co-founders, has helped Burnt gain trust in a sector where relationships matter. Chief Product Officer Rhea Karimpanal — Jacob’s childhood friend and now wife — comes from a family that ran restaurants, while CTO Chandru Shanmugasundaram built software systems for restaurant applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jacob previously worked at Rekki, a Benchmark-backed B2B marketplace for restaurants and suppliers, where he saw firsthand how brittle supply chain tech could be and how AI might transform it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, winning investors wasn’t straightforward. AI agents may be hot, but convincing VCs to back one for food distributors required a different pitch. Many lacked conviction in the market despite its size, he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s where Curry’s Penny Jar Capital came in. The firm’s thesis is centered on backing founders who are building in “overlooked” industries where tech adoption lags.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Two decades of missed software adoption is a massive opportunity. Investors who understand this know it can be huge if executed right,” Jacob said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/7a2af4da-c373-4aff-8bd5-3f7a68ac26d8_4b1d70.jpeg?w=720" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Food supply chains are notoriously messy.

One of the U.K.’s largest food conglomerates, with billions in revenue, is currently implementing Burnt’s system. The company is already generating six-figure revenue and growing “steadily” month-on-month, though Jacob declined to share exact numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While building AI for food supply chains may sound unglamorous, Jacob says that’s the point. He argues that decades of failed tech rollouts have left operators skeptical of “tech tourists” with no industry experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;His background, as well as that of his co-founders, has helped Burnt gain trust in a sector where relationships matter. Chief Product Officer Rhea Karimpanal — Jacob’s childhood friend and now wife — comes from a family that ran restaurants, while CTO Chandru Shanmugasundaram built software systems for restaurant applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jacob previously worked at Rekki, a Benchmark-backed B2B marketplace for restaurants and suppliers, where he saw firsthand how brittle supply chain tech could be and how AI might transform it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, winning investors wasn’t straightforward. AI agents may be hot, but convincing VCs to back one for food distributors required a different pitch. Many lacked conviction in the market despite its size, he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s where Curry’s Penny Jar Capital came in. The firm’s thesis is centered on backing founders who are building in “overlooked” industries where tech adoption lags.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Two decades of missed software adoption is a massive opportunity. Investors who understand this know it can be huge if executed right,” Jacob said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/steph-currys-vc-firm-just-backed-an-ai-startup-that-wants-to-fix-food-supply-chains/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 16:30:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Juicebox raises $30M from Sequoia to revolutionize hiring with LLM-powered search (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/juicebox-raises-30m-from-sequoia-to-revolutionize-hiring-with-llm-powered-search/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/david_and_ishan.jpg?resize=1200,857" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;For years, recruiters used machine learning to find potential hires by searching for keywords in résumés and LinkedIn profiles. Although this method helps to narrow the candidate pool, recruiters still have to manually review each profile to determine the best fit for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;David Paffenholz (pictured left) and Ishan Gupta, then just 22 and 19, respectively, realized that LLMs could find talent faster and more efficiently. They built Juicebox, an AI-powered search engine that uses natural language to analyze professional profiles, personal websites, and other publicly available information to identify the most qualified candidates.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After attending startup accelerator Y Combinator in the summer of 2022, Paffenholz and Gupta spent a couple more years refining their product. When their AI search engine, PeopleGPT, was ready in late 2023, it was quickly adopted by a wide range of customers, from small startups to large companies like Cognition, Ramp, and Perplexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a short period of time, it was serving over 2,500 customers and achieving more than $10 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Thursday, Juicebox announced that it had raised $36 million in total funding, including a $30 million Series A round led by Sequoia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sequoia partner David Cahn learned about the company while catching up with an early-stage startup founder who said that he is using Juicebox for all of his recruiting efforts. Cahn told TechCrunch that the founder has hired over a dozen people without using a professional recruiter, something that was previously very difficult to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Such a rave review of Juicebox piqued Cahn’s interest. Shortly after, Cahn learned that Sequoia’s internal recruiter was also trying Juicebox to help the firm with its own hiring efforts, which made him even more excited about the startup’s growth potential. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When Cahn eventually met with Paffenholz and Gupta, he was even more impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m not sure I’ve ever in my career seen a company with four people that got to 2,000 customers with that small of a team,” Cahn told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Juicebox has since hired eight additional employees, the company continues to attract customers without a sales team.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Customers are flocking to Juicebox in part because hiring speed is extremely important for companies racing to build AI functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What sets Juicebox’s search engine apart is its ability to infer information about candidates much like a human would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We help find net new candidates that wouldn’t be found elsewhere, because the profiles might not have the keywords or the types of things that we’d expect them to have in the regular searches,” Paffenholz told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup’s product is popular not only with small companies that lack a dedicated recruiter, but also with talent teams at large corporations. By automating the candidate search, the tool frees up internal recruiters to focus more on building relationships with potential hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once Juicebox identifies candidates, its agent can automatically email them and schedule initial calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Juicebox is growing quickly, older talent acquisition startups like Eightfold are also adding AI-powered search functionality to their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, Cahn is convinced that Paffenholz and Gupta can transform Juicebox into an essential product for every startup’s technology stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve invested in a number of businesses that become defaults for startups, like Stripe,” he said. “I think Juicebox has a chance to be a default where, every single startup, [it’s] the first thing they use to hire their first employees.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/david_and_ishan.jpg?resize=1200,857" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;For years, recruiters used machine learning to find potential hires by searching for keywords in résumés and LinkedIn profiles.

Pulse offers users five to 10 briefs that can get them up to speed on their day and is aimed at encouraging users to check ChatGPT first thing in the morning — much like they would check social media or a news app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pulse is part of a broader shift in OpenAI’s consumer products, which are lately being designed to work for users asynchronously instead of responding to questions. Features like ChatGPT Agent or Codex aim to make ChatGPT feel more like an assistant rather than a chatbot. With Pulse, OpenAI seemingly wants ChatGPT to be more proactive.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re building AI that lets us take the level of support that only the wealthiest have been able to afford and make it available to everyone over time,” said OpenAI’s new CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, in a blog post. “And ChatGPT Pulse is the first step in that direction — starting with Pro users today, but with the goal of rolling out this intelligence to all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this week that some of ChatGPT’s new “compute-intensive” products would be limited to the company’s most expensive subscription plan — which is the case for Pulse. OpenAI has previously said it’s severely limited in the number of servers it has to power ChatGPT, and it’s rapidly building out AI data centers with partners like Oracle and SoftBank to increase its capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Starting Thursday, OpenAI will roll out Pulse for subscribers to its $200-a-month Pro plan, for whom it will appear as a new tab in the ChatGPT app. The company says it would like to launch Pulse to all ChatGPT users in the future, with Plus subscribers to get access soon, but it first needs to make the product more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pulse’s reports can be roundups of news articles on a specific topic — like updates on a specific sports team — as well as more personalized briefs based on a user’s context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a demo for TechCrunch, OpenAI product lead Adam Fry showed several reports Pulse had made for him: a roundup of news about British soccer team Arsenal; group Halloween costume suggestions for his wife and kids; and a toddler-friendly travel itinerary for his family’s upcoming trip to Sedona, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050481" height="200" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;An example of Pulse’s cards and reports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Each report is displayed as a “card” featuring AI-generated images and text. Users can click on each one to get the full report and can then query ChatGPT about the contents. Pulse will proactively generate some reports, but users can also ask Pulse for new automated reports or offer feedback on existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A core part of Pulse is that it stops after generating a few reports and shows a message: “Great, that’s it for today.” According to Fry, that’s an intentional design choice to make the service different from engagement-optimized social media apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pulse is compatible with ChatGPT’s Connectors, so users can connect apps like Google Calendar and Gmail. Once that’s set up, Pulse will parse through your email overnight to surface the most important messages in the morning, or access your calendar to generate an agenda for upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If users have ChatGPT’s memory features turned on, Pulse will also pull in context from previous chats to improve your reports. OpenAI’s personalization lead, Christina Wadsworth Kaplan, gave an example of how Pulse automatically picked up on her love of running to create an itinerary for her upcoming trip to London that included running routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wadsworth Kaplan described Pulse as a “net-new functionality” for a consumer product. As a pescatarian, she says Pulse takes dinner reservations on her calendar and finds menu items that work with her diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But it’s hard to overlook how Pulse could compete with existing news products, such as Apple News, paid newsletters, or traditional journalism outlets. Fry doesn’t expect Pulse to replace the various news apps people use, and the feature cites its sources with links in the same way ChatGPT Search does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It remains to be seen if Pulse is worth the computational power it requires to work. Fry says the service can “vary tremendously” in how much computing power it spends on a given task — for some projects, it’s fairly efficient, but others may require searching the web and synthesizing lots of documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eventually, OpenAI would like to make Pulse more agentic, to the point where it could make restaurant reservations on a user’s behalf, or draft emails that users could approve to be sent. But such features may be a long way out and would likely require OpenAI’s agentic models to improve a great deal before users would trust it with such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI is launching a new feature inside of ChatGPT called Pulse, which generates personalized reports for users while they sleep.

If the company has a waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly beyond visual line of sight (these are becoming easier to get), its security team can fly the drones within a certain radius, often a few miles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Instead of a 911 call [that triggers the drone], it’s an alarm call,” says Keith Kauffman, a former police chief who now directs Flock’s drone program. “It’s still the same type of response.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kauffman walked through how the drone program might work in the case of retail theft: If the security team at a store like Home Depot, for example, saw shoplifters leave the store, then the drone, equipped with cameras, could be activated from its docking station on the roof.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The drone follows the people. The people get in a car. You click a button,” he says, “and you track the vehicle with the drone, and the drone just follows the car.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The video feed of that drone might go to the company’s security team, but it could also be automatically transmitted directly to police departments.&lt;/p&gt;

If the company has a waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly beyond visual line of sight (these are becoming easier to get), its security team can fly the drones within a certain radius, often a few miles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Instead of a 911 call [that triggers the drone], it’s an alarm call,” says Keith Kauffman, a former police chief who now directs Flock’s drone program. “It’s still the same type of response.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kauffman walked through how the drone program might work in the case of retail theft: If the security team at a store like Home Depot, for example, saw shoplifters leave the store, then the drone, equipped with cameras, could be activated from its docking station on the roof.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The drone follows the people. The people get in a car. You click a button,” he says, “and you track the vehicle with the drone, and the drone just follows the car.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The video feed of that drone might go to the company’s security team, but it could also be automatically transmitted directly to police departments.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;With AI chatbots growing in popular usage, it was only a matter of time before large numbers of people began applying them to the stock market. In fact, at least 1 in 10 retail investors now consult ChatGPT or other AI chatbots for stock-picking advice, according to a Reuters report published Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from a survey by trading platform eToro of 11,000 retail investors worldwide suggests that 13 percent of individual investors already use AI tools like ChatGPT or Google's Gemini for stock selection, while about half say they would consider using these tools for portfolio decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike algorithmic trading, where computers automatically execute thousands of trades per second, investors are using ChatGPT as an advisory tool in place of human experts. They type questions, read the AI model's analysis, and then manually decide whether to place trades through their brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters spoke with Jeremy Leung, who analyzed companies for investment bank UBS for almost two decades. Leung now relies on ChatGPT for his multi-asset portfolio. "I no longer have the luxury of a Bloomberg terminal, or those kinds of market-data services which are very, very expensive," Leung told Reuters. "Even the simple ChatGPT tool can do a lot and replicate a lot of the workflows that I used to do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reports that financial products comparison website Finder asked ChatGPT in March 2023 to select stocks from high-quality businesses based on criteria like debt levels and sustained growth. Since then, the resulting 38-stock portfolio has reportedly grown in value nearly 55 percent. That performance beat the average of the UK's 10 most popular funds by almost 19 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a huge caveat to that kind of AI success story: US stocks sit near record highs, Reuters notes, with the S&amp;amp;P 500 index up 13 percent this year after surging 23 percent last year. Those are conditions that can make almost any stock-picking strategy look smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters frames the AI trading advice trend as a case of new technology tools "democratizing," or opening up, investment analysis once reserved for institutional investors with expensive data terminals. But experts warn that AI models can confabulate financial data and lack access to real-time market information, making them risky substitutes for professional advice.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;"AI models can be brilliant," Dan Moczulski, UK managing director at eToro, told Reuters. "The risk comes when people treat generic models like ChatGPT or Gemini as crystal balls." He noted that general AI models "can misquote figures and dates, lean too hard on a pre-established narrative, and overly rely on past price action to attempt to predict the future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The hazards of AI stock picking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using AI to trade stocks at home feels like it might be the next step in a long series of technological advances that have democratized individual retail investing, for better or for worse. Computer-based stock trading for individuals dates back to 1984, when Charles Schwab introduced electronic trading services for dial-up customers. E-Trade launched in 1992, and by the late 1990s, online brokerages had transformed retail investing, dropping commission fees from hundreds of dollars per trade to under $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first "robo-advisors" appeared after the 2008 financial crisis, which began the rise of automated online services that use algorithms to manage and rebalance portfolios based on a client's goals. Services like Betterment launched in 2010, and Wealthfront followed in 2011, using algorithms to automatically rebalance portfolios. By the end of 2015, robo-advisors from nearly 100 companies globally were managing $60 billion in client assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of ChatGPT in November 2022 arguably marked a new phase where retail investors could directly query an AI model for stock picks rather than relying on pre-programmed algorithms. But Leung acknowledged that ChatGPT cannot access data behind paywalls, potentially missing crucial analyses available through professional services. To get better results, he creates specific prompts like "assume you're a short analyst, what is the short thesis for this stock?" or "use only credible sources, such as SEC filings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond chatbots, reliance on financial algorithms is growing. The "robo-advisory" market, which includes all companies providing automated, algorithm-driven financial advice from fintech startups to established banks, is forecast to grow roughly 600 percent by 2029, according to data-analysis firm Research and Markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as more retail investors turn to AI tools for investment decisions,&amp;nbsp;it's also potential trouble waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If people get comfortable investing using AI and they're making money, they may not be able to manage in a crisis or downturn," Leung warned Reuters. The concern extends beyond individual losses to whether retail investors using AI tools understand risk management or have strategies for when markets turn bearish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's a huge caveat to that kind of AI success story: US stocks sit near record highs, Reuters notes, with the S&amp;amp;P 500 index up 13 percent this year after surging 23 percent last year. Those are conditions that can make almost any stock-picking strategy look smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters frames the AI trading advice trend as a case of new technology tools "democratizing," or opening up, investment analysis once reserved for institutional investors with expensive data terminals. But experts warn that AI models can confabulate financial data and lack access to real-time market information, making them risky substitutes for professional advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"AI models can be brilliant," Dan Moczulski, UK managing director at eToro, told Reuters. "The risk comes when people treat generic models like ChatGPT or Gemini as crystal balls." He noted that general AI models "can misquote figures and dates, lean too hard on a pre-established narrative, and overly rely on past price action to attempt to predict the future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The hazards of AI stock picking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using AI to trade stocks at home feels like it might be the next step in a long series of technological advances that have democratized individual retail investing, for better or for worse. Computer-based stock trading for individuals dates back to 1984, when Charles Schwab introduced electronic trading services for dial-up customers. E-Trade launched in 1992, and by the late 1990s, online brokerages had transformed retail investing, dropping commission fees from hundreds of dollars per trade to under $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first "robo-advisors" appeared after the 2008 financial crisis, which began the rise of automated online services that use algorithms to manage and rebalance portfolios based on a client's goals. Services like Betterment launched in 2010, and Wealthfront followed in 2011, using algorithms to automatically rebalance portfolios. By the end of 2015, robo-advisors from nearly 100 companies globally were managing $60 billion in client assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of ChatGPT in November 2022 arguably marked a new phase where retail investors could directly query an AI model for stock picks rather than relying on pre-programmed algorithms. But Leung acknowledged that ChatGPT cannot access data behind paywalls, potentially missing crucial analyses available through professional services. To get better results, he creates specific prompts like "assume you're a short analyst, what is the short thesis for this stock?" or "use only credible sources, such as SEC filings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond chatbots, reliance on financial algorithms is growing. The "robo-advisory" market, which includes all companies providing automated, algorithm-driven financial advice from fintech startups to established banks, is forecast to grow roughly 600 percent by 2029, according to data-analysis firm Research and Markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as more retail investors turn to AI tools for investment decisions,&amp;nbsp;it's also potential trouble waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If people get comfortable investing using AI and they're making money, they may not be able to manage in a crisis or downturn," Leung warned Reuters. The concern extends beyond individual losses to whether retail investors using AI tools understand risk management or have strategies for when markets turn bearish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech giant announced on Thursday that it&amp;nbsp;made the decision to “cease and disable”&amp;nbsp;certain subscriptions from the Israeli military.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We do not provide technology to&amp;nbsp;facilitate&amp;nbsp;mass surveillance of civilians,” Microsoft vice chair and&amp;nbsp;president&amp;nbsp;Brad Smith wrote in a&amp;nbsp;blog post. “We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades. This is why we explained publicly on August 15 that Microsoft’s standard terms of service prohibit the use of our technology for mass surveillance of civilians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft informed Israel of its decision last week, according to&amp;nbsp;The Guardian.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The decision follows Microsoft’s&amp;nbsp;ongoing&amp;nbsp;review&amp;nbsp;of the matter,&amp;nbsp;which started in August. The investigation&amp;nbsp;was sparked by a story in&amp;nbsp;The Guardian&amp;nbsp;that reported that Unit 8200, the elite Israel military intelligence unit, was&amp;nbsp;using Azure cloud storage to&amp;nbsp;house&amp;nbsp;data on phone calls&amp;nbsp;obtained through the surveillance of&amp;nbsp;Palestinians&amp;nbsp;in Gaza and the West Bank.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Pulse, a new "push" feature that generates personalized daily updates for users without having to ask each time. The preview feature, available now for Pro subscribers on mobile, marks OpenAI's latest attempt to make ChatGPT proactive rather than reactive, with the AI model conducting overnight research to deliver morning updates based on user history and connected apps. OpenAI calls it "personalized research and timely updates that appear regularly to keep you informed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Pulse works by analyzing a user's chat history, saved preferences, and optional connections to Gmail and Google Calendar each night. The next morning, users receive visual "cards" (small illustrated squares with topic summaries that can be expanded for detail) containing updates on topics the model determines are relevant, such as project follow-ups, dinner suggestions, or travel recommendations. Users can provide feedback through thumbs up or down ratings and request specific topics through a "curate" button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI says that rather than waiting for users to initiate conversations, ChatGPT now attempts to deliver information preemptively using what OpenAI calls "asynchronous research," essentially having the model generate queries and responses overnight using traditional methods. Updates appear once daily and disappear after 24 hours unless users save them or ask follow-up questions, which converts them into standard chat conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can also connect Gmail and Google Calendar to provide additional context for what OpenAI calls more relevant suggestions. When Calendar is connected, ChatGPT might draft a sample meeting agenda, remind users to buy a birthday gift, or surface restaurant recommendations for an upcoming trip. These integrations are off by default and can be toggled in settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like most modern AI products based on large language models, which draw from patterns absorbed through training datasets, there's a catch: Its success rate is highly variable based on the topic at hand. OpenAI says it tested the new Pulse feature with college students through its ChatGPT Lab program, finding that users "started to feel its utility once they started telling ChatGPT what they wanted to see."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company acknowledges that Pulse "won't always get things right" and may suggest tips for completed projects or miss relevant topics entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI’s move toward proactive assistants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulse follows OpenAI's January introduction of Tasks, a feature that lets Plus and Pro subscribers schedule ChatGPT to perform specific actions at set times. While Tasks requires users to explicitly tell ChatGPT what to do and when (such as sending reminders or generating responses on a schedule), Pulse takes the next step by having ChatGPT choose what information to research and present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both features reflect OpenAI's broader marketing push toward what the industry calls "agentic AI," where models operate autonomously within defined boundaries rather than simply interactively responding to prompts. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have previously released agentic features that conduct detailed research and deliver reports to users in the background when they are complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, OpenAI describes Pulse as "the first step toward a new paradigm for interacting with AI" and says future versions will connect to additional apps and deliver updates throughout the day rather than once each morning. The company envisions AI systems that can "research, plan, and take helpful actions" based on user direction, though the current version remains limited to information delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's unclear how useful Pulse will be. OpenAI has experimented with many ChatGPT features over the years, some of which become essential and some fall by the wayside. We have not tried Pulse ourselves yet but will likely report back on that topic in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature currently works only on mobile devices for Pro tier subscribers, who pay $200 per month for access to OpenAI's most capable models. OpenAI plans to expand Pulse to Plus subscribers (who pay $20 monthly) after gathering feedback from the initial release, with an eventual goal of making it available to free users.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Pulse, a new "push" feature that generates personalized daily updates for users without having to ask each time. The preview feature, available now for Pro subscribers on mobile, marks OpenAI's latest attempt to make ChatGPT proactive rather than reactive, with the AI model conducting overnight research to deliver morning updates based on user history and connected apps. OpenAI calls it "personalized research and timely updates that appear regularly to keep you informed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Pulse works by analyzing a user's chat history, saved preferences, and optional connections to Gmail and Google Calendar each night. The next morning, users receive visual "cards" (small illustrated squares with topic summaries that can be expanded for detail) containing updates on topics the model determines are relevant, such as project follow-ups, dinner suggestions, or travel recommendations. Users can provide feedback through thumbs up or down ratings and request specific topics through a "curate" button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI says that rather than waiting for users to initiate conversations, ChatGPT now attempts to deliver information preemptively using what OpenAI calls "asynchronous research," essentially having the model generate queries and responses overnight using traditional methods. Updates appear once daily and disappear after 24 hours unless users save them or ask follow-up questions, which converts them into standard chat conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can also connect Gmail and Google Calendar to provide additional context for what OpenAI calls more relevant suggestions. When Calendar is connected, ChatGPT might draft a sample meeting agenda, remind users to buy a birthday gift, or surface restaurant recommendations for an upcoming trip. These integrations are off by default and can be toggled in settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like most modern AI products based on large language models, which draw from patterns absorbed through training datasets, there's a catch: Its success rate is highly variable based on the topic at hand. OpenAI says it tested the new Pulse feature with college students through its ChatGPT Lab program, finding that users "started to feel its utility once they started telling ChatGPT what they wanted to see."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The company acknowledges that Pulse "won't always get things right" and may suggest tips for completed projects or miss relevant topics entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI’s move toward proactive assistants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulse follows OpenAI's January introduction of Tasks, a feature that lets Plus and Pro subscribers schedule ChatGPT to perform specific actions at set times. While Tasks requires users to explicitly tell ChatGPT what to do and when (such as sending reminders or generating responses on a schedule), Pulse takes the next step by having ChatGPT choose what information to research and present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both features reflect OpenAI's broader marketing push toward what the industry calls "agentic AI," where models operate autonomously within defined boundaries rather than simply interactively responding to prompts. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have previously released agentic features that conduct detailed research and deliver reports to users in the background when they are complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, OpenAI describes Pulse as "the first step toward a new paradigm for interacting with AI" and says future versions will connect to additional apps and deliver updates throughout the day rather than once each morning. The company envisions AI systems that can "research, plan, and take helpful actions" based on user direction, though the current version remains limited to information delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's unclear how useful Pulse will be. OpenAI has experimented with many ChatGPT features over the years, some of which become essential and some fall by the wayside. We have not tried Pulse ourselves yet but will likely report back on that topic in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature currently works only on mobile devices for Pro tier subscribers, who pay $200 per month for access to OpenAI's most capable models. OpenAI plans to expand Pulse to Plus subscribers (who pay $20 monthly) after gathering feedback from the initial release, with an eventual goal of making it available to free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chuck Tybur, head of the NVIDIA Partner Network, gave opening remarks, highlighting the importance of sovereign AI. He said key components for sovereign AI success include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An AI imperative, understanding domestic AI capabilities are critical to economic growth, national security, cultural preservation and innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An AI ecosystem of developers, scientists, entrepreneurs, investors, enterprises and government organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An AI-ready workforce comprising a wide range of AI skills and talent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI models and data tailored to a region’s language, culture and needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI factories that are locally owned, operated and governed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest AI trends in Vietnam showcase how the technology is driving digital transformation across government services, finance, smart manufacturing, healthcare and creative industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vietnamese people have achieved remarkable excellence in STEM fields, with many young students excelling in mathematics, science and technology,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, during his visit to Vietnam last year. “This provides a solid foundation for developing future technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers help showcase the Vietnam AI ecosystem’s ongoing growth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-evolution-of-a-cloud-original"&gt;The evolution of a cloud original&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Box launched before “the cloud” was a buzzword and outlasted a wave of competitors that couldn’t scale or adapt. Aaron Levie’s perspective — as both a visionary founder and a long-term public company CEO — is a rare combination. He’ll reflect on the hardest pivots, biggest surprises, and the mindset it takes to keep evolving when the tech landscape moves at warp speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why you don’t want to miss it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aaron Levie helped define cloud collaboration before it was a trend, and he’s still setting the bar. This fireside chat will go deep on what it takes to build something that lasts — not just in terms of product, but also culture, strategy, and mindset. Whether you’re navigating early growth or managing scale, this is one session you’ll want to take notes on.&lt;/p&gt;
