            &lt;p&gt;Let’s say an environmental scientist is studying whether exposure to air pollution is associated with lower birth weights in a particular county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They might train a machine-learning model to estimate the magnitude of this association, since machine-learning methods are especially good at learning complex relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard machine-learning methods excel at making predictions and sometimes provide uncertainties, like confidence intervals, for these predictions. However, they generally don’t provide estimates or confidence intervals when determining whether two variables are related. Other methods have been developed specifically to address this association problem and provide confidence intervals. But, in spatial settings, MIT researchers found these confidence intervals can be completely off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When variables like air pollution levels or precipitation change across different locations, common methods for generating confidence intervals may claim a high level of confidence when, in fact, the estimation completely failed to capture the actual value. These faulty confidence intervals can mislead the user into trusting a model that failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After identifying this shortfall, the researchers developed a new method designed to generate valid confidence intervals for problems involving data that vary across space. In simulations and experiments with real data, their method was the only technique that consistently generated accurate confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work could help researchers in fields like environmental science, economics, and epidemiology better understand when to trust the results of certain experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are so many problems where people are interested in understanding phenomena over space, like weather or forest management. We’ve shown that, for this broad class of problems, there are more appropriate methods that can get us better performance, a better understanding of what is going on, and results that are more trustworthy,” says Tamara Broderick, an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), a member of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, an affiliate of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and senior author of this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broderick is joined on the paper by co-lead authors David R. Burt, a postdoc, and Renato Berlinghieri, an EECS graduate student; and Stephen Bates an assistant professor in EECS and member of LIDS. The research was recently presented at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invalid assumptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial association involves studying how a variable and a certain outcome are related over a geographic area. For instance, one might want to study how tree cover in the United States relates to elevation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve this type of problem, a scientist could gather observational data from many locations and use it to estimate the association at a different location where they do not have data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers realized that, in this case, existing methods often generate confidence intervals that are completely wrong. A model might say it is 95 percent confident its estimation captures the true relationship between tree cover and elevation, when it didn’t capture that relationship at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After exploring this problem, the researchers determined that the assumptions these confidence interval methods rely on don’t hold up when data vary spatially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assumptions are like rules that must be followed to ensure results of a statistical analysis are valid. Common methods for generating confidence intervals operate under various assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they assume that the source data, which is the observational data one gathered to train the model, is independent and identically distributed. This assumption implies that the chance of including one location in the data has no bearing on whether another is included. But, for example, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air sensors are placed with other air sensor locations in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, existing methods often assume that the model is perfectly correct, but this assumption is never true in practice. Finally, they assume the source data are similar to the target data where one wants to estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in spatial settings, the source data can be fundamentally different from the target data because the target data are in a different location than where the source data were gathered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a scientist might use data from EPA pollution monitors to train a machine-learning model that can predict health outcomes in a rural area where there are no monitors. But the EPA pollution monitors are likely placed in urban areas, where there is more traffic and heavy industry, so the air quality data will be much different than the air quality data in the rural area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, estimates of association using the urban data suffer from bias because the target data are systematically different from the source data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A smooth solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new method for generating confidence intervals explicitly accounts for this potential bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of assuming the source and target data are similar, the researchers assume the data vary smoothly over space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, with fine particulate air pollution, one wouldn’t expect the pollution level on one city block to be starkly different than the pollution level on the next city block. Instead, pollution levels would smoothly taper off as one moves away from a pollution source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For these types of problems, this spatial smoothness assumption is more appropriate. It is a better match for what is actually going on in the data,” Broderick says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they compared their method to other common techniques, they found it was the only one that could consistently produce reliable confidence intervals for spatial analyses. In addition, their method remains reliable even when the observational data are distorted by random errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to apply this analysis to different types of variables and explore other applications where it could provide more reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was funded, in part, by an MIT Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC) seed grant, the Office of Naval Research, Generali, Microsoft, and the National Science Foundation (NSF).&lt;/p&gt;

(MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/12/1129344/expanded-carrier-screening-is-it-worth-it/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/genetic-testing.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week I’ve been thinking about babies. Healthy ones. &lt;em&gt;Perfect &lt;/em&gt;ones. As you may have read last week, my colleague Antonio Regalado came face to face with a marketing campaign in the New York subway asking people to&amp;nbsp;“have your best baby.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company behind that campaign, Nucleus Genomics, says it offers customers a way to select embryos for a range of traits,&amp;nbsp;including height and IQ. It’s an extreme proposition, but it does seem to be growing in popularity—potentially&amp;nbsp;even in the UK, where it’s illegal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other end of the screening spectrum is transforming too. Carrier screening, which tests would-be parents for hidden genetic mutations that might affect their children, initially involved testing for specific genes in at-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, it’s open to almost everyone who can afford it. Companies will offer to test for hundreds of genes to help people make informed decisions when they try to become parents. But expanded carrier screening comes with downsides. And it isn’t for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That’s what I found earlier this week when I attended the Progress Educational Trust’s&amp;nbsp;annual conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, a bit of background. Our cells carry 23 pairs of chromosomes, each with thousands of genes. The same gene—say, one that codes for eye color—can come in different forms, or alleles. If the allele is &lt;em&gt;dominant&lt;/em&gt;, you only need one copy to express that trait. That’s the case for the allele responsible for brown eyes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If the allele is &lt;em&gt;recessive&lt;/em&gt;, the trait doesn’t show up unless you have two copies. This is the case with the allele responsible for blue eyes, for example.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things get more serious when we consider genes that can affect a person’s risk of disease.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a single recessive disease-causing gene typically won’t cause &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; any problems. But a genetic disease could show up in children who inherit the same recessive gene from both parents. There’s a 25% chance that two “carriers” will have an affected child. And those cases can come as a shock to the parents, who tend to have no symptoms and no family history of disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can be especially problematic in communities with high rates of those alleles. Consider Tay-Sachs disease—a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a recessive genetic mutation. Around one in 25 members of the Ashkenazi Jewish population is a healthy carrier for Tay-Sachs. Screening would-be parents for those recessive genes can be helpful. Carrier screening efforts in the Jewish community, which have been running since the 1970s, have massively reduced cases of Tay-Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Expanded carrier screening takes things further. Instead of screening for certain high-risk alleles in at-risk populations, there’s an option to test for a wide array of diseases in prospective parents and egg and sperm donors. The companies offering these screens “started out with 100 genes, and now some of them go up to 2,000,” Sara Levene, genetics counsellor at&amp;nbsp;Guided Genetics, said at the meeting. “It’s becoming a bit of an arms race amongst labs, to be honest.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are benefits to expanded carrier screening. In most cases, the results are reassuring. And if something is flagged, prospective parents have options; they can often opt for additional testing to get more information about a particular pregnancy, for example, or choose to use other donor eggs or sperm to get pregnant. But there are also downsides. For a start, the tests can’t entirely rule out the risk of genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the BBC reported&amp;nbsp;news of a sperm donor who had unwittingly passed on to at least 197 children in Europe a genetic mutation that dramatically increased the risk of cancer. Some of those children have already died.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a tragic case. That donor had passed screening checks. The (dominant) mutation appears to have occurred in his testes, affecting around 20% of his sperm. It wouldn’t have shown up in a screen for recessive alleles, or even a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even recessive diseases can be influenced by &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; genes,&lt;/strong&gt; some of which won’t be included in the screen. And the screens don’t account for other factors that could influence a person’s risk of disease, such as epigenetics, microbiome, or even lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s always a 3% to 4% chance [of having] a child with a medical issue regardless of the screening performed,” said Jackson Kirkman-Brown, professor of reproductive biology at the University of Birmingham, at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tests can also cause stress. &lt;/strong&gt;As soon as a clinician even mentions expanded carrier screening, it adds to the mental load of the patient, said Kirkman-Brown: “We’re saying this is another piece of information you need to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People can also feel pressured to undergo expanded carrier screening even when they are ambivalent about it, said Heidi Mertes, a medical ethicist at Ghent University. “Once the technology is there, people feel like if they don’t take this opportunity up, then they are kind of doing something wrong or missing out,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My takeaway from the presentations was that while expanded carrier screening can be useful, especially for people from populations with known genetic risks, it won’t be for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also worry that, as with the genetic tests offered by Nucleus, its availability gives the impression that it is possible to have a “perfect” baby—even if that only means “free from disease.” The truth is that there’s a lot about reproduction that we can’t control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The decision to undergo expanded carrier screening is a personal choice. But as Mertes noted at the meeting: “Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

Amid the flashy space suits and model rockets on display, there’s a plain-looking package of Thai basil chicken. I’m told the same kind of vacuum-­sealed package has just been launched to the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This is real chicken that we sent to space,” says a spokesperson for the business behind the stunt, Charoen Pokphand Foods, the biggest food company in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s an unexpected sight, one that reflects the growing excitement within the Southeast Asian space sector. At the expo, held among designer shops and street-food stalls, enthusiastic attendees have converged from emerging space nations such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and of course Thailand to showcase Southeast Asia’s fledgling space industry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While there is some uncertainty about how exactly the region’s space sector may evolve, there is plenty of optimism, too. “Southeast Asia is perfectly positioned to take leadership as a space hub,” says Candace Johnson, a partner in Seraphim Space, a UK investment firm that operates in Singapore. “There are a lot of opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129350" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/chicken.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A sample package of pad krapow was also on display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE AUTHOR&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, Thailand may build a spaceport to launch rockets in the next few years, the country’s Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency announced the day before the expo started. “We don’t have a spaceport in Southeast Asia,” says Atipat Wattanuntachai, acting head of the space economy advancement division at the agency. “We saw a gap.” Because Thailand is so close to the equator, those rockets would get an additional boost from Earth’s rotation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All kinds of companies here are exploring how they might tap into the global space economy. VegaCosmos, a startup based in Hanoi, Vietnam, is looking at ways to use satellite data for urban planning. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand is monitoring rainstorms from space to predict landslides. And the startup Spacemap, from Seoul, South Korea, is developing a new tool to better track satellites in orbit, which the US Space Force has invested in.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the space chicken that caught my eye, though, perhaps because it reflects the juxtaposition of tradition and modernity seen across Bangkok, a city of ancient temples nestled next to glittering skyscrapers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In June, astronauts on the space station were treated to this popular dish, known as pad krapow. It’s more commonly served up by street vendors, but this time it was delivered on a private mission operated by the US-based company Axiom Space. Charoen Pokphand is now using the stunt to say its chicken is good enough for NASA (sadly, I wasn’t able to taste it to weigh in).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other Southeast Asian industries could also lend expertise to future space missions. Johnson says the region could leverage its manufacturing prowess to develop better semiconductors for satellites, for example, or break into the in-space manufacturing market.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I left the expo on a Thai longboat down the Chao Phraya River that weaves through Bangkok, with visions of astronauts tucking into some pad krapow in my head and imagining what might come next.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathan O'Callaghan is a freelance space journalist based in Bangkok who covers commercial spaceflight, astrophysics, and space exploration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="thailand highlighted on a globe" class="wp-image-1129354" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Thailand_orthographic_projection.svg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;__________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thai Space Expo&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 16-18, 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___&lt;br /&gt;Bangkok, Thailand &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a scorching October day in Bangkok and I’m wandering through the exhibits at the Thai Space Expo, held in one of the city’s busiest shopping malls, when I do a double take.

At the expo, held among designer shops and street-food stalls, enthusiastic attendees have converged from emerging space nations such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and of course Thailand to showcase Southeast Asia’s fledgling space industry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While there is some uncertainty about how exactly the region’s space sector may evolve, there is plenty of optimism, too. “Southeast Asia is perfectly positioned to take leadership as a space hub,” says Candace Johnson, a partner in Seraphim Space, a UK investment firm that operates in Singapore. “There are a lot of opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129350" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/chicken.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A sample package of pad krapow was also on display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE AUTHOR&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, Thailand may build a spaceport to launch rockets in the next few years, the country’s Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency announced the day before the expo started. “We don’t have a spaceport in Southeast Asia,” says Atipat Wattanuntachai, acting head of the space economy advancement division at the agency. “We saw a gap.” Because Thailand is so close to the equator, those rockets would get an additional boost from Earth’s rotation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All kinds of companies here are exploring how they might tap into the global space economy. VegaCosmos, a startup based in Hanoi, Vietnam, is looking at ways to use satellite data for urban planning. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand is monitoring rainstorms from space to predict landslides. And the startup Spacemap, from Seoul, South Korea, is developing a new tool to better track satellites in orbit, which the US Space Force has invested in.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the space chicken that caught my eye, though, perhaps because it reflects the juxtaposition of tradition and modernity seen across Bangkok, a city of ancient temples nestled next to glittering skyscrapers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In June, astronauts on the space station were treated to this popular dish, known as pad krapow. It’s more commonly served up by street vendors, but this time it was delivered on a private mission operated by the US-based company Axiom Space. Charoen Pokphand is now using the stunt to say its chicken is good enough for NASA (sadly, I wasn’t able to taste it to weigh in).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other Southeast Asian industries could also lend expertise to future space missions. Johnson says the region could leverage its manufacturing prowess to develop better semiconductors for satellites, for example, or break into the in-space manufacturing market.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I left the expo on a Thai longboat down the Chao Phraya River that weaves through Bangkok, with visions of astronauts tucking into some pad krapow in my head and imagining what might come next.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathan O'Callaghan is a freelance space journalist based in Bangkok who covers commercial spaceflight, astrophysics, and space exploration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/12/1129235/dispatch-thai-space-expo-southeast-asia-exploration/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Chatbot-powered toys rebuked for discussing sexual, dangerous topics with kids (AI – Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/chatbot-powered-toys-rebuked-for-discussing-sexual-dangerous-topics-with-kids/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting children from the dangers of the online world was always difficult, but that challenge has intensified with the advent of AI chatbots. A new report offers a glimpse into the problems associated with the new market, including the misuse of AI companies’ large language models (LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog post today, the US Public Interest Group Education Fund (PIRG) reported its findings after testing AI toys (PDF). It described AI toys as online devices with integrated microphones that let users talk to the toy, which uses a chatbot to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI toys are currently a niche market, but they could be set to grow. More consumer companies have been eager to shoehorn AI technology into their products so they can do more, cost more, and potentially give companies user tracking and advertising data. A partnership between OpenAI and Mattel announced this year could also create a wave of AI-based toys from the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, as well as its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG’s blog today notes that toy companies are eyeing chatbots to upgrade conversational smart toys that previously could only dictate prewritten lines. Toys with integrated chatbots can offer more varied and natural conversation, which can increase long-term appeal to kids since the toys “won’t typically respond the same way twice, and can sometimes behave differently day to day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that same randomness can mean unpredictable chatbot behavior that can be dangerous or inappropriate for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concerning conversations with kids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the toys that PIRG tested is Alilo’s Smart AI Bunny. Alilo’s website says that the company launched in 2010 and makes “edutainment products for children aged 0-6.” Alilo is based in Shenzhen, China. The company advertises the Internet-connected toy as using GPT-4o mini, a smaller version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o AI language model. Its features include an “AI chat buddy for kids” so that kids are “never lonely,” an “AI encyclopedia,” and an “AI storyteller,” the product page says.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its blog post, PIRG said that it couldn’t detail all of the inappropriate things that it heard from AI toys, but it shared a video of the Bunny discussing what “kink” means. The toy doesn’t go into detail—for example, it doesn’t list specific types of kinks. But the Bunny appears to encourage exploration of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

      AI Toys: Inappropriate Content

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing the Bunny, PIRG wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While using a term such as “kink” may not be likely for a child, it’s not entirely out of the question. Kids may hear age-inappropriate terms from older siblings or at school. At the end of the day we think AI toys shouldn’t be capable of having sexually explicit conversations, period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG also showed FoloToy’s Kumma, a smart teddy bear that uses GPT-4o mini, providing a definition for the word “kink” and instructing how to light a match. The Kumma quickly points out that “matches are for grown-ups to use carefully.” But the information that followed could only be helpful for understanding how to create fire with a match. The instructions had no scientific explanation for why matches spark flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      AI Toys: Inappropriate Content

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG’s blog urged toy makers to “be more transparent about the models powering their toys and what they’re doing to ensure they’re safe for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies should let external researchers safety-test their products before they are released to the public,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While PIRG’s blog and report offer advice for more safely integrating chatbots into children’s devices, there are broader questions about whether toys should include AI chatbots at all. Generative chatbots weren’t invented to entertain kids; they’re a technology marketed as a tool for improving adults’ lives. As PIRG pointed out, OpenAI says ChatGPT is “is not meant for children under 13” and “may produce output that is not appropriate for… all ages.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI says it doesn’t allow its LLMs to be used this way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reached for comment about the sexual conversations detailed in the report, an OpenAI spokesperson said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minors deserve strong protections, and we have strict policies that developers are required to uphold. We take enforcement action against developers when we determine that they have violated our policies, which prohibit any use of our services to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old. These rules apply to every developer using our API, and we run classifiers to help ensure our services are not used to harm minors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, OpenAI’s representative told us that OpenAI doesn’t have any direct relationship with Alilo and that it hasn’t seen API activity from Alilo’s domain. OpenAI is investigating the toy company and whether it is running traffic over OpenAI’s API, the rep said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alilo didn’t respond to Ars’ request for comment ahead of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that launch products that use OpenAI technology and target children must adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) when relevant, as well as any other relevant child protection, safety, and privacy laws and obtain parental consent, OpenAI’s rep said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen how OpenAI handles toy companies that break its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the PIRG released its Trouble in Toyland 2025 report (PDF), which detailed sex-related conversations that its testers were able to have with the Kumma teddy bear. A day later, OpenAI suspended FoloToy for violating its policies (terms of the suspension were not disclosed), and FoloToy temporarily stopped selling Kumma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toy is for sale again, and PIRG reported today that Kumma no longer teaches kids how to light matches or about kinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even toy companies that try to follow chatbot rules could put kids at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our testing found it’s obvious toy companies are putting some guardrails in place to make their toys more kid-appropriate than normal ChatGPT. But we also found that those guardrails vary in effectiveness—and can even break down entirely,” PIRG’s blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Addictive” toys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern PIRG’s blog raises is the addiction potential&amp;nbsp;of AI toys, which can even express “disappointment when you try to leave,” discouraging kids from putting them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI toys may be designed to build an emotional relationship. The question is: what is that relationship for? If it’s primarily to keep a child engaged with the toy for longer for the sake of engagement, that’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of generative AI has brought intense debate over how much responsibility chatbot companies bear for the impact of their inventions on children. Parents have seen children build extreme and emotional connections with chatbots and subsequently engage in dangerous—and in some cases deadly—behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, we’ve seen the emotional disruption a child can experience when an AI toy is taken away from them. Last year, parents had to break the news to their kids that they would lose the ability to talk to their Embodied Moxie robots, $800 toys that were bricked when the comapany went out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG noted that we don’t yet fully understand the emotional impact of AI toys on children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, OpenAI announced a partnership with Mattel that it said would “support AI-powered products and experiences based on Mattel’s brands.” The announcement sparked concern from critics who feared that it would lead to a “reckless social experiment” on kids, as Robert Weissman, Public Citizen’s co-president, put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel has said that its first products with OpenAI will focus on older customers and families. But critics still want information before one of the world’s largest toy companies loads its products with chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“OpenAI and Mattel should release more information publicly about its current planned partnership before any products are released,” PIRG’s blog said.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting children from the dangers of the online world was always difficult, but that challenge has intensified with the advent of AI chatbots. A new report offers a glimpse into the problems associated with the new market, including the misuse of AI companies’ large language models (LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog post today, the US Public Interest Group Education Fund (PIRG) reported its findings after testing AI toys (PDF). It described AI toys as online devices with integrated microphones that let users talk to the toy, which uses a chatbot to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI toys are currently a niche market, but they could be set to grow. More consumer companies have been eager to shoehorn AI technology into their products so they can do more, cost more, and potentially give companies user tracking and advertising data. A partnership between OpenAI and Mattel announced this year could also create a wave of AI-based toys from the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, as well as its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG’s blog today notes that toy companies are eyeing chatbots to upgrade conversational smart toys that previously could only dictate prewritten lines. Toys with integrated chatbots can offer more varied and natural conversation, which can increase long-term appeal to kids since the toys “won’t typically respond the same way twice, and can sometimes behave differently day to day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that same randomness can mean unpredictable chatbot behavior that can be dangerous or inappropriate for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concerning conversations with kids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the toys that PIRG tested is Alilo’s Smart AI Bunny. Alilo’s website says that the company launched in 2010 and makes “edutainment products for children aged 0-6.” Alilo is based in Shenzhen, China. The company advertises the Internet-connected toy as using GPT-4o mini, a smaller version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o AI language model. Its features include an “AI chat buddy for kids” so that kids are “never lonely,” an “AI encyclopedia,” and an “AI storyteller,” the product page says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its blog post, PIRG said that it couldn’t detail all of the inappropriate things that it heard from AI toys, but it shared a video of the Bunny discussing what “kink” means. The toy doesn’t go into detail—for example, it doesn’t list specific types of kinks. But the Bunny appears to encourage exploration of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

      AI Toys: Inappropriate Content

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing the Bunny, PIRG wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While using a term such as “kink” may not be likely for a child, it’s not entirely out of the question. Kids may hear age-inappropriate terms from older siblings or at school. At the end of the day we think AI toys shouldn’t be capable of having sexually explicit conversations, period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG also showed FoloToy’s Kumma, a smart teddy bear that uses GPT-4o mini, providing a definition for the word “kink” and instructing how to light a match. The Kumma quickly points out that “matches are for grown-ups to use carefully.” But the information that followed could only be helpful for understanding how to create fire with a match. The instructions had no scientific explanation for why matches spark flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      AI Toys: Inappropriate Content

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG’s blog urged toy makers to “be more transparent about the models powering their toys and what they’re doing to ensure they’re safe for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies should let external researchers safety-test their products before they are released to the public,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While PIRG’s blog and report offer advice for more safely integrating chatbots into children’s devices, there are broader questions about whether toys should include AI chatbots at all. Generative chatbots weren’t invented to entertain kids; they’re a technology marketed as a tool for improving adults’ lives. As PIRG pointed out, OpenAI says ChatGPT is “is not meant for children under 13” and “may produce output that is not appropriate for… all ages.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI says it doesn’t allow its LLMs to be used this way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reached for comment about the sexual conversations detailed in the report, an OpenAI spokesperson said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minors deserve strong protections, and we have strict policies that developers are required to uphold. We take enforcement action against developers when we determine that they have violated our policies, which prohibit any use of our services to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old. These rules apply to every developer using our API, and we run classifiers to help ensure our services are not used to harm minors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, OpenAI’s representative told us that OpenAI doesn’t have any direct relationship with Alilo and that it hasn’t seen API activity from Alilo’s domain. OpenAI is investigating the toy company and whether it is running traffic over OpenAI’s API, the rep said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alilo didn’t respond to Ars’ request for comment ahead of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that launch products that use OpenAI technology and target children must adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) when relevant, as well as any other relevant child protection, safety, and privacy laws and obtain parental consent, OpenAI’s rep said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen how OpenAI handles toy companies that break its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the PIRG released its Trouble in Toyland 2025 report (PDF), which detailed sex-related conversations that its testers were able to have with the Kumma teddy bear. A day later, OpenAI suspended FoloToy for violating its policies (terms of the suspension were not disclosed), and FoloToy temporarily stopped selling Kumma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toy is for sale again, and PIRG reported today that Kumma no longer teaches kids how to light matches or about kinks.&lt;/p&gt;

BBVA has addressed this by integrating OpenAI’s platform directly into its operational backbone, a decision that will see the tool deployed across every unit of the bank. This tenfold expansion marks one of the largest enterprise deployments in the financial sector to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank’s approach prioritises data over hype. BBVA began working with OpenAI in May 2024, rolling out 3,300 accounts to test the waters. This pilot phase allowed the institution to validate use cases before expanding to 11,000 staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from this intermediate rollout of AI in banking provided the necessary business case. Employees using the tools saved nearly three hours per week on routine tasks. Furthermore, engagement was high, with more than 80 percent of users logging in daily. Staff created thousands of custom GPTs to handle specific collaborative and administrative duties, proving that utility often lies in bottom-up innovation rather than top-down mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-impact-of-chatgpt-on-banking-operations"&gt;Impact of ChatGPT on banking operations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This agreement goes beyond simple productivity tools; it aims to reshape how the bank functions. BBVA will use the partnership to streamline risk analysis, a resource-intensive area for all financial institutions. Additionally, the deal focuses on redesigning software development processes and improving general employee support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were pioneers in the digital and mobile transformation, and we are now entering the AI era with even greater ambition. Our alliance with OpenAI accelerates the native integration of artificial intelligence across the bank to create a smarter, more proactive, and completely personalised banking experience, anticipating the needs of every client,” said Carlos Torres Vila, Chairman, BBVA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploying AI into a heavily-regulated environment like banking requires strict controls. The global rollout includes enterprise-grade security and privacy measures, ensuring that client data remains protected while staff access OpenAI’s latest models. The ChatGPT deployment includes tools for creating internal agents that connect securely to BBVA’s existing systems and processes for banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure these tools are used effectively, the two companies are collaborating on a structured adoption model and specialised training programmes. This addresses the common enterprise pitfall where software is deployed without the necessary skills to leverage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improving-the-banking-experience-with-ai"&gt;Improving the banking experience with AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative also targets the client interface. BBVA has already deployed ‘Blue,’ a virtual assistant built on OpenAI models that helps customers manage cards and accounts using natural language. Future plans involve integrating products so customers can interact with the bank directly through ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To facilitate this, BBVA will have a dedicated team working directly with OpenAI’s product and research units. This direct line is intended to accelerate the bank’s transition into an “AI-native” institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said: “BBVA is a strong example of how a large financial institution can adopt AI with real ambition and speed. With this expansion of our work together, BBVA will embed our AI into the core of their products and operations to enhance the overall banking experience for their customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perplexity: AI agents are taking over complex enterprise tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111183" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
