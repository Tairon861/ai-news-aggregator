Once the police had “matches” to a few relatives of the killer, they built a large family tree from which they plucked the likely suspect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This process, called forensic investigative genetic genealogy, or FIGG, has since helped solve hundreds of murders and sexual assaults. Still, while the technology is potent, it’s incompletely realized. It operates via a mishmash of private labs and unregulated websites, like FamilyTree, which give users a choice to opt into or out of police searches. The number of profiles available for search by police hovers around 1.5 million, not yet enough to find matches in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To do my bit to increase those numbers, I traveled to Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The staff of the local district attorney, Anthony D. Gulluni, was giving away free FamilyTree tests at a minor-league hockey game in an effort to widen its DNA net and help solve several cold-case murders. After glancing over a consent form, I spit into a tube and handed it back. According to the promotional material from Gulluni’s office, I’d “become a hero.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I wasn’t really driven by some urge to capture distantly related serial killers.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather, my spit had a less gallant and more quarrelsome motive: to troll privacy advocates whose fears around DNA I think are overblown and unhelpful. By giving up my saliva for inspection, I was going against the view that a person’s DNA is the individualized, sacred text that privacy advocates sometimes claim.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the only reason FIGG works is that relatives share DNA: You share about 50% with a parent, 25% with a grandparent, about 12.5% with a first cousin, and so on. When I got my FamilyTree report back, my DNA had “matched” with 3,309 people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people are frightened by FIGG or reject its punitive aims.&lt;/strong&gt; One European genealogist I know says her DNA is kept private because she opposes the death penalty and doesn’t want to risk aiding US authorities in cases where lethal injection might be applied. But if enough people share their DNA, conscientious objectors won’t matter. Scientists estimate that a database including 2% of the US population, or 6 million people, could identify the source of nearly any crime-scene DNA, given how many distant relatives each of us has.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scholars of big data have termed this phenomenon “tyranny of the minority.” One person’s voluntary disclosure can end up exposing the same information about many others. And that tyranny can be abused.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA information held in private genealogy websites like FamilyTree is lightly guarded by terms of service. &lt;/strong&gt;These agreements have flip-flopped over time; at one point all users were included in law enforcement searches by default. Rules are easily ignored, too. Recent court filings indicate that the FBI, in its zeal to solve crimes, sometimes barges past restrictions to look for matches in databases whose policies exclude police.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Noble aims; no rules” is how one genetic genealogist described the overall situation in her field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My uncertainty grew the more questions I asked.&lt;/strong&gt; Who even controls my DNA file? That’s not easy to find out. FamilyTree is a brand operated by another company, Gene by Gene, which in 2021 was sold to a third company, MyDNA—ultimately owned by an Australian mogul whose name appears nowhere on its website. When I reached FamilyTree’s general manager, the genealogist Dave Vance, he told me that three-quarters of the profiles on the site were “opted in” to law enforcement searches.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One solution holds that the federal government should organize its own national DNA database for FIGG. But that would require new laws, new technical standards, and a debate about how our society wants to employ this type of big data—not just getting individual consent like mine.

Space is the place. The final frontier. It is our human destiny to transcend our home world and expand our civilization to extraterrestrial vistas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This belief has been mainstream for decades, but its rise has been positively meteoric in this new gilded age of astropreneurs. Expanding humanity beyond Earth is both our birthright and our duty to the future, they insist. Failing to do so would consign our species to certain extinction—either by our own hand, perhaps through nuclear war or climate change, or in some cosmic disaster, like a massive asteroid impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as visions of giant orbital stations and Martian cities dance in our heads, a case against human space colonization has found its footing in a number of recent books. The argument grows from many grounds: Doubts about the practical feasibility of off-Earth communities. Concerns about the exorbitant costs, including who would bear them and who would profit. Realism about the harsh environment of space and the enormous tax it would exact on the human body. Suspicion of the underlying ideologies and mythologies that animate the race to settle space.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And, more bluntly, a recognition that “space sucks” and a lot of people have “underestimated the scale of suckitude,” as Kelly and Zach Weinersmith put it in their book &lt;em&gt;A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through?&lt;/em&gt;, which was released in paperback earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of A City on Mars" class="wp-image-1121786" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/book.mars_.jpg?w=1316" width="1316" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should&lt;br /&gt;We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly and Zach Weinersmith&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE, 2023&amp;nbsp;(PAPERBACK RELEASE 2025)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Weinersmiths, a husband-wife team, spent years thinking it through—in delightfully pragmatic detail.&lt;em&gt; A City on Mars &lt;/em&gt;provides ground truth for our lofty celestial dreams by gaming out the medical, technical, legal, ethical, and existential consequences of space settlements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Much to the authors’ own dismay, the result is a grotesquery of possible outcomes including (but not limited to) Martian eugenics, interplanetary war, and—­memorably—“space cannibalism.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The Weinersmiths puncture the gauzy fantasy of space cities by asking pretty basic questions, like how to populate them. Astronauts experience all kinds of medical challenges in space, such as radiation exposure and bone loss, which would increase risks to both parents and babies. Nobody wants their pregnant “glow” to be a by-product of cosmic radiation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trying to bring forth babies in space “is going to be tricky business, not just in terms of science, but from the perspective of scientific ethics,” they write. “Adults can consent to being in experiments. Babies can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You don’t even have to contemplate going to Mars to make some version of this case. In &lt;em&gt;Ground Control: An Argument for the End of Human Space Exploration,&lt;/em&gt; Savannah Mandel chronicles how past and present generations have regarded human spaceflight as an affront to vulnerable children right here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of Ground Control" class="wp-image-1121785" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/book.control.jpg?w=858" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground Control: An Argument for the End of Human Space Exploration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Savannah Mandel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CHICAGO REVIEW PRESS, 2024&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hungry Kids Can’t Eat Moon Rocks,” read signs at a protest outside Kennedy Space Center on the eve of the Apollo 11 launch in July 1969. Gil Scott-Heron’s 1970 poem “Whitey on the Moon” rose to become the de facto anthem of this movement, which insists, to this day, that until humans get our earthly house in order, we have no business building new ones in outer space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ground Control,&lt;/em&gt; part memoir and part manifesto, channels this lament: How can we justify the enormous cost of sending people beyond our planet when there is so much suffering here at home?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Advocates for human space exploration reject the zero-sum framing and point to the many downstream benefits of human spaceflight. Space exploration has catalyzed inventions from the CAT scan to baby formula. There is also inherent value in our shared adventure of learning about the vast cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those upsides are real, but they are not remotely well distributed. Mandel predicts that the commercial space sector in its current form will only exacerbate inequalities on Earth, as profits from space ventures flow into the coffers of the already obscenely rich.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In her book, Mandel, a space anthropologist and scholar at Virginia Tech, describes a personal transformation from spacey dreamer to grounded critic. It began during fieldwork at Spaceport America, a commercial launch facility in New Mexico, where she began to see cracks in the dazzling future imagined by space billionaires. As her career took her from street protests in London to extravagant space industry banquets in Washington, DC, she writes, “crystal clear glasses” replaced “the rose-colored ones.”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Mandel remains enchanted by space but is skeptical that humans are the optimal trailblazers. Robots, rovers, probes, and other artificial space ambassadors could do the job for a fraction of the price and without risk to life, limb, and other corporeal vulnerabilities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A decentralization of self needs to occur,” she writes. “A dissolution of anthropocentrism, so to speak. And a recognition that future space explorers may not be man, even if man moves through them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, giant leaps for mankind no longer necessitate a man’s small steps; the wheels of a rover or the rotors of a copter offer a much better bang for our buck than boots on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Weinersmiths, Mandel devotes little attention to the physical dangers and limitations that space imposes on humans. She is more interested in a kind of psychic sickness that drives the impulse to abandon our planet and rush into new territories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a scholar of religion at Wesleyan University, presents a thorough diagnosis of this exact pathology in her 2022 book &lt;em&gt;Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race&lt;/em&gt;, which came out in paperback last year&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It all begins, appropriately enough, with the book of Genesis, where God creates Earth for the dominion of man. Over the years, this biblical brain worm has offered divine justification for the brutal colonization and environmental exploitation of our planet. Now it serves as the religious rocket fuel propelling humans into the next frontier, Rubenstein argues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of Astrotopia" class="wp-image-1121784" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/book.astrotopia.jpg?w=1241" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary-Jane Rubenstein&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS, 2022 &amp;nbsp;(PAPERBACK RELEASE 2024)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The intensifying ‘NewSpace race’ is as much a mythological project as it is a political, economic, or scientific one,” she writes. “It’s a mythology, in fact, that holds all these other efforts together, giving them an aura of duty, grandeur, and benevolence.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rubenstein makes a forceful case that malignant outgrowths of Christian ideas scaffold the dreams of space settlements championed by Musk, Bezos, and like-minded enthusiasts—even if these same people might never describe themselves as religious. If Earth is man’s dominion, space is the next logical step. Earth is just a temporary staging ground for a greater destiny; we will find our deliverance in the heavens.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Fuck Earth,” Elon Musk said in 2014. “Who cares about Earth? If we can establish a Mars colony, we can almost certainly colonize the whole solar system.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos, for one, claims to care about Earth; that’s among his best arguments for why humans should move beyond it. If heavy industries and large civilian populations cast off into the orbital expanse, our home world can be, in his words, “zoned residential and light industry,” allowing it to recover from anthropogenic pressures. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bezos also believes that space settlements are essential for the betterment of humanity, in part on the grounds that they will uncork our population growth. He envisions an orbital archipelago of stations, sprawled across the solar system, that could support a collective population of a trillion people. “That’s a thousand Mozarts. A thousand Einsteins,” Bezos has mused. “What a cool civilization that would be.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It does sound cool. But it’s an easy layup for Rubenstein: This “numbers game” approach would also produce a thousand Hitlers and Stalins, she writes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that is the real crux of the argument against pushing hard torapidly expand human civilization into space: We will still be humans when we get there. We won’t escape our vices and frailties by leaving Earth—in fact, we may exacerbate them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While all three books push back on the existential argument for space settlements, the Weinersmiths take the rebuttal one step further by proposing that space colonization might actually increase the risk of self-annihilation rather than neutralizing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Going to space will not end war because war isn’t caused by anything that space travel is apt to change, even in the most optimistic scenarios,” they write. “Humanity going to space en masse probably won’t reduce the likelihood of war, but we should consider that it might increase the chance of war being horrific.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The pair imagine rival space nations exchanging asteroid fire or poisoning whole biospheres. Proponents of space settlements often point to the fate of the dinosaurs as motivational grist, but what if a doomsday asteroid were deliberately flung between human cultures as a weapon? It may sound outlandish, but it’s no more speculative than a floating civilization with a thousand Mozarts. It follows the same logic of extrapolating our human future in space from our behavior on Earth in the past.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So should we just sit around and wait for our inevitable extinction? The three books have more or less the same response: What’s the rush? It is far more likely that humanity will be wiped out by our own activity in the near term than by any kind of cosmic threat. Worrying about the expansion of the sun in billions of years, as Musk has openly done, is frankly hysterical.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we have some growing up to do. Mandel and Rubenstein both argue that any worthy human future in space must adopt a decolonizing approach that emphasizes caretaking and stewardship of this planet and its inhabitants before we set off for others. They draw inspiration from science fiction, popular culture, and Indigenous knowledge, among other sources, to sketch out these alternative visions of an off-Earth future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mandel sees hope for this future in post-scarcity political theories. She cites various attempts to anticipate the needs of future generations—ideas found in the work of the social theorist Aaron Benanav, or in the values expressed by the Green New Deal, or in the fictional Ministry for the Future imagined by Kim Stanley Robinson in his 2020 novel of the same name. Whatever you think of the controversial 2025 book &lt;em&gt;Abundance&lt;/em&gt;, by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, it is also appealing to the same demand for a post-scarcity road map.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To that end, Mandel envisions “the creation of a governing body that would require that techno-scientific plans, especially those with a global reach, take into consideration multigenerational impacts and multigenerational voices.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Rubenstein, religion is the poison, but it may also offer the cure. She sees potential in a revival of pantheism, which is the belief that all the contents of the universe—from rocks to humans to galaxies—are divine and perhaps alive on some level. She hasn’t fully converted herself to this movement, let alone become an evangelist, but she says it’s a spiritual direction that could be an effective counterweight to dominionist views of the universe.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter whether … any sort of pantheism is ‘true,’” she writes. “What matters is the way any given mythology prompts us to interact with the world we’re a part of—the world each of our actions helps to make and unmake. And frankly, some mythologies prompt us to act better than others.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All these authors ultimately conclude that it would be great if humans lived in space—someday, if and when we’ve matured. But the three books all express concerns about efforts by commercial space companies, with the help of the US government, to bypass established space laws and norms—concerns that have been thoroughly validated in 2025.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The combustible relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has raised eyebrows about cronyism—and retribution—between governments and space companies. Space is rapidly becoming weaponized. And recent events have reminded us of the immense challenges of human spaceflight. SpaceX’s next-­generation Starship vehicle has suffered catastrophic failures in several test flights, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule experienced malfunctions that kept two astronauts on the International Space Station for months longer than expected. Even space tourism is developing a bad rap: In April, a star-studded all-woman crew on a Blue Origin suborbital flight was met with widespread backlash as a symbol of out-of-touch wealth and privilege.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is at this point that we must loop back to the issue of “suckitude,” which Mandel also channels in her book through the killer opening of M.T. Anderson’s novel &lt;em&gt;Feed&lt;/em&gt;: “We went to the moon to have fun, but the moon turned out to completely suck.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The dreams of space settlements put forward by Musk and Bezos are insanely fun. The reality may well suck. But it’s doubtful that any degree of suckitude will slow down the commercial space race, and the authors do at times seem to be yelling into the cosmic void.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, the books challenge space enthusiasts of all stripes to imagine new ways of relating to space that aren’t so tactile and exploitative. Along those lines, Rubenstein shares a compelling anecdote in &lt;em&gt;Astrotopia&lt;/em&gt; about an anthropologist who lived with an Inuit community in the early 1970s. When she told them about the Apollo moon landings, her hosts burst out in laughter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We didn’t know this was the first time you white people had been to the moon,” they said. “Our shamans go all the time … The issue is not whether we go to visit our relatives, but how we treat them and their homeland when we go.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Becky Ferreira is a science reporter based in upstate New York, and author of &lt;/em&gt;First Contact, &lt;em&gt;a book about the search for alien life, which will be published in September.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bitter rivals in the commercial space race, but they agree on one thing: Settling space is an existential imperative. Space is the place. The final frontier. It is our human destiny to transcend our home world and expand our civilization to extraterrestrial vistas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This belief has been mainstream for decades, but its rise has been positively meteoric in this new gilded age of astropreneurs. Expanding humanity beyond Earth is both our birthright and our duty to the future, they insist. Failing to do so would consign our species to certain extinction—either by our own hand, perhaps through nuclear war or climate change, or in some cosmic disaster, like a massive asteroid impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as visions of giant orbital stations and Martian cities dance in our heads, a case against human space colonization has found its footing in a number of recent books. The argument grows from many grounds: Doubts about the practical feasibility of off-Earth communities. Concerns about the exorbitant costs, including who would bear them and who would profit. Realism about the harsh environment of space and the enormous tax it would exact on the human body. Suspicion of the underlying ideologies and mythologies that animate the race to settle space.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And, more bluntly, a recognition that “space sucks” and a lot of people have “underestimated the scale of suckitude,” as Kelly and Zach Weinersmith put it in their book &lt;em&gt;A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through?&lt;/em&gt;, which was released in paperback earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of A City on Mars" class="wp-image-1121786" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/book.mars_.jpg?w=1316" width="1316" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should&lt;br /&gt;We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly and Zach Weinersmith&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE, 2023&amp;nbsp;(PAPERBACK RELEASE 2025)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Weinersmiths, a husband-wife team, spent years thinking it through—in delightfully pragmatic detail.&lt;em&gt; A City on Mars &lt;/em&gt;provides ground truth for our lofty celestial dreams by gaming out the medical, technical, legal, ethical, and existential consequences of space settlements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Much to the authors’ own dismay, the result is a grotesquery of possible outcomes including (but not limited to) Martian eugenics, interplanetary war, and—­memorably—“space cannibalism.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The Weinersmiths puncture the gauzy fantasy of space cities by asking pretty basic questions, like how to populate them. Astronauts experience all kinds of medical challenges in space, such as radiation exposure and bone loss, which would increase risks to both parents and babies. Nobody wants their pregnant “glow” to be a by-product of cosmic radiation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trying to bring forth babies in space “is going to be tricky business, not just in terms of science, but from the perspective of scientific ethics,” they write. “Adults can consent to being in experiments. Babies can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You don’t even have to contemplate going to Mars to make some version of this case. In &lt;em&gt;Ground Control: An Argument for the End of Human Space Exploration,&lt;/em&gt; Savannah Mandel chronicles how past and present generations have regarded human spaceflight as an affront to vulnerable children right here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of Ground Control" class="wp-image-1121785" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/book.control.jpg?w=858" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground Control: An Argument for the End of Human Space Exploration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Savannah Mandel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CHICAGO REVIEW PRESS, 2024&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hungry Kids Can’t Eat Moon Rocks,” read signs at a protest outside Kennedy Space Center on the eve of the Apollo 11 launch in July 1969. Gil Scott-Heron’s 1970 poem “Whitey on the Moon” rose to become the de facto anthem of this movement, which insists, to this day, that until humans get our earthly house in order, we have no business building new ones in outer space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ground Control,&lt;/em&gt; part memoir and part manifesto, channels this lament: How can we justify the enormous cost of sending people beyond our planet when there is so much suffering here at home?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Advocates for human space exploration reject the zero-sum framing and point to the many downstream benefits of human spaceflight. Space exploration has catalyzed inventions from the CAT scan to baby formula. There is also inherent value in our shared adventure of learning about the vast cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those upsides are real, but they are not remotely well distributed. Mandel predicts that the commercial space sector in its current form will only exacerbate inequalities on Earth, as profits from space ventures flow into the coffers of the already obscenely rich.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In her book, Mandel, a space anthropologist and scholar at Virginia Tech, describes a personal transformation from spacey dreamer to grounded critic. It began during fieldwork at Spaceport America, a commercial launch facility in New Mexico, where she began to see cracks in the dazzling future imagined by space billionaires. As her career took her from street protests in London to extravagant space industry banquets in Washington, DC, she writes, “crystal clear glasses” replaced “the rose-colored ones.”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Mandel remains enchanted by space but is skeptical that humans are the optimal trailblazers. Robots, rovers, probes, and other artificial space ambassadors could do the job for a fraction of the price and without risk to life, limb, and other corporeal vulnerabilities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A decentralization of self needs to occur,” she writes. “A dissolution of anthropocentrism, so to speak. And a recognition that future space explorers may not be man, even if man moves through them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, giant leaps for mankind no longer necessitate a man’s small steps; the wheels of a rover or the rotors of a copter offer a much better bang for our buck than boots on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Weinersmiths, Mandel devotes little attention to the physical dangers and limitations that space imposes on humans. She is more interested in a kind of psychic sickness that drives the impulse to abandon our planet and rush into new territories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a scholar of religion at Wesleyan University, presents a thorough diagnosis of this exact pathology in her 2022 book &lt;em&gt;Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race&lt;/em&gt;, which came out in paperback last year&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It all begins, appropriately enough, with the book of Genesis, where God creates Earth for the dominion of man. Over the years, this biblical brain worm has offered divine justification for the brutal colonization and environmental exploitation of our planet. Now it serves as the religious rocket fuel propelling humans into the next frontier, Rubenstein argues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of Astrotopia" class="wp-image-1121784" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/book.astrotopia.jpg?w=1241" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary-Jane Rubenstein&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS, 2022 &amp;nbsp;(PAPERBACK RELEASE 2024)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The intensifying ‘NewSpace race’ is as much a mythological project as it is a political, economic, or scientific one,” she writes. “It’s a mythology, in fact, that holds all these other efforts together, giving them an aura of duty, grandeur, and benevolence.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rubenstein makes a forceful case that malignant outgrowths of Christian ideas scaffold the dreams of space settlements championed by Musk, Bezos, and like-minded enthusiasts—even if these same people might never describe themselves as religious. If Earth is man’s dominion, space is the next logical step. Earth is just a temporary staging ground for a greater destiny; we will find our deliverance in the heavens.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Fuck Earth,” Elon Musk said in 2014. “Who cares about Earth? If we can establish a Mars colony, we can almost certainly colonize the whole solar system.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos, for one, claims to care about Earth; that’s among his best arguments for why humans should move beyond it. If heavy industries and large civilian populations cast off into the orbital expanse, our home world can be, in his words, “zoned residential and light industry,” allowing it to recover from anthropogenic pressures. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bezos also believes that space settlements are essential for the betterment of humanity, in part on the grounds that they will uncork our population growth. He envisions an orbital archipelago of stations, sprawled across the solar system, that could support a collective population of a trillion people. “That’s a thousand Mozarts. A thousand Einsteins,” Bezos has mused. “What a cool civilization that would be.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It does sound cool. But it’s an easy layup for Rubenstein: This “numbers game” approach would also produce a thousand Hitlers and Stalins, she writes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that is the real crux of the argument against pushing hard torapidly expand human civilization into space: We will still be humans when we get there. We won’t escape our vices and frailties by leaving Earth—in fact, we may exacerbate them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While all three books push back on the existential argument for space settlements, the Weinersmiths take the rebuttal one step further by proposing that space colonization might actually increase the risk of self-annihilation rather than neutralizing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Going to space will not end war because war isn’t caused by anything that space travel is apt to change, even in the most optimistic scenarios,” they write. “Humanity going to space en masse probably won’t reduce the likelihood of war, but we should consider that it might increase the chance of war being horrific.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The pair imagine rival space nations exchanging asteroid fire or poisoning whole biospheres. Proponents of space settlements often point to the fate of the dinosaurs as motivational grist, but what if a doomsday asteroid were deliberately flung between human cultures as a weapon? It may sound outlandish, but it’s no more speculative than a floating civilization with a thousand Mozarts. It follows the same logic of extrapolating our human future in space from our behavior on Earth in the past.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So should we just sit around and wait for our inevitable extinction? The three books have more or less the same response: What’s the rush? It is far more likely that humanity will be wiped out by our own activity in the near term than by any kind of cosmic threat. Worrying about the expansion of the sun in billions of years, as Musk has openly done, is frankly hysterical.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we have some growing up to do. Mandel and Rubenstein both argue that any worthy human future in space must adopt a decolonizing approach that emphasizes caretaking and stewardship of this planet and its inhabitants before we set off for others. They draw inspiration from science fiction, popular culture, and Indigenous knowledge, among other sources, to sketch out these alternative visions of an off-Earth future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mandel sees hope for this future in post-scarcity political theories. She cites various attempts to anticipate the needs of future generations—ideas found in the work of the social theorist Aaron Benanav, or in the values expressed by the Green New Deal, or in the fictional Ministry for the Future imagined by Kim Stanley Robinson in his 2020 novel of the same name. Whatever you think of the controversial 2025 book &lt;em&gt;Abundance&lt;/em&gt;, by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, it is also appealing to the same demand for a post-scarcity road map.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To that end, Mandel envisions “the creation of a governing body that would require that techno-scientific plans, especially those with a global reach, take into consideration multigenerational impacts and multigenerational voices.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Rubenstein, religion is the poison, but it may also offer the cure.

Agents4Science is a one-day online event that will encompass all areas of science, from physics to medicine. All of the work shared will have been researched, written, and reviewed primarily by AI, and will be presented using text-to-speech technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The conference is the brainchild of Stanford computer scientist James Zou, who studies how humans and AI can best work together. Artificial intelligence has already provided many useful tools for scientists, like DeepMind’s AlphaFold, which helps simulate proteins that are difficult to make physically. More recently, though, progress in large language models and reasoning-enabled AI has advanced the idea that AI can work more or less as autonomously as scientists themselves—proposing hypotheses, running simulations, and designing experiments on their own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="James Zou" class="wp-image-1122363" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/photo_highres_Courtesy.jpg?w=400" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;James Zou's Agents4Science conference will use text-to-speech to present the work of the AI researchers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF JAMES ZOU&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;That idea is not without its detractors. Among other issues, many feel AI is not capable of the creative thought needed in research, makes too many mistakes and hallucinations, and may limit opportunities for young researchers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a number of scientists and policymakers are very keen on the promise of AI scientists. The US government’s AI Action Plan describes the need to “invest in automated cloud-enabled labs for a range of scientific fields.” Some researchers think AI scientists could unlock scientific discoveries that humans could never find alone. For Zou, the proposition is simple: “AI agents are not limited in time. They could actually meet with us and work with us 24/7.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Last month, Zou published an article in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; with results obtained from his own group of autonomous AI workers. Spurred on by his success, he now wants to see what other AI scientists (that is, scientists that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; AI) can accomplish. He describes what a successful paper at Agents4Science will look like: “The AI should be the first author and do most of the work. Humans can be advisors.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A virtual lab staffed by AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a PhD student at Harvard in the early 2010s, Zou was so interested in AI’s potential for science that he took a year off from his computing research to work in a genomics lab, in a field that has greatly benefited from technology to map entire genomes. His time in so-called wet labs taught him how difficult it can be to work with experts in other fields. “They often have different languages,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Large language models, he believes, are better than people at deciphering and translating between subject-specific jargon. “They’ve read so broadly,” Zou says, that they can translate and generalize ideas across science very well. This idea inspired Zou to dream up what he calls the “Virtual Lab.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At a high level, the Virtual Lab would be a team of AI agents designed to mimic an actual university lab group. These agents would have various fields of expertise and could interact with different programs, like AlphaFold. Researchers could give one or more of these agents an agenda to work on, then open up the model to play back how the agents communicated to each other and determine which experiments people should pursue in a real-world trial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zou needed a (human) collaborator to help put this idea into action and tackle an actual research problem. Last year, he met John E. Pak, a research scientist at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.

But people won’t be left out of the loop entirely: A team of human experts, including a Nobel laureate in economics, will review the top papers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zou isn’t sure what will come of the conference, but he hopes there will be some gems among the hundreds of submissions he expects to receive across all domains. “There could be AI submissions that make interesting discoveries,” he says. “There could also be AI submissions that have a lot of interesting mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While Zou says the response to the conference has been positive, some scientists are less than impressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright has-text-align-right"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you get leaps of insight?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lisa Messeri&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lisa Messeri, an anthropologist of science at Yale University, has loads of questions about AI’s ability to review science: “How do you get leaps of insight? And what happens if a leap of insight comes onto the reviewer’s desk?” She doubts the conference will be able to give satisfying answers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, Messeri and her collaborator Molly Crockett investigated obstacles to using AI for science in another &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;article. They remain unconvinced of its ability to produce novel results, including those shared in Zou’s nanobodies paper.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’m the kind of scientist who is the target audience for these kinds of tools because I’m not a computer scientist … but I am doing computationally oriented work,” says Crockett, a cognitive scientist at Princeton University. “But I am at the same time very skeptical of the broader claims, especially with regard to how [AI scientists] might be able to simulate certain aspects of human thinking.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And they’re both skeptical of the value of using AI to do science if automation prevents human scientists from building up the expertise they need to oversee the bots. Instead, they advocate for involving experts from a wider range of disciplines to design more thoughtful experiments before trusting AI to perform and review science.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We need to be talking to epistemologists, philosophers of science, anthropologists of science, scholars who are thinking really hard about what knowledge is,” says Crockett.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Zou sees his conference as exactly the kind of experiment that could help push the field forward. When it comes to AI-generated science, he says, “there’s a lot of hype and a lot of anecdotes, but there’s really no systematic data.” Whether Agents4Science can provide that kind of data is an open question, but in October, the bots will at least try to show the world what they’ve got.&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In October, a new academic conference will debut that’s unlike any other. Agents4Science is a one-day online event that will encompass all areas of science, from physics to medicine. All of the work shared will have been researched, written, and reviewed primarily by AI, and will be presented using text-to-speech technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The conference is the brainchild of Stanford computer scientist James Zou, who studies how humans and AI can best work together. Artificial intelligence has already provided many useful tools for scientists, like DeepMind’s AlphaFold, which helps simulate proteins that are difficult to make physically. More recently, though, progress in large language models and reasoning-enabled AI has advanced the idea that AI can work more or less as autonomously as scientists themselves—proposing hypotheses, running simulations, and designing experiments on their own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="James Zou" class="wp-image-1122363" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/photo_highres_Courtesy.jpg?w=400" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;James Zou's Agents4Science conference will use text-to-speech to present the work of the AI researchers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF JAMES ZOU&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;That idea is not without its detractors. Among other issues, many feel AI is not capable of the creative thought needed in research, makes too many mistakes and hallucinations, and may limit opportunities for young researchers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a number of scientists and policymakers are very keen on the promise of AI scientists. The US government’s AI Action Plan describes the need to “invest in automated cloud-enabled labs for a range of scientific fields.” Some researchers think AI scientists could unlock scientific discoveries that humans could never find alone. For Zou, the proposition is simple: “AI agents are not limited in time. They could actually meet with us and work with us 24/7.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Last month, Zou published an article in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; with results obtained from his own group of autonomous AI workers. Spurred on by his success, he now wants to see what other AI scientists (that is, scientists that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; AI) can accomplish. He describes what a successful paper at Agents4Science will look like: “The AI should be the first author and do most of the work. Humans can be advisors.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A virtual lab staffed by AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a PhD student at Harvard in the early 2010s, Zou was so interested in AI’s potential for science that he took a year off from his computing research to work in a genomics lab, in a field that has greatly benefited from technology to map entire genomes. His time in so-called wet labs taught him how difficult it can be to work with experts in other fields. “They often have different languages,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Large language models, he believes, are better than people at deciphering and translating between subject-specific jargon. “They’ve read so broadly,” Zou says, that they can translate and generalize ideas across science very well. This idea inspired Zou to dream up what he calls the “Virtual Lab.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At a high level, the Virtual Lab would be a team of AI agents designed to mimic an actual university lab group. These agents would have various fields of expertise and could interact with different programs, like AlphaFold. Researchers could give one or more of these agents an agenda to work on, then open up the model to play back how the agents communicated to each other and determine which experiments people should pursue in a real-world trial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zou needed a (human) collaborator to help put this idea into action and tackle an actual research problem. Last year, he met John E. Pak, a research scientist at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Pak, who shares Zou’s interest in using AI for science, agreed to make the Virtual Lab with him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pak would help set the topic, but both he and Zou wanted to see what approaches the Virtual Lab could come up with on its own. As a first project, they decided to focus on designing therapies for new covid-19 strains. With this goal in mind, Zou set off training five AI scientists (including ones trained to act like an immunologist, a computational biologist, and a principal investigator) with different objectives and programs at their disposal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Building these models took a few months, but Pak says they were very quick at designing candidates for therapies once the setup was complete: “I think it was a day or half a day, something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zou says the agents decided to study anti-covid nanobodies, a cousin of antibodies that are much smaller in size and less common in the wild. Zou was shocked, though, at the reason. He claims the models landed on nanobodies after making the connection that these smaller molecules would be well-suited to the limited computational resources the models were given. “It actually turned out to be a good decision, because the agents were able to design these nanobodies efficiently,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The nanobodies the models designed were genuinely new advances in science, and most were able to bind to the original covid-19 variant, according to the study. But Pak and Zou both admit that the main contribution of their article is really the Virtual Lab as a tool. Yi Shi, a pharmacologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the work but made some of the underlying nanobodies the Virtual Lab modified, agrees. He says he loves the Virtual Lab demonstration and that “the major novelty is the automation.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;accepted the article and fast-tracked it for publication preview—Zou knew leveraging AI agents for science was a hot area, and he wanted to be one of the first to test it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

In total, the median prompt—one that falls in the middle of the range of energy demand—consumes 0.24 watt-hours of electricity, the equivalent of running a standard microwave for about one second. The company also provided average estimates for the water consumption (five drops per query) and carbon emissions associated with a text prompt to Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the most transparent estimate yet from a Big Tech company with a popular AI product, and the report includes detailed information about how the company calculated its final estimate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, MIT Technology Review published a comprehensive series on AI and energy, at which time none of the major AI companies would reveal their per-prompt energy usage. Google’s new publication, at last, allows for a peek behind the curtain that researchers and analysts have long hoped for.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I gave the police access to my DNA—and maybe some of yours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, I added my DNA profile to a private genealogical database, FamilyTreeDNA, and clicked “Yes” to allow the police to search my genes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2018, police in California announced they’d caught the Golden State Killer, a man who had eluded capture for decades. Once the police had “matches” to a few relatives of the killer, they built a large family tree from which they plucked the likely suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process, called forensic investigative genetic genealogy, or FIGG, has since helped solve hundreds of murders and sexual assaults.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I wasn’t really driven by some urge to capture distantly related serial killers. Rather, my spit had a less gallant and more quarrelsome motive: to troll privacy advocates whose fears around DNA I think are overblown and unhelpful. By giving up my saliva for inspection, I was going against the view that a person’s DNA is the individualized, sacred text that privacy advocates sometimes claim.

There are obvious upsides to using this kind of technology: AI could help take the guesswork out of the judging technicalities. It could even help to eliminate biases, making the sport both more fair and more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, others fear AI judging will take away something that makes gymnastics special. Gymnastics is a subjective sport, like diving or dressage, and technology could eliminate the judges’ role in crafting a narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, AI has officially infiltrated the world of gymnastics.

In total, the median prompt—one that falls in the middle of the range of energy demand—consumes 0.24 watt-hours of electricity, the equivalent of running a standard microwave for about one second. The company also provided average estimates for the water consumption (five drops per query) and carbon emissions associated with a text prompt to Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the most transparent estimate yet from a Big Tech company with a popular AI product, and the report includes detailed information about how the company calculated its final estimate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, MIT Technology Review published a comprehensive series on AI and energy, at which time none of the major AI companies would reveal their per-prompt energy usage. Google’s new publication, at last, allows for a peek behind the curtain that researchers and analysts have long hoped for.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I gave the police access to my DNA—and maybe some of yours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, I added my DNA profile to a private genealogical database, FamilyTreeDNA, and clicked “Yes” to allow the police to search my genes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2018, police in California announced they’d caught the Golden State Killer, a man who had eluded capture for decades. Once the police had “matches” to a few relatives of the killer, they built a large family tree from which they plucked the likely suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process, called forensic investigative genetic genealogy, or FIGG, has since helped solve hundreds of murders and sexual assaults.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I wasn’t really driven by some urge to capture distantly related serial killers. Rather, my spit had a less gallant and more quarrelsome motive: to troll privacy advocates whose fears around DNA I think are overblown and unhelpful. By giving up my saliva for inspection, I was going against the view that a person’s DNA is the individualized, sacred text that privacy advocates sometimes claim.

 &lt;p&gt;In October, a new academic conference will debut that’s unlike any other. All of the work shared at Agents4Science will have been researched, written, and reviewed primarily by AI, and will be presented using text-to-speech technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That idea is not without its detractors. Among other issues, many feel AI is not capable of the creative thought needed in research, makes too many mistakes and hallucinations, and may limit opportunities for young researchers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a number of scientists and policymakers are very keen on the promise of AI scientists—and some even think they could unlock scientific discoveries that humans could never find alone.

It’s also an active donor to projects under the CNCF’s oversight, including KubeEdge, Karmada, and Kuasar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s offerings include container products like CCE Turbo, CCE Autopilot, the distributed cloud-native service UCS, and its Cloud Container Instance (CCI).

As a key contributor to a major industry initiative, James is acutely aware of the pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the work of a wonderful group of folks I am a part of – the ’OWASP Top 10 for GenAI’ as a foundational way of understanding vulnerabilities that GenAI can introduce,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond specific vulnerabilities, James points at three fundamental trade-offs that business leaders must confront:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accepting the risk that comes with the creative but often unpredictable nature of generative AI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The loss of transparency in how AI reaches its conclusions, a problem that only grows as the models become more complex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The danger of poorly judging the real return on investment for any AI project, where the hype can easily lead to overestimating the benefits or underestimating the effort required in such a fast-moving field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build a better cybersecurity posture in the AI era, you have to understand your attacker. This is where James’ deep expertise comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is actually my particular expertise – I have a cyber threat intelligence background and have conducted and documented extensive research into threat actor’s interest, use, and development of AI,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James actively tracks adversary chatter and tool development through open-source channels and her own automated collections from the dark web, sharing her findings on her cybershujin GitHub. Her work also involves getting her own hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As the lead for the Prompt Injection entry for OWASP, and co-author of the Guide to Red Teaming GenAI, I also spend time developing adversarial input techniques myself and maintain a network of experts also in this field,” James adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what does this all mean for the future of the industry? For James, the path forward is clear. She points to a fascinating parallel she discovered years ago: “The cyber threat intelligence lifecycle is almost identical to the data science lifecycle foundational to AI ML systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This alignment is a massive opportunity. “Without a doubt, in terms of the datasets we can operate with, defenders have a unique chance to capitalise on the power of intelligence data sharing and AI,” she asserts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her final message offers both encouragement and a warning for her peers in the cybersecurity world: “Data science and AI will be a part of every cybersecurity professional’s life moving forward, embrace it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel James will be sharing her insights at this year’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; in Amsterdam on 24-25 September 2025.

&lt;p&gt;A key forum for processor and system architects from industry and academia, Hot Chips — running Aug. 24-26 at Stanford University — showcases the latest innovations poised to advance AI factories and drive revenue for the trillion-dollar data center computing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conference, NVIDIA will join industry leaders including Google and Microsoft in a “tutorial” session — taking place on Sunday, Aug. 24 — that discusses designing rack-scale architecture for data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, NVIDIA experts will present at four sessions and one tutorial detailing how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA networking, including the NVIDIA ConnectX-8 SuperNIC, delivers AI reasoning at rack- and data-center scale. &lt;em&gt;(Featuring Idan Burstein, principal architect of network adapters and systems-on-a-chip at NVIDIA)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural rendering advancements and massive leaps in inference — powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, including the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU — provide next-level graphics and simulation capabilities. &lt;em&gt;(Featuring Marc Blackstein, senior director of architecture at NVIDIA)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-packaged optics (CPO) switches with integrated silicon photonics — built with light-speed fiber rather than copper wiring to send information quicker and using less power — enable efficient, high-performance, gigawatt-scale AI factories. The talk will also highlight NVIDIA Spectrum-XGS Ethernet, a new scale-across technology for unifying distributed data centers into AI super-factories. &lt;em&gt;(Featuring Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of networking at NVIDIA)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The NVIDIA GB10 Superchip serves as the engine within the NVIDIA DGX Spark desktop supercomputer. &lt;em&gt;(Featuring Andi Skende, senior distinguished engineer at NVIDIA)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all part of how NVIDIA’s latest technologies are accelerating inference to drive AI innovation everywhere, at every scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NVIDIA Networking Fosters AI Innovation at Scale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI reasoning — when artificial intelligence systems can analyze and solve complex problems through multiple AI inference passes — requires rack-scale performance to deliver optimal user experiences efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In data centers powering today’s AI workloads, networking acts as the central nervous system, connecting all the components — servers, storage devices and other hardware — into a single, cohesive, powerful computing unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_84155"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-84155 size-full" height="171" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/two-nvidia-connectx08-supernic.png" width="303" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84155"&gt;NVIDIA ConnectX-8 SuperNIC&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burstein’s Hot Chips session will dive into how NVIDIA networking technologies — particularly NVIDIA ConnectX-8 SuperNICs — enable high-speed, low-latency, multi-GPU communication to deliver market-leading AI reasoning performance at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the NVIDIA networking platform, NVIDIA NVLink, NVLink Switch and NVLink Fusion deliver scale-up connectivity — linking GPUs and compute elements within and across servers for ultra low-latency, high-bandwidth data exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet provides the scale-out fabric to connect entire clusters, rapidly streaming massive datasets into AI models and orchestrating GPU-to-GPU communication across the data center. Spectrum-XGS Ethernet scale-across technology extends the extreme performance and scale of Spectrum-X Ethernet to interconnect multiple, distributed data centers to form AI super-factories capable of giga-scale intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_84152"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-84152 size-full" height="235" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/three-distributed-ai-data-centers.png" width="423" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84152"&gt;Connecting distributed AI data centers with NVIDIA Spectrum-XGS Ethernet.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Spectrum-X Ethernet, CPO switches push the limits of performance and efficiency for AI infrastructure at scale, and will be covered in detail by Shainer in his talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 — an exascale computer in a single rack — features 36 NVIDIA GB200 Superchips, each containing two NVIDIA B200 GPUs and an NVIDIA Grace CPU, interconnected by the largest NVLink domain ever offered, with NVLink Switch providing 130 terabytes per second of low-latency GPU communications for AI and high-performance computing workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_84143"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-84143 size-full" height="159" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/four-rack-scale-system.png" width="282" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84143"&gt;An NVIDIA rack-scale system.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built with the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, GB200 NVL72 systems deliver massive leaps in reasoning inference performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NVIDIA Blackwell and CUDA Bring AI to Millions of Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU — also powered by Blackwell and to be covered in Blackstein’s talk — doubles performance in today’s games with NVIDIA DLSS 4 technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_84140"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-84140 size-full" height="144" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/five-geforce.jpg" width="256" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84140"&gt;NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also add neural rendering features for games to deliver up to 10x performance, 10x footprint amplification and a 10x reduction in design cycles,&amp;nbsp; helping enhance realism in computer graphics and simulation. This offers smooth, responsive visual experiences at low energy consumption and improves the lifelike simulation of characters and effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA CUDA, the world’s most widely available computing infrastructure, lets users deploy and run AI models using NVIDIA Blackwell anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of millions of GPUs run CUDA across the globe, from NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems to GeForce RTX– and NVIDIA RTX PRO-powered PCs and workstations, with NVIDIA DGX Spark powered by NVIDIA GB10 — discussed in Skende’s session — coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Algorithms to AI Supercomputers — Optimized for LLMs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_84149"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-84149 size-full" height="164" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/six-dgx-spark.png" width="292" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84149"&gt;NVIDIA DGX Spark&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delivering powerful performance and capabilities in a compact package, DGX Spark lets developers, researchers, data scientists and students push the boundaries of generative AI right at their desktops, and accelerate workloads across industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, DGX Spark brings support for NVFP4, a low-precision numerical format to enable efficient agentic AI inference, particularly of large language models (LLMs). Learn more about NVFP4 in this NVIDIA Technical Blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open-Source Collaborations Propel Inference Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA accelerates several open-source libraries and frameworks to accelerate and optimize AI workloads for LLMs and distributed inference. These include NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, NVIDIA Dynamo, TileIR, Cutlass, the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library and NIX — which are integrated into millions of workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing developers to build with their framework of choice, NVIDIA has collaborated with top open framework providers to offer model optimizations for FlashInfer, PyTorch, SGLang, vLLM and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, NVIDIA NIM microservices are available for popular open models like OpenAI’s gpt-oss and Llama 4, &amp;nbsp;making it easy for developers to operate managed application programming interfaces with the flexibility and security of self-hosting models on their preferred infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about the latest advancements in inference and accelerated computing by joining &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;NVIDIA at Hot Chips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 — an exascale computer in a single rack — features 36 NVIDIA GB200 Superchips, each containing two NVIDIA B200 GPUs and an NVIDIA Grace CPU, interconnected by the largest NVLink domain ever offered, with NVLink Switch providing 130 terabytes per second of low-latency GPU communications for AI and high-performance computing workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_84143"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-84143 size-full" height="159" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/four-rack-scale-system.png" width="282" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84143"&gt;An NVIDIA rack-scale system.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built with the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, GB200 NVL72 systems deliver massive leaps in reasoning inference performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NVIDIA Blackwell and CUDA Bring AI to Millions of Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU — also powered by Blackwell and to be covered in Blackstein’s talk — doubles performance in today’s games with NVIDIA DLSS 4 technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_84140"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-84140 size-full" height="144" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/five-geforce.jpg" width="256" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84140"&gt;NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also add neural rendering features for games to deliver up to 10x performance, 10x footprint amplification and a 10x reduction in design cycles,&amp;nbsp; helping enhance realism in computer graphics and simulation. This offers smooth, responsive visual experiences at low energy consumption and improves the lifelike simulation of characters and effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA CUDA, the world’s most widely available computing infrastructure, lets users deploy and run AI models using NVIDIA Blackwell anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of millions of GPUs run CUDA across the globe, from NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems to GeForce RTX– and NVIDIA RTX PRO-powered PCs and workstations, with NVIDIA DGX Spark powered by NVIDIA GB10 — discussed in Skende’s session — coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Algorithms to AI Supercomputers — Optimized for LLMs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_84149"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-84149 size-full" height="164" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/six-dgx-spark.png" width="292" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84149"&gt;NVIDIA DGX Spark&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delivering powerful performance and capabilities in a compact package, DGX Spark lets developers, researchers, data scientists and students push the boundaries of generative AI right at their desktops, and accelerate workloads across industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, DGX Spark brings support for NVFP4, a low-precision numerical format to enable efficient agentic AI inference, particularly of large language models (LLMs). Learn more about NVFP4 in this NVIDIA Technical Blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open-Source Collaborations Propel Inference Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA accelerates several open-source libraries and frameworks to accelerate and optimize AI workloads for LLMs and distributed inference. These include NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, NVIDIA Dynamo, TileIR, Cutlass, the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library and NIX — which are integrated into millions of workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing developers to build with their framework of choice, NVIDIA has collaborated with top open framework providers to offer model optimizations for FlashInfer, PyTorch, SGLang, vLLM and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, NVIDIA NIM microservices are available for popular open models like OpenAI’s gpt-oss and Llama 4, &amp;nbsp;making it easy for developers to operate managed application programming interfaces with the flexibility and security of self-hosting models on their preferred infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about the latest advancements in inference and accelerated computing by joining &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;NVIDIA at Hot Chips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new feature allows Workspace users to initiate a video edit using Vids directly from the Google Drive interface. Now, while previewing a video in Drive, users will see an “Open” button in the top right corner that opens the video in the Vids app. Vids will automatically launch the video file, allowing further edits such as trimming the clip or incorporating music and text.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3039086" height="425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/edit-drive-videos-in-vids.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This new shortcut, which is activated by default, suggests that the company is integrating the app more closely with Google’s Workspace suite. Launched last year, Vids aims to streamline video production, including the ability to generate videos from basic text prompts, automatically craft scripts, rearrange video clips, add transitions, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This comes on the heels of the company introducing another Gemini AI feature for Workspace users in May, which allows them to use AI to summarize video files stored in Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia has instructed its component suppliers to stop production related to its H20 AI chip, according to The Information.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The production halt comes after Beijing reportedly warned Chinese companies against using these chips because of potential security issues and fears of backdoors that would give the U.S. access to sensitive data. China’s government is urging companies to use domestic chips instead, The Information reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This comes a month after companies including Nvidia were given the green light to start selling its AI chips designed for China’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Nvidia spokesperson sent TechCrunch the following statement, “We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions. Cybersecurity is critically important to us. NVIDIA does not have ‘backdoors’ in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them. The market can use the H20 with confidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
