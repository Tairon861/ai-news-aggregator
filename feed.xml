The feature is now available to all logged-in users after a short pilot earlier this month, and it shifts ChatGPT from a mostly one-on-one tool to something that supports small-group collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI frames the update as a simple way to plan daily tasks with friends, family members, or coworkers, like setting up a dinner, preparing a trip, or drafting an outline together. But the feature may have broader value for work teams that already use ChatGPT for brainstorming, research, and early project discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How the feature works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group chat begins when you select the “people” icon in the top-right corner of the ChatGPT app. The app creates a new shared space by copying your current conversation, and you can invite others by sending a link. That link can be shared again, allowing people to bring more participants into the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time a user joins or creates a group chat, ChatGPT asks them to set a name, username, and profile photo so the group can identify who is talking. OpenAI says ChatGPT has been trained to “go along with the flow of the conversation,” deciding when to respond and when to stay silent. If someone wants ChatGPT to add something directly, they can mention “ChatGPT” in their message. The model can also react with emojis and use profile photos when creating personalised images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A settings panel in the top-right corner of the screen lets users add or remove people, mute notifications, or provide custom instructions to ChatGPT. OpenAI says the model will not use memories from personal chats inside group conversations and will not create new memories based on group activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group chats run on GPT-5.1 Auto, which chooses the response model based on the prompt and the options available to the user. Rate limits only apply when ChatGPT sends a message. The rollout follows the recent release of the GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking models, and earlier launch Sora, a social app for creating short videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How group chats may support real collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the consumer pitch focuses on casual planning, many of the challenges companies face stem from how people share ideas, review drafts, and coordinate in different roles. Group chats may help reduce some of that friction by giving teams a single space to talk with ChatGPT in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aligning cross-functional teams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large organisations work to keep product, design, engineering, and marketing teams aligned, especially at the start of a project. Early ideas can scattered in email threads and chat apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a group chat, everyone can contribute in one place. If someone joins late or misses part of the discussion, ChatGPT can summarise the thread, identify open questions, or help turn the group’s notes into a structured plan. This helps teams move from early debate to action without losing context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoother review cycles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drafts usually go through long review loops that involve different people using different channels. Comments come in at different times, and it becomes hard to track which version is the current one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a group chat, the team can react to the same draft together. ChatGPT can rewrite passages, compare alternate versions, or help clarify feedback, which may speed up work for teams dealing with tight deadlines or frequent updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster onboarding for new teammates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New team members joining projects that have months of history behind them have to spend time tracking down old messages and files to understand how decisions were made. A manager could add a new teammate to an existing group chat and ask ChatGPT to summarise past discussions, highlight key choices, and show which tasks remain open, reducing the time needed for onboarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinating shared tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine coordination – like preparing an internal workshop, drafting a customer email, or planning an event – often gets slowed down by back-and-forth messages that stretch days. In a group chat, anyone can ask ChatGPT to create a schedule, rewrite a message, build a checklist, or compare options. The group can then adjust the details together without starting from scratch each time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organising creative feedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creative work can stall when feedback comes in messy or conflicting forms. Designers, writers, and analysts often get comments spread in different channels. Group chats keep all feedback in one place. ChatGPT can group comments into themes, point out contradictions, or propose drafts that reflect what the team wants. The can help reduce rework and steer the group toward a shared direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A broader shift in how teams use ChatGPT&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of group chats arrives during a period when many companies are testing ways to bring AI deeper into their workflows. ChatGPT already helps many users draft, summarise, and revise work. Giving teams a shared space may change how early project conversations take shape, especially for organisations experimenting with AI-supported planning and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature does not replace human coordination, but it introduces a shared surface where people can talk to each other and bring ChatGPT into the discussion when needed. For teams dealing with scattered inputs, slow reviews, or rapid context-switching, group chats may offer a simpler way to keep projects moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Solen Feyissa)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The mornings are frosty, the wind is biting, and it’s already dark by the time I pick my kids up from school. The darkness in particular has got me thinking about vitamin D, a.k.a. the sunshine vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At a checkup a few years ago, a doctor told me I was deficient in vitamin D. But he wouldn’t write me a prescription for supplements, simply because, as he put it, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; in the UK is deficient. Putting the entire population on vitamin D supplements would be too expensive for the country’s national health service, he told me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But supplementation—whether covered by a health-care provider or not—can be important.&lt;/strong&gt; As those of us living in the Northern Hemisphere spend fewer of our waking hours in sunlight, let’s consider the importance of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yes, it is important for bone health. But recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into how the vitamin might influence other parts of our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D was discovered just over 100 years ago,&lt;/strong&gt; when health professionals were looking for ways to treat what was then called “the English disease.” Today, we know that rickets, a weakening of bones in children, is caused by vitamin D deficiency. And vitamin D is best known for its importance in bone health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s because it helps our bodies absorb calcium. Our bones are continually being broken down and rebuilt, and they need calcium for that rebuilding process. Without enough calcium, bones can become weak and brittle. (Depressingly, rickets is still a global health issue, which is why there is&amp;nbsp;global consensus that infants should receive a vitamin D supplement at least until they are one year old.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In the decades since then, scientists have learned that vitamin D has effects beyond our bones. There’s some evidence to suggest, for example, that being deficient in vitamin D puts people at risk of high blood pressure. Daily or weekly supplements&amp;nbsp;can help those individuals lower their blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A vitamin D deficiency has also been linked to&amp;nbsp;a greater risk of “cardiovascular events” like heart attacks, although it’s not clear whether supplements can reduce this risk; the evidence is pretty mixed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vitamin D appears to influence our immune health, too.&amp;nbsp;Studies&amp;nbsp;have found a link between low vitamin D levels and incidence of the common cold, for example. And other&amp;nbsp;research has shown that vitamin D supplements can influence the way our genes make proteins that play important roles in the way our immune systems work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We don’t yet know exactly how these relationships work, however. And, unfortunately, a recent&amp;nbsp;study that assessed the results of 37 clinical trials found that overall, vitamin D supplements aren’t likely to stop you from getting an “acute respiratory infection.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other studies have linked vitamin D levels to mental health, pregnancy outcomes, and even how long people survive after a cancer diagnosis.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s tantalizing to imagine that a cheap supplement could benefit so many aspects of our health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But, as you might have gathered if you’ve got this far, we’re not quite there yet. The evidence on the effects of vitamin D supplementation for those various conditions is mixed at best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fairness to researchers, it can be difficult to run a randomized clinical trial for vitamin D supplements. That’s because most of us get the bulk of our vitamin D from sunlight. Our skin converts UVB rays into a form of the vitamin that our bodies can use. We get it in our diets, too, but not much. (The main sources are oily fish, egg yolks, mushrooms, and some fortified cereals and milk alternatives.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The standard way to measure a person’s vitamin D status is to look at blood levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D), which is formed when the liver metabolizes vitamin D. But not everyone can agree on what the “ideal” level is.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Even if everyone did agree on a figure, it isn’t obvious how much vitamin D a person would need to consume to reach this target, or how much sunlight exposure it would take. One complicating factor is that people respond to UV rays in different ways—a lot of that can depend on how much melanin is in your skin. Similarly, if you’re sitting down to a meal of oily fish and mushrooms and washing it down with a glass of fortified milk, it’s hard to know how much more you might need.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is more consensus on the definition of vitamin D &lt;em&gt;deficiency&lt;/em&gt;, though.&lt;/strong&gt; (It’s a blood level below 30 nanomoles per liter, in case you were wondering.) And until we know more about what vitamin D is doing in our bodies, our focus should be on avoiding that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For me, that means topping up with a supplement. The UK government&amp;nbsp;advises everyone in the country to take a 10-microgram vitamin D supplement over autumn and winter. That advice doesn’t factor in my age, my blood levels, or the amount of melanin in my skin. But it’s all I’ve got for now.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1800745798.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has started to get really wintry here in London over the last few days.
