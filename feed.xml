On its first day, Sora saw 56,000 downloads, and is now ranked as the No. 3 Top Overall app on Apple’s U.S. App Store, according to new data from app intelligence provider Appfigures. On Friday, October 3, it became the No. 1 app on the U.S. App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That puts it ahead of Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm estimates Sora’s iOS app pulled in a total of 164,000 installs during its first two days, September 30 and October 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The day-one figure also puts Sora’s debut ahead of the performance of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and puts it on par with xAI’s Grok launch. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we’ll admit. It’s possible the new video app could have attracted even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; installs if it were open to all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite this restriction, it’s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers’ hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the chagrin of some at OpenAI, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity. But who’s to say that humanity isn’t benefiting from deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asking, “Are my piggies enjoying their slop?”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To compare Sora’s early success to other AI apps, Appfigures had to run an analysis that only looked at the other AI apps’ U.S. and Canadian downloads. That’s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and limited itself to U.S. users at the time, while Grok limited its iOS-only release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn’t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought its Claude app to iOS last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app’s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively. Sora tied with Grok for day-one installs, at 56,000. And it easily beat out the launches from AI apps Claude and Copilot. The former pulled in 21,000 day-one downloads, while the latter only saw 7,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sora also hit the U.S. App Store’s top charts, becoming the No. 3 overall top app by day two. For comparison, ChatGPT reached No. 1 on its second day, while Grok was No. 4, Gemini was No. 6, Copilot was No. 19, and Claude was No. 78. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The day-one figure also puts Sora’s debut ahead of the performance of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and puts it on par with xAI’s Grok launch. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we’ll admit. It’s possible the new video app could have attracted even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; installs if it were open to all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite this restriction, it’s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers’ hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the chagrin of some at OpenAI, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity. But who’s to say that humanity isn’t benefiting from deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asking, “Are my piggies enjoying their slop?”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To compare Sora’s early success to other AI apps, Appfigures had to run an analysis that only looked at the other AI apps’ U.S. and Canadian downloads. That’s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and limited itself to U.S. users at the time, while Grok limited its iOS-only release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn’t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought its Claude app to iOS last year. &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app’s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively. Sora tied with Grok for day-one installs, at 56,000. And it easily beat out the launches from AI apps Claude and Copilot. The former pulled in 21,000 day-one downloads, while the latter only saw 7,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sora also hit the U.S. App Store’s top charts, becoming the No. 3 overall top app by day two. For comparison, ChatGPT reached No. 1 on its second day, while Grok was No. 4, Gemini was No. 6, Copilot was No. 19, and Claude was No. 78. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;As generative AI has taken off since ChatGPT's debut, inspiring hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and infrastructure developments, the top question on many people's minds has been: Is generative AI a bubble, and if so, when will it pop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help us potentially answer that question, I'll be hosting a live conversation with prominent AI critic Ed Zitron on October 7 at 3:30 pm ET as part of the Ars Live series. As Ars Technica's senior AI reporter, I've been tracking both the explosive growth of this industry and the mounting skepticism about its sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch the discussion live on YouTube when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zitron is the host of the &lt;em&gt;Better Offline&lt;/em&gt; podcast and CEO of EZPR, a media relations company. He writes the newsletter Where's Your Ed At, where he frequently dissects OpenAI's finances and questions the actual utility of current AI products. His recent posts have examined whether companies are losing money on AI investments, the economics of GPU rentals, OpenAI's trillion-dollar funding needs, and what he calls "The Subprime AI Crisis."&lt;/p&gt;

We'll also discuss what it's like to be a prominent and sometimes controversial AI critic amid the drumbeat of AI mania in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ed and I don't see eye to eye on everything, his sharp criticism of the AI industry's excesses should make for an engaging discussion about one of tech's most consequential questions right now.&lt;/p&gt;

On Friday, Supabase announced that it raised a fresh $100 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation, led by Accel and Peak XV. This is just four months after closing its $200 million Series D at a $2 billion valuation, led by Accel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And that Series D was just seven months after raising an $80 million Series C led by Sequoia spinoff Peak XV and David Sacks’ Craft Ventures at an undisclosed valuation. PitchBook estimated Supabase was valued at around $765 million in that deal, post-money.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So that’s $380 million raised in a year and a more than 500% valuation step up, assuming PitchBook’s estimates of the Series C valuation are in the ballpark. Supabase has now raised a total of $500 million, it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open source database service Supabase was founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson (pictured above), a few years before the LLM-powered vibe-coding craze spawned. It was originally a Y Combinator startup that offered developers a Postgres-based open source alternative to Google’s Firebase. Firebase is a database that was also designed to power AI apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Supabase combines Postgres with other enterprise-grade open source tools for features like authentication, auto-generated APIs, file storage, and a vector toolkit (necessary for many AI apps).&amp;nbsp;It simplified the difficult parts of setting up a database down to a few button clicks. Consequently, it became a popular back end for vibe-coding tools — which write apps with natural language prompts —&amp;nbsp;like fast-growing Lovable and Bolt. It is increasingly used as the database of choice for Figma and other uber popular AI coding tools like Replit, Cursor, and Claude Code, it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Interestingly, because Supabase is open source and supported by a community of developers — claiming 4 million developers as users — it is allowing community members to also buy stock as part of this Series E funding, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Supabase-Ant-Wilson-Paul-Copplestone.jpg?w=1067" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;It’s been a whirlwind year for the vibe-coding world’s database of choice: Supabase. On Friday, Supabase announced that it raised a fresh $100 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation, led by Accel and Peak XV. This is just four months after closing its $200 million Series D at a $2 billion valuation, led by Accel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And that Series D was just seven months after raising an $80 million Series C led by Sequoia spinoff Peak XV and David Sacks’ Craft Ventures at an undisclosed valuation. PitchBook estimated Supabase was valued at around $765 million in that deal, post-money.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So that’s $380 million raised in a year and a more than 500% valuation step up, assuming PitchBook’s estimates of the Series C valuation are in the ballpark. Supabase has now raised a total of $500 million, it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open source database service Supabase was founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson (pictured above), a few years before the LLM-powered vibe-coding craze spawned. It was originally a Y Combinator startup that offered developers a Postgres-based open source alternative to Google’s Firebase. Firebase is a database that was also designed to power AI apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Supabase combines Postgres with other enterprise-grade open source tools for features like authentication, auto-generated APIs, file storage, and a vector toolkit (necessary for many AI apps).&amp;nbsp;It simplified the difficult parts of setting up a database down to a few button clicks. Consequently, it became a popular back end for vibe-coding tools — which write apps with natural language prompts —&amp;nbsp;like fast-growing Lovable and Bolt. It is increasingly used as the database of choice for Figma and other uber popular AI coding tools like Replit, Cursor, and Claude Code, it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Interestingly, because Supabase is open source and supported by a community of developers — claiming 4 million developers as users — it is allowing community members to also buy stock as part of this Series E funding, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

The company is seemingly experimenting with a new user interface that would shift the app from having a chatbot-style look and feel to one offering a scrollable feed with suggested prompts accompanied by eye-catching photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The changes were spotted in a recent version of the Gemini Android app by the news site Android Authority but are not yet live to the public. Instead, by looking into the app’s code, a reverse engineer enabled the app’s new home screen. Here, shortcut buttons to do things like “Create Image” or access “Deep Research” were moved up on the screen and were then followed by the scrollable feed.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson said there’s no announcement to be made “just yet.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the examples shown, prompts suggested fun things to do with your photos, like “Teleport me to deep space,” “Give me a vintage or grunge look,” or “Turn my drawing into a storybook,” among other things. Other prompts featuring a colorful background offered different ideas of things to ask Gemini, or suggested use cases. For instance, one prompt idea said “Brainstorm out loud with Live,” and another said “Send me a daily news roundup.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshots showing gemini's new interface with colorful prompts and images" class="wp-image-3054171" height="499" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Android Authority &lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;(opens in a new window)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The idea is to inspire users with more specific suggestions of how to use Gemini’s AI, rather than leaving them to figure out the AI chatbot’s capabilities on their own. However, the revamp would also make Gemini’s app more visually appealing and engaging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If pushed live to the public, it could also help Google better challenge rival OpenAI, whose ChatGPT app is still fairly minimalist as it launches to a largely blank screen. Plus, it could capitalize on consumer demand for Google’s newer AI image model, Nano Banana, which helped the Gemini app climb the App Store’s Top Charts in September; it became the No. 1 app as of September 12 and held that ranking until being booted by Sora.&lt;/p&gt;

The company says more than 1,500 people are scheduled to convene at Fort Mason in San Francisco for OpenAI’s “biggest event yet,” which features announcements, keynotes from OpenAI executives, and a fireside chat between CEO Sam Altman and longtime Apple designer Jony Ive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;From the sound of it, DevDay 2025 is shaping up to be a grand display of OpenAI’s rising dominance in Silicon Valley against giants like Apple, Google, and Meta. OpenAI is currently building an AI device, a social media app, and an AI-powered browser to take on Chrome. In other words, OpenAI has a lot more going on than it did during its first DevDay in 2023, when it mostly just had ChatGPT and an API business for developers to access its models.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, OpenAI faces more competition than ever in the bid to win over developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the last year, Anthropic’s and Google’s AI models have become increasingly capable for coding tasks and web design. OpenAI has been forced to release better AI models at lower prices to remain in the race. In the background, Meta has built up an impressive roster of AI talent in its new group, Meta Superintelligence Labs, which could become another threat to OpenAI in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled at its first DevDay in 2023 a new AI model, GPT-4 Turbo, and Altman shared his vision for a marketplace of AI agents called the GPT Store. Altman was ousted as CEO days later — only to return after a dramatic weekend of negotiations. In 2024, OpenAI responded with a more subdued conference, announcing some meaningful developer upgrades, such as an API for AI voice applications, but not much else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nothing is confirmed to launch at DevDay 2025, stoking plenty of rumors. Perhaps OpenAI will finally unveil the AI-powered browser it’s been working on, or maybe give an update on the AI device it’s building with Ive and former Apple executives. It’s also possible there could be some updates related to the GPT Store, which OpenAI has barely discussed since it launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch will be on the ground in San Francisco covering the event live, so you can check back here for all the news. Here’s what you need to know about OpenAI’s DevDay, and how to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DevDay 2025 kicks off at 10 a.m. PT October 6 with an opening keynote from Altman, in which he’s scheduled to unveil “announcements, live demos, and a vision of how developers are reshaping the future with AI.” The keynote will last roughly one hour and will be livestreamed on OpenAI’s YouTube page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s the only event that will be livestreamed for remote attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For in-person attendees, there will be onstage presentations and talks from Cursor CEO Michael Truell, San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, and Andreessen Horowitz investing partner Kimberly Tan, among others. Several OpenAI employees will also give speeches about their work, including model behavior researcher Laurentia Romaniuk and Codex lead Alexander Embiricos.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s also supposed to be a series of AI-powered sideshows at DevDay 2025. One of them is “Sora Cinema,” which is described as a “cozy mini-theater with popcorn” featuring short films generated by OpenAI’s video model, Sora. There’s also supposed to be a phone booth with a “living portrait” of the famed computer scientist Alan Turing “that speaks back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Later in the afternoon, there will be two big events to cap off DevDay. These last two events won’t be livestreamed, but they will be posted on YouTube later that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At 3:15 p.m. PT, there will be a “Developer State of the Union” with OpenAI president Greg Brockman and Olivier Godement, who heads up product for the OpenAI Platform. The two OpenAI executives are slated to “demo new capabilities” and share what’s ahead for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, at 4:15 p.m. PT, Altman and Ive will give a “Closing Fireside Chat” to discuss the “craft of building in the age of AI.” That conversation will last about 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 10/3/25: OpenAI updated the attendee list for DevDay 2025.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Later in the afternoon, there will be two big events to cap off DevDay. These last two events won’t be livestreamed, but they will be posted on YouTube later that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At 3:15 p.m. PT, there will be a “Developer State of the Union” with OpenAI president Greg Brockman and Olivier Godement, who heads up product for the OpenAI Platform. The two OpenAI executives are slated to “demo new capabilities” and share what’s ahead for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, at 4:15 p.m. PT, Altman and Ive will give a “Closing Fireside Chat” to discuss the “craft of building in the age of AI.” That conversation will last about 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 10/3/25: OpenAI updated the attendee list for DevDay 2025. This story has been updated to reflect the change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/what-to-expect-at-openais-devday-2025-and-how-to-watch-it/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 19:36:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] A biological 0-day?

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, a team of researchers led by Microsoft announced that they had discovered, and possibly patched, what they're terming a biological zero-day—an unrecognized security hole in a system that protects us from biological threats. The system at risk screens purchases of DNA sequences to determine when someone's ordering DNA that encodes a toxin or dangerous virus. But, the researchers argue, it has become increasingly vulnerable to missing a new threat: AI-designed toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How big of a threat is this? To understand, you have to know a bit more about both existing biosurveillance programs and the capabilities of AI-designed proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Catching the bad ones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological threats come in a variety of forms. Some are pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. Others are protein-based toxins, like the ricin that was sent to the White House in 2003. Still others are chemical toxins that are produced through enzymatic reactions, like the molecules associated with red tide. All of them get their start through the same fundamental biological process: DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then used to make proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several decades now, starting the process has been as easy as ordering the needed DNA sequence online from any of a number of companies, which will synthesize a requested sequence and ship it out. Recognizing the potential threat here, governments and industry have worked together to add a screening step to every order: the DNA sequence is scanned for its ability to encode parts of proteins or viruses considered threats. Any positives are then flagged for human intervention to evaluate whether they or the people ordering them truly represent a danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the list of proteins and the sophistication of the scanning have been continually updated in response to research progress over the years. For example, initial screening was done based on similarity to target DNA sequences. But there are many DNA sequences that can encode the same protein, so the screening algorithms have been adjusted accordingly, recognizing all the DNA variants that pose an identical threat.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The new work can be thought of as an extension of that threat. Not only can multiple DNA sequences encode the same protein; multiple proteins can perform the same function. To form a toxin, for example, typically requires the protein to adopt the correct three-dimensional structure, which brings a handful of critical amino acids within the protein into close proximity. Outside of those critical amino acids, however, things can often be quite flexible. Some amino acids may not matter at all; other locations in the protein could work with any positively charged amino acid, or any hydrophobic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, it could be extremely difficult (meaning time-consuming and expensive) to do the experiments that would tell you what sorts of changes a string of amino acids could tolerate while remaining functional. But the team behind the new analysis recognized that AI protein design tools have now gotten quite sophisticated and can predict when distantly related sequences can fold up into the same shape and catalyze the same reactions. The process is still error-prone, and you often have to test a dozen or more proposed proteins to get a working one, but it has produced some impressive successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the team developed a hypothesis to test: AI can take an existing toxin and design a protein with the same function that's distantly related enough that the screening programs do not detect orders for the DNA that encodes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The zero-day treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team started with a basic test: use AI tools to design variants of the toxin ricin, then test them against the software that is used to screen DNA orders. The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;"Taking inspiration from established cybersecurity processes for addressing such situations, we contacted the relevant bodies regarding the potential vulnerability, including the International Gene Synthesis Consortium and trusted colleagues in the protein design community as well as leads in biosecurity at the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, US National Institute of Standards and Technologies, US Department of Homeland Security, and US Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response," the authors report. "Outside of those bodies, details were kept confidential until a more comprehensive study could be performed in pursuit of potential mitigations and for 'patches'... to be developed and deployed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of that original test are being made available today as part of a much larger analysis that extends the approach to a large range of toxic proteins. Starting with 72 toxins, the researchers used three open source AI packages to generate a total of about 75,000 potential protein variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where things get a little complicated. Many of the AI-designed protein variants are going to end up being non-functional, either subtly or catastrophically failing to fold up into the correct configuration to create an active toxin. The only way to know which ones work is to make the proteins and test them biologically; most AI protein design efforts will make actual proteins from dozens to hundreds of the most promising-looking potential designs to find a handful that are active. But doing that for 75,000 designs is completely unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers used two software-based tools to evaluate each of the 75,000 designs. One of these focuses on the similarity between the overall predicted physical structure of the proteins, and another looks at the predicted differences between the positions of individual amino acids. Either way, they're a rough approximation of just how similar the proteins formed by two strings of amino acids should be. But they're definitely not a clear indicator of whether those two proteins would be equally functional.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, DNA sequences encoding all 75,000 designs were fed into the software that screens DNA orders for potential threats. One thing that was very clear is that there were huge variations in the ability of the four screening programs to flag these variant designs as threatening. Two of them seemed to do a pretty good job, one was mixed, and another let most of them through. Three of the software packages were updated in response to this performance, which significantly improved their ability to pick out variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a clear trend in all four screening packages: The closer the variant was to the original structurally, the more likely the package (both before and after the patches) was to be able to flag it as a threat. In all cases, there was also a cluster of variant designs that were unlikely to fold into a similar structure, and these generally weren't flagged as threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it's important to emphasize that this evaluation is based on predicted structures; "unlikely" to fold into a similar structure to the original toxin doesn't mean these proteins will be inactive as toxins. Functional proteins are probably going to be very rare among this group, but there may be a handful in there. That handful is also probably rare enough that you would have to order up and test far too many designs to find one that works, making this an impractical threat vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are also a handful of proteins that are very similar to the toxin structurally and not flagged by the software. For the three patched versions of the software, the ones that slip through the screening represent about 1 to 3 percent of the total in the "very similar" category. That's not great, but it's probably good enough that any group that tries to order up a toxin by this method would attract attention because they'd have to order over 50 just to have a good chance of finding one that slipped through, which would raise all sorts of red flags.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;One other notable result is that the designs that weren't flagged were mostly variants of just a handful of toxin proteins. So this is less of a general problem with the screening software and might be more of a small set of focused problems. Of note, one of the proteins that produced a lot of unflagged variants isn't toxic itself; instead, it's a co-factor necessary for the actual toxin to do its thing. As such, some of the screening software packages didn't even flag the original protein as dangerous, much less any of its variants. (For these reasons, the company that makes one of the better-performing software packages decided the threat here wasn't significant enough to merit a security patch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, on its own, this work doesn't seem to have identified something that's a major threat at the moment. But it's probably useful, in that it's a good thing to get the people who engineer the screening software to start thinking about emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's because, as the people behind this work note, AI protein design is still in its early stages, and we're likely to see considerable improvements. And there's likely to be a limit to the sorts of things we can screen for. We're already at the point where AI protein design tools can be used to create proteins that have entirely novel functions and do so without starting with variants of existing proteins. In other words, we can design proteins that are impossible to screen for based on similarity to known threats, because they don't look at all like anything we know is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein-based toxins would be very difficult to design, because they have to both cross the cell membrane and then do something dangerous once inside. While AI tools are probably unable to design something that sophisticated at the moment, I would be hesitant to rule out the prospects of them eventually reaching that sort of sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, a team of researchers led by Microsoft announced that they had discovered, and possibly patched, what they're terming a biological zero-day—an unrecognized security hole in a system that protects us from biological threats. The system at risk screens purchases of DNA sequences to determine when someone's ordering DNA that encodes a toxin or dangerous virus. But, the researchers argue, it has become increasingly vulnerable to missing a new threat: AI-designed toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How big of a threat is this? To understand, you have to know a bit more about both existing biosurveillance programs and the capabilities of AI-designed proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Catching the bad ones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological threats come in a variety of forms. Some are pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. Others are protein-based toxins, like the ricin that was sent to the White House in 2003. Still others are chemical toxins that are produced through enzymatic reactions, like the molecules associated with red tide. All of them get their start through the same fundamental biological process: DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then used to make proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several decades now, starting the process has been as easy as ordering the needed DNA sequence online from any of a number of companies, which will synthesize a requested sequence and ship it out. Recognizing the potential threat here, governments and industry have worked together to add a screening step to every order: the DNA sequence is scanned for its ability to encode parts of proteins or viruses considered threats. Any positives are then flagged for human intervention to evaluate whether they or the people ordering them truly represent a danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the list of proteins and the sophistication of the scanning have been continually updated in response to research progress over the years. For example, initial screening was done based on similarity to target DNA sequences. But there are many DNA sequences that can encode the same protein, so the screening algorithms have been adjusted accordingly, recognizing all the DNA variants that pose an identical threat.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The new work can be thought of as an extension of that threat. Not only can multiple DNA sequences encode the same protein; multiple proteins can perform the same function. To form a toxin, for example, typically requires the protein to adopt the correct three-dimensional structure, which brings a handful of critical amino acids within the protein into close proximity. Outside of those critical amino acids, however, things can often be quite flexible. Some amino acids may not matter at all; other locations in the protein could work with any positively charged amino acid, or any hydrophobic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, it could be extremely difficult (meaning time-consuming and expensive) to do the experiments that would tell you what sorts of changes a string of amino acids could tolerate while remaining functional. But the team behind the new analysis recognized that AI protein design tools have now gotten quite sophisticated and can predict when distantly related sequences can fold up into the same shape and catalyze the same reactions. The process is still error-prone, and you often have to test a dozen or more proposed proteins to get a working one, but it has produced some impressive successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the team developed a hypothesis to test: AI can take an existing toxin and design a protein with the same function that's distantly related enough that the screening programs do not detect orders for the DNA that encodes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The zero-day treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team started with a basic test: use AI tools to design variants of the toxin ricin, then test them against the software that is used to screen DNA orders. The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;"Taking inspiration from established cybersecurity processes for addressing such situations, we contacted the relevant bodies regarding the potential vulnerability, including the International Gene Synthesis Consortium and trusted colleagues in the protein design community as well as leads in biosecurity at the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, US National Institute of Standards and Technologies, US Department of Homeland Security, and US Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response," the authors report. "Outside of those bodies, details were kept confidential until a more comprehensive study could be performed in pursuit of potential mitigations and for 'patches'... to be developed and deployed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of that original test are being made available today as part of a much larger analysis that extends the approach to a large range of toxic proteins. Starting with 72 toxins, the researchers used three open source AI packages to generate a total of about 75,000 potential protein variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where things get a little complicated. Many of the AI-designed protein variants are going to end up being non-functional, either subtly or catastrophically failing to fold up into the correct configuration to create an active toxin. The only way to know which ones work is to make the proteins and test them biologically; most AI protein design efforts will make actual proteins from dozens to hundreds of the most promising-looking potential designs to find a handful that are active. But doing that for 75,000 designs is completely unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers used two software-based tools to evaluate each of the 75,000 designs. One of these focuses on the similarity between the overall predicted physical structure of the proteins, and another looks at the predicted differences between the positions of individual amino acids. Either way, they're a rough approximation of just how similar the proteins formed by two strings of amino acids should be. But they're definitely not a clear indicator of whether those two proteins would be equally functional.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, DNA sequences encoding all 75,000 designs were fed into the software that screens DNA orders for potential threats. One thing that was very clear is that there were huge variations in the ability of the four screening programs to flag these variant designs as threatening. Two of them seemed to do a pretty good job, one was mixed, and another let most of them through. Three of the software packages were updated in response to this performance, which significantly improved their ability to pick out variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a clear trend in all four screening packages: The closer the variant was to the original structurally, the more likely the package (both before and after the patches) was to be able to flag it as a threat. In all cases, there was also a cluster of variant designs that were unlikely to fold into a similar structure, and these generally weren't flagged as threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it's important to emphasize that this evaluation is based on predicted structures; "unlikely" to fold into a similar structure to the original toxin doesn't mean these proteins will be inactive as toxins. Functional proteins are probably going to be very rare among this group, but there may be a handful in there. That handful is also probably rare enough that you would have to order up and test far too many designs to find one that works, making this an impractical threat vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are also a handful of proteins that are very similar to the toxin structurally and not flagged by the software. For the three patched versions of the software, the ones that slip through the screening represent about 1 to 3 percent of the total in the "very similar" category. That's not great, but it's probably good enough that any group that tries to order up a toxin by this method would attract attention because they'd have to order over 50 just to have a good chance of finding one that slipped through, which would raise all sorts of red flags.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;One other notable result is that the designs that weren't flagged were mostly variants of just a handful of toxin proteins. So this is less of a general problem with the screening software and might be more of a small set of focused problems. Of note, one of the proteins that produced a lot of unflagged variants isn't toxic itself; instead, it's a co-factor necessary for the actual toxin to do its thing. As such, some of the screening software packages didn't even flag the original protein as dangerous, much less any of its variants. (For these reasons, the company that makes one of the better-performing software packages decided the threat here wasn't significant enough to merit a security patch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, on its own, this work doesn't seem to have identified something that's a major threat at the moment. But it's probably useful, in that it's a good thing to get the people who engineer the screening software to start thinking about emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's because, as the people behind this work note, AI protein design is still in its early stages, and we're likely to see considerable improvements. And there's likely to be a limit to the sorts of things we can screen for. We're already at the point where AI protein design tools can be used to create proteins that have entirely novel functions and do so without starting with variants of existing proteins. In other words, we can design proteins that are impossible to screen for based on similarity to known threats, because they don't look at all like anything we know is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein-based toxins would be very difficult to design, because they have to both cross the cell membrane and then do something dangerous once inside. While AI tools are probably unable to design something that sophisticated at the moment, I would be hesitant to rule out the prospects of them eventually reaching that sort of sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-b4723cd9-7fff-1a9e-4632-a731c7d5a6d7"&gt;For patients with inflammatory bowel disease, antibiotics can be a double-edged sword. The broad-spectrum drugs often prescribed for gut flare-ups can kill helpful microbes alongside harmful ones, sometimes worsening symptoms over time. When fighting gut inflammation, you don’t always want to bring a sledgehammer to a knife fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and McMaster University have identified a new compound that takes a more targeted approach. The molecule, called enterololin, suppresses a group of bacteria linked to Crohn’s disease flare-ups while leaving the rest of the microbiome largely intact. Using a generative AI model, the team mapped how the compound works, a process that usually takes years but was accelerated here to just months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This discovery speaks to a central challenge in antibiotic development,” says Jon Stokes, senior author of a new paper on the work, assistant professor of biochemistry and biomedical sciences at McMaster, and research affiliate at MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health. “The problem isn’t finding molecules that kill bacteria in a dish — we’ve been able to do that for a long time. A major hurdle is figuring out what those molecules actually do inside bacteria. Without that detailed understanding, you can’t develop these early-stage antibiotics into safe and effective therapies for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Enterololin is a stride toward precision antibiotics: treatments designed to knock out only the bacteria causing trouble. In mouse models of Crohn’s-like inflammation, the drug zeroed in on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;, a gut-dwelling bacterium that can worsen flares, while leaving most other microbial residents untouched. Mice given enterololin recovered faster and maintained a healthier microbiome than those treated with vancomycin, a common antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Pinning down a drug’s mechanism of action, the molecular target it binds inside bacterial cells, normally requires years of painstaking experiments. Stokes’ lab discovered enterololin using a high-throughput screening approach, but determining its target would have been the bottleneck. Here, the team turned to&amp;nbsp;DiffDock, a generative AI model developed at CSAIL by MIT PhD student Gabriele Corso and MIT Professor Regina Barzilay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;DiffDock was designed to predict how small molecules fit into the binding pockets of proteins, a notoriously difficult problem in structural biology. Traditional docking algorithms search through possible orientations using scoring rules, often producing noisy results. DiffDock instead frames docking as a probabilistic reasoning problem: a diffusion model iteratively refines guesses until it converges on the most likely binding mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“In just a couple of minutes, the model predicted that enterololin binds to a protein complex called LolCDE, which is essential for transporting lipoproteins in certain bacteria,” says Barzilay, who also co-leads the Jameel Clinic. “That was a very concrete lead — one that could guide experiments, rather than replace them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Stokes’ group then put that prediction to the test. Using DiffDock predictions as an experimental GPS, they first evolved enterololin-resistant mutants of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; in the lab, which revealed that changes in the mutant’s DNA mapped to lolCDE, precisely where DiffDock had predicted enterololin to bind. They also performed RNA sequencing to see which bacterial genes switched on or off when exposed to the drug, as well as used CRISPR to selectively knock down expression of the expected target. These laboratory experiments all revealed disruptions in pathways tied to lipoprotein transport, exactly what DiffDock had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“When you see the computational model and the wet-lab data pointing to the same mechanism, that’s when you start to believe you’ve figured something out,” says Stokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For Barzilay, the project highlights a shift in how AI is used in the life sciences. “A lot of AI use in drug discovery has been about searching chemical space, identifying new molecules that might be active,” she says. “What we’re showing here is that AI can also provide mechanistic explanations, which are critical for moving a molecule through the development pipeline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That distinction matters because mechanism-of-action studies are often a major rate-limiting step in drug development. Traditional approaches can take 18 months to two years, or more, and cost millions of dollars. In this case, the MIT–McMaster team cut the timeline to about six months, at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Enterololin is still in the early stages of development, but translation is already underway. Stokes’ spinout company, Stoked Bio, has licensed the compound and is optimizing its properties for potential human use. Early work is also exploring derivatives of the molecule against other resistant pathogens, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;. If all goes well, clinical trials could begin within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers also see broader implications. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics have long been sought as a way to treat infections without collateral damage to the microbiome, but they have been difficult to discover and validate. AI tools like DiffDock could make that process more practical, rapidly enabling a new generation of targeted antimicrobials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For patients with Crohn’s and other inflammatory bowel conditions, the prospect of a drug that reduces symptoms without destabilizing the microbiome could mean a meaningful improvement in quality of life. And in the bigger picture, precision antibiotics may help tackle the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“What excites me is not just this compound, but the idea that we can start thinking about the mechanism of action elucidation as something we can do more quickly, with the right combination of AI, human intuition, and laboratory experiments,” says Stokes. “That has the potential to change how we approach drug discovery for many diseases, not just Crohn’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“One of the greatest challenges to our health is the increase of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria that evade even our best antibiotics,” adds Yves Brun, professor at the University of Montreal and distinguished professor emeritus at Indiana University Bloomington, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “AI is becoming an important tool in our fight against these bacteria. This study uses a powerful and elegant combination of AI methods to determine the mechanism of action of a new antibiotic candidate, an important step in its potential development as a therapeutic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corso, Barzilay, and Stokes wrote the paper with McMaster researchers Denise B. Catacutan, Vian Tran, Jeremie Alexander, Yeganeh Yousefi, Megan Tu, Stewart McLellan, and Dominique Tertigas, and professors ​​Jakob Magolan, Michael Surette, Eric Brown, and Brian Coombes.

The molecule, called enterololin, suppresses a group of bacteria linked to Crohn’s disease flare-ups while leaving the rest of the microbiome largely intact. Using a generative AI model, the team mapped how the compound works, a process that usually takes years but was accelerated here to just months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This discovery speaks to a central challenge in antibiotic development,” says Jon Stokes, senior author of a new paper on the work, assistant professor of biochemistry and biomedical sciences at McMaster, and research affiliate at MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health. “The problem isn’t finding molecules that kill bacteria in a dish — we’ve been able to do that for a long time. A major hurdle is figuring out what those molecules actually do inside bacteria. Without that detailed understanding, you can’t develop these early-stage antibiotics into safe and effective therapies for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Enterololin is a stride toward precision antibiotics: treatments designed to knock out only the bacteria causing trouble. In mouse models of Crohn’s-like inflammation, the drug zeroed in on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;, a gut-dwelling bacterium that can worsen flares, while leaving most other microbial residents untouched. Mice given enterololin recovered faster and maintained a healthier microbiome than those treated with vancomycin, a common antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Pinning down a drug’s mechanism of action, the molecular target it binds inside bacterial cells, normally requires years of painstaking experiments. Stokes’ lab discovered enterololin using a high-throughput screening approach, but determining its target would have been the bottleneck. Here, the team turned to&amp;nbsp;DiffDock, a generative AI model developed at CSAIL by MIT PhD student Gabriele Corso and MIT Professor Regina Barzilay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;DiffDock was designed to predict how small molecules fit into the binding pockets of proteins, a notoriously difficult problem in structural biology. Traditional docking algorithms search through possible orientations using scoring rules, often producing noisy results. DiffDock instead frames docking as a probabilistic reasoning problem: a diffusion model iteratively refines guesses until it converges on the most likely binding mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“In just a couple of minutes, the model predicted that enterololin binds to a protein complex called LolCDE, which is essential for transporting lipoproteins in certain bacteria,” says Barzilay, who also co-leads the Jameel Clinic. “That was a very concrete lead — one that could guide experiments, rather than replace them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Stokes’ group then put that prediction to the test. Using DiffDock predictions as an experimental GPS, they first evolved enterololin-resistant mutants of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; in the lab, which revealed that changes in the mutant’s DNA mapped to lolCDE, precisely where DiffDock had predicted enterololin to bind. They also performed RNA sequencing to see which bacterial genes switched on or off when exposed to the drug, as well as used CRISPR to selectively knock down expression of the expected target. These laboratory experiments all revealed disruptions in pathways tied to lipoprotein transport, exactly what DiffDock had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“When you see the computational model and the wet-lab data pointing to the same mechanism, that’s when you start to believe you’ve figured something out,” says Stokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For Barzilay, the project highlights a shift in how AI is used in the life sciences. “A lot of AI use in drug discovery has been about searching chemical space, identifying new molecules that might be active,” she says. “What we’re showing here is that AI can also provide mechanistic explanations, which are critical for moving a molecule through the development pipeline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That distinction matters because mechanism-of-action studies are often a major rate-limiting step in drug development. Traditional approaches can take 18 months to two years, or more, and cost millions of dollars. In this case, the MIT–McMaster team cut the timeline to about six months, at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Enterololin is still in the early stages of development, but translation is already underway. Stokes’ spinout company, Stoked Bio, has licensed the compound and is optimizing its properties for potential human use. Early work is also exploring derivatives of the molecule against other resistant pathogens, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;. If all goes well, clinical trials could begin within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers also see broader implications. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics have long been sought as a way to treat infections without collateral damage to the microbiome, but they have been difficult to discover and validate. AI tools like DiffDock could make that process more practical, rapidly enabling a new generation of targeted antimicrobials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For patients with Crohn’s and other inflammatory bowel conditions, the prospect of a drug that reduces symptoms without destabilizing the microbiome could mean a meaningful improvement in quality of life. And in the bigger picture, precision antibiotics may help tackle the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“What excites me is not just this compound, but the idea that we can start thinking about the mechanism of action elucidation as something we can do more quickly, with the right combination of AI, human intuition, and laboratory experiments,” says Stokes. “That has the potential to change how we approach drug discovery for many diseases, not just Crohn’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“One of the greatest challenges to our health is the increase of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria that evade even our best antibiotics,” adds Yves Brun, professor at the University of Montreal and distinguished professor emeritus at Indiana University Bloomington, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “AI is becoming an important tool in our fight against these bacteria. This study uses a powerful and elegant combination of AI methods to determine the mechanism of action of a new antibiotic candidate, an important step in its potential development as a therapeutic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corso, Barzilay, and Stokes wrote the paper with McMaster researchers Denise B. Catacutan, Vian Tran, Jeremie Alexander, Yeganeh Yousefi, Megan Tu, Stewart McLellan, and Dominique Tertigas, and professors ​​Jakob Magolan, Michael Surette, Eric Brown, and Brian Coombes. Their research was supported, in part, by the Weston Family Foundation; the David Braley Centre for Antibiotic Discovery; the Canadian Institutes of Health Research; the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; M. and M. Heersink; Canadian Institutes for Health Research; Ontario Graduate Scholarship Award; the Jameel Clinic; and the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency Discovery of Medical Countermeasures Against New and Emerging Threats program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers posted sequencing data in public repositories and released the DiffDock-L code openly on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Andreessen Horowitz has agreed to lead the investment, and Lightspeed and Lux Capital are also participating in the deal, two of the sources said, although none of those VC firms responded to our request for comment.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rao has already raised hundreds of millions and plans to begin building the startup without waiting for the full $1 billion round to close, our sources said. He plans to raise the rest of the capital in installments, a funding approach commonly referred to as a “tranched” round.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rao declined to comment, although he did publicly acknowledge the new startup on X last week, confirming its name and describing its hoped-for product as “rethinking the foundations of a computer to build a new substrate for intelligence that is as efficient as biology.

Prior to MosaicML, Rao co-founded the machine learning platform Nervana Systems, which Intel Corp. acquired in 2016 for reportedly more than $400 million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rao, who spent over two years as VP of AI at Databricks (now valued at $100 billion and generating $4 billion in ARR), left the company last month to focus on his new startup, according to his LinkedIn profile and earlier reporting by Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chief executive and co-founder Sujith Vishwajith&amp;nbsp;announced&amp;nbsp;the acquisition on Friday, and a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch he is the only one of Roi’s four-person staff to join OpenAI. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.&amp;nbsp;The company will&amp;nbsp;wind down operations and end its service to customers on October 15.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Roi deal marks the latest in a string of&amp;nbsp;acqui-hires from OpenAI this year, including Context.ai, Crossing Minds, and Alex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;not clear whether any of Roi’s technology will transfer over to OpenAI or which unit&amp;nbsp;Vishwajith&amp;nbsp;will join, the acquisition clearly aligns with OpenAI’s bet on personalization and life management as the next layer of AI products. Roi brings a specialized team that has already tried to solve personalization in finance at scale — a challenge whose lessons can be applied more broadly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;New York-based&amp;nbsp;Roi&amp;nbsp;was founded in&amp;nbsp;2022&amp;nbsp;and has raised $3.6 million in&amp;nbsp;early-stage&amp;nbsp;funding&amp;nbsp;from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Spark Capital, Gradient Ventures, and&amp;nbsp;Spacecadet&amp;nbsp;Ventures, according to&amp;nbsp;PitchBook&amp;nbsp;data. Its mission was to aggregate a user’s financial footprint, including stocks, crypto, DeFi, real-estate, and NFTs, into one app that can track funds, provide insights, and help people make trades.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We started Roi 3 years ago to make investing accessible to everyone by building the most personalized financial experience,” Vishwajith wrote in a post on X. “Along the way we realized personalization&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;just the future of finance.&amp;nbsp;It’s&amp;nbsp;the future of software.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond tracking trades,&amp;nbsp;Roi gave users&amp;nbsp;access to a financially savvy AI companion&amp;nbsp;that responded in ways that made sense for them.&amp;nbsp;When signing up, users could personalize Roi by providing information like what they do for a living and how they wanted Roi to respond to them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In one telling example&amp;nbsp;that Roi posted on X, the sample user wrote: “Talk to me like&amp;nbsp;I’m&amp;nbsp;a Gen-Z kid with brain rot. Use as little words as possible and roast me as much as you&amp;nbsp;want&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;don’t&amp;nbsp;mind.”&amp;nbsp;In response to a query about the status of the user’s portfolio, Roi replied: “Suje, you got cooked&amp;nbsp;lil&amp;nbsp;bro. Cause of the tariff announcements, you took an L today of $32,459.12…Based on your risk preference this might be an opportunity to buy the dip.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The exchange highlights the philosophy behind Roi and its co-founder — that software shouldn’t just provide generic answers but should adapt, learn, and communicate in ways that feel personal, human, and most importantly, keep&amp;nbsp;you engaged.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As the Roi team wrote in a blog post: “The products we use every day won’t remain static, predetermined experiences. They’ll become adaptive, deeply personal companions that understand us, learn from us, and evolve with us.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That vision dovetails with OpenAI’s existing consumer efforts, including&amp;nbsp;Pulse, which generates personalized news and content reports for users as they sleep;&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Sora&amp;nbsp;app,&amp;nbsp;a TikTok competitor filled with AI-generated content, including personal cameos from users; and&amp;nbsp;Instant Checkout, a feature that lets users shop and make purchases directly in ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;deal&amp;nbsp;also comes as OpenAI beefs up its consumer applications team,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;led by former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo.&amp;nbsp;It’s&amp;nbsp;a further signal that OpenAI&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;just trying to be an API&amp;nbsp;provider, but&amp;nbsp;wants to&amp;nbsp;build&amp;nbsp;its own end-user apps. Roi’s talent and tech could slot right into these apps and help make them more adaptive.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vishwajith, alongside his co-founder Chip Davis, used to work at Airbnb, where he developed a knack for optimizing&amp;nbsp;user behavior&amp;nbsp;to drive revenue.&amp;nbsp;By his&amp;nbsp;account, a&amp;nbsp;simple change of 25 lines of code led to $10+ million in&amp;nbsp;additional&amp;nbsp;cash.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Being able to bring in meaningful revenue via consumer apps is more important than ever to OpenAI as it continues to burn through&amp;nbsp;billions on data centers and&amp;nbsp;infrastructure&amp;nbsp;to power its models.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-6.27.11PM.png?resize=1200,743" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;acquired&amp;nbsp;Roi, an AI-powered personal finance app. In keeping with a recent trend in the AI industry, only&amp;nbsp;the CEO is making the jump.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
