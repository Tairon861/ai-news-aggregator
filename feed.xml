The latest round, which comes just four months after the company raised its $22 million Series A, was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, these sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s AI voice agents are designed to take over high-volume, repetitive tasks like scheduling, cancellations, and frequently asked questions normally managed by front desk staff, allowing human staff to focus on more complex or sensitive patient interactions.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Assort Health is one of several startups that recently raised new funding to use AI to alleviate patient phone call volume for medical offices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just last week, EliseAI, which automates customer services for real estate and healthcare office front desks, announced that it secured a $250 million Series E led by Andreessen Horowitz, valuing the company at $2.2 billion. Hello Patient, another AI-powered assistant for medical offices, raised a $20 million Series A earlier this month at a $100 million valuation led by Scale Venture Partners, according to a person familiar with the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The healthcare industry is increasingly embracing AI solutions, as seen in the growing adoption of medical scribes from companies like Abridge and Ambience Healthcare. Investors are now betting that patient communication will be the next major area for AI implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since Assort Health serves small and medium specialty care offices that often have long wait times, fast responses by an AI agent may help these offices lose fewer patients to competing practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Assort Health’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is only a little more than $3 million, the company is growing quickly, according to two sources. The startup initially focused on orthopedic and physical care offices but has recently expanded its offerings to other specialties, including OB-GYN, dermatology, and dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;

Rubin is capable of capturing many more stars than any other astronomical observatory ever built; it also sees many more satellites. Up to 40% of images captured by the observatory within its first 10 years of operation will be marred by their sunlight-reflecting streaks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meredith Rawls, a research scientist at the telescope’s flagship observation project, Vera Rubin’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time, is one of the experts tasked with protecting Rubin’s science mission from the satellite blight, which could make observations more difficult because the satellites are millions of times brighter than the faint stars and galaxies it hopes to study. Satellites could also confuse astronomers when the sudden brightening they cause gets mistaken for astronomical phenomena.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An unexpected path&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Rawls joined the Rubin project in 2016, she says, she had no clue what turn her career would take. “I was hired as a postdoc to help build a new imaging pipeline to process precursor images [and] analyze results to identify things we needed to fix or change,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2019, SpaceX began deploying its internet-beaming Starlink constellation, and the astronomical community started to sound alarm bells. The satellites were orbiting too low and reflected too much sunlight, leaving bright marks in telescope images. A year later, Rawls and a handful of her colleagues were the first to make a scientific assessment of the satellite streaks’ effect on astronomical observations, using images from the Víctor M. Blanco telescope (which, like Rubin, is in Chile). “We wanted to see how bright those streaks were and look at possible mitigation strategies,” Rawls says. Her team found that although the streaks weren’t overwhelmingly bright, they still risked affecting scientific observations.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Streak removal&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since those early observations, an entirely new subdiscipline of astronomical image processing has emerged, focusing on techniques to remove satellite light pollution from the data and designing observation protocols to prevent too-bright satellites from spoiling the views. Rawls has become one of the leading experts in the fast-evolving field, which is only set to grow in importance in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We are fundamentally altering the night sky by launching a lot more stuff at an unsustainably increasing rate,” says Rawls, who is also an astronomy researcher at the University of Washington.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To mitigate the damage, she and her colleagues designed algorithms that compare images of the same spot in the sky to detect unexpected changes and determine whether those could have been caused by passing satellites or natural phenomena like asteroids or stellar explosions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A rising force&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The number of satellites orbiting our planet has risen from a mere thousand some 15 years ago to more than 12,000 active satellites today. About 8,000 of those belong to SpaceX’s Starlink, but other ventures threaten to worsen the light-pollution problem in the coming years. US-based AST SpaceMobile, for example, is building a constellation of giant orbiting antenna arrays to beam 5G connectivity directly to users’ phones. The first five of these satellites—each over 60 square meters in size—are already in orbit and reflecting so much light that Rubin must adjust its observing schedule to avoid their paths.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“So far, what we’ve seen with the initial images is that it’s a nuisance but not a science-ending thing,” says Rawls. She remains optimistic that she and her colleagues can stay on top of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tereza Pultarova is a London-based science and technology journalist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SatelliteErasure-thumb.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the $800 million Vera Rubin Observatory commenced its decade-long quest to create an extremely detailed time-lapse movie of the universe.

The subject, naturally, turned to AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mat Honan" class="wp-image-1119107" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/mat_debrief.png?w=1012" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“No one my age &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; AI. No one is excited about it,” she told me of her high-school-age peers. Why not? I asked. “Because,” she replied, “it seems like all the jobs we thought we wanted to do are going to go away.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was struck by her pessimism, which she told me was shared by friends from California to Georgia to New Hampshire. In an already fragile world, one increasingly beset by climate change and the breakdown of the international order, AI looms in the background, threatening young people’s ability to secure a prosperous future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s an understandable concern. Just a few days before our drive, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was telling the US Federal Reserve’s board of governors that AI agents will leave entire job categories “just like totally, totally gone.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; he believes AI will wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company will eliminate jobs in favor of AI agents in the coming years. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke told staff they had to prove that new roles couldn’t be done by AI before making a hire. And the view is not limited to tech. Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, recently said he expects AI to replace half of all white-collar jobs in the US.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;These are no longer mere theoretical projections. There is already evidence that AI is affecting employment. Hiring of new grads is down, for example, in sectors like tech and finance. While that is not entirely due to AI, the technology is almost certainly playing a role.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Gen Z, the issue is broader than employment. It also touches on another massive generational challenge: climate change. AI is computationally intensive and requires massive data centers. Huge complexes have already been built all across the country, from Virginia in the east to Nevada in the west. That buildout is only going to accelerate as companies race to be first to create superintelligence. Meta and OpenAI have announced plans for data centers that will require five gigawatts of power just for their ­computing—enough to power the entire state of Maine in the summertime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s very likely that utilities will turn to natural gas to power these facilities; some already have. That means more carbon dioxide emissions for an already warming world. Data centers also require vast amounts of water. There are communities right now that are literally running out of water because it’s being taken by nearby data centers, even as climate change makes that resource more scarce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Proponents argue that AI will make the grid more efficient, that it will help us achieve technological breakthroughs leading to cleaner energy sources and, I don’t know, more butterflies and bumblebees? But xAI is belching CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the Memphis skies from its methane-fueled generators&lt;em&gt; right now&lt;/em&gt;. Google’s electricity demand and emissions are skyrocketing &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Things would be different, my daughter told me, if it were obviously useful. But for much of her generation, she argued, it’s a looming threat with ample costs and no obvious utility: “It’s not good for research because it’s not highly accurate. You can’t use it for writing because it’s banned—and people get zeros on papers who haven’t even used it because of AI detectors. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; it seems like it’s going to take all the good jobs. One teacher told us we’re all going to be janitors.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It would be naïve to think we are going back to a world without AI. We’re not.

Yet the industry faces some daunting challenges if the vision is to be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of decentralisation imagine a world where AI is not controlled by a select few big tech corporations, but rather by a global community that invites everyone to participate and have their say. It’s an audacious goal, but as it slowly comes into view, a question arises – are we really on the cusp of democratising access to intelligent automation, or are we creating a recipe for disaster?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-dream-of-decentralised-artificial-intelligence"&gt;The dream of decentralised artificial intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best known AI models in the world are controlled by a few select companies – OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, DeepSeek et al. – creating a familiar feeling that the AI industry, much like today’s internet, will be dominated by a handful of all-powerful monarchs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has fueled the desire for a more equitable and open AI landscape, and it has attracted some vocal supporters. The founder of Stabiliy AI Emad Mostaque made headlines when he sensationally quit his role in March 2024, saying he wanted to “pursue decentralised AI” in order to ensure that the technology remains open and accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostaque’s vision resonates with legislators. In France, the Competition Authority Chief Benoît Cœuré pointed out that AI is the first technology that has been “dominated by major players from the outset”, and pointed to decentralised AI as the only chance to change this state of affairs before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who champion decentralised AI argue it will lead to a world where individual developers, students, startups and hobbyists will be able to pool their knowledge, computing resources and data to enable anyone to participate, resulting in what MIT says will be “democratised innovation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also point to transparency as another major benefit, with open AI models running on blockchain, ensuring that any biased or toxic algorithms will quickly be identified and rejected. Greyscale Research, in a study, found that open networks do indeed have the ability to eliminate bias in AI, in stark contrast to the opaque, centralised models used today, which are often referred to as “black boxes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other benefits of decentralised AI include resistance to censorship and accessibility. The likes of Google and OpenAI typically bake in content filters, blocking their models from discussing or answering questions on certain topics, and charge for access. While decentralised models may also have content filters, their open nature means that these can easily be bypassed. Moreover, no one can charge for access to a decentralised, community-owned model, which means use isn’t restricted to only those with the financial means to pay for access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general consensus among the decentralised AI community is that the world will be much better off if this technology is collectively owned and open to contributions from every corner of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-reality-might-be-different"&gt;The reality might be different&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of these positives, the decentralised AI industry must run through a gauntlet of formidable challenges to live up to this vision. By bringing AI out of its carefully controlled, centralised data centres and letting it loose on a global network owned by everyone, it opens it up to numerous risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most difficult questions pertains to data integrity and synchronisation. Mechanisms like federated learning can solve the latter challenge, but it doesn’t provide much of a solution to the risk of data poisoning, which could skew the outputs of decentralised models. We can, perhaps, add a blockchain layer to increase transparency, but this may increase complexity, complicating data processing tasks and slowing down innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are well-founded concerns that, while distributed networks mean lower costs and potentially reduced bias, these benefits come at the sacrifice of efficiency, which can hamstring the capabilities of decentralised AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for immense computational resources is a barrier, too. While Chinese firms like DeepSeek have apparently achieved success with more limited resources, generally the most sophisticated AI models require access to vast numbers of powerful GPUs. Acquiring these resources, and coordinating them, remains a major challenge for decentralised networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are some promising solutions to this. For instance, 0G Labs recently announced a promising breakthrough in the shape of its DiLoCoX framework, which breaks down model training tasks to their individual parts, spreading them in multiple nodes so they can be done in parallel, before synchronising the results with the network once these training jobs are completed. In doing this, 0G claims to be able to train vastly more powerful decentralised models on only limited resources, regardless of the available network bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By enabling the training of massive AI models on slower and cheaper networks, and with more accessible hardware than a high-speed data centre, even smaller businesses and individuals will be able to train their own advanced models with speed and accuracy,” says 0G Labs CEO, Michael Heinrich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the solutions for issues around decentralised AI’s security are less apparent. It’s something of a paradox, because while decentralised control significantly reduces the risk of a single point of failure, it also increases the attack surface to a potentially infinite number of endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there are still questions around the governance of decentralised AI models. For instance, who makes the decisions on what parts of the model should be improved, what guardrails should be built in, and so on? And who is accountable should any problems arise with a decentralised model?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of accountability could lead to a kind of “ethical vacuum”, resulting in massive abuse of decentralised AI models that are every bit as powerful as their centralised cousins, with extremely negative consequences. As a solution, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin has proposed a kind of hybrid model, with “AI serving as the engine and humans sitting behind the wheel.” The approach, Vitalik believes, would combine AI’s power with human judgment to create a more balanced and decentralised system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decentralised-a"&gt;Decentralised A&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralised AI’s future remains uncertain, and while its development is motivated by grand intentions, the path ahead will be tricky to navigate. For advocates, it’s the only way we’re ever going to democratise AI technology and unlock its true potential. Critics, on the other hand, point to the ethical challenges and the alarming potential for abuse, due to the lack of accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it’s clear that the decentralised AI community is pushing forward anyway, in spite of these risks. For believers, the dream of a truly open, transparent, community-led AI industry that’s accessible to all is just too powerful to ignore, and so there’s nothing to stop them. We’ll just have to hope that as they pursue this dream, they don’t lose sight of the risks and take time to build the guardrails that can prevent things from getting out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/igor-omilaev-9XtKSci9crg-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralised artificial intelligence has been hailed as one of the most profound innovations of our time, promising to give users control of the most transformative technologies. Yet the industry faces some daunting challenges if the vision is to be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of decentralisation imagine a world where AI is not controlled by a select few big tech corporations, but rather by a global community that invites everyone to participate and have their say. It’s an audacious goal, but as it slowly comes into view, a question arises – are we really on the cusp of democratising access to intelligent automation, or are we creating a recipe for disaster?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-dream-of-decentralised-artificial-intelligence"&gt;The dream of decentralised artificial intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best known AI models in the world are controlled by a few select companies – OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, DeepSeek et al. – creating a familiar feeling that the AI industry, much like today’s internet, will be dominated by a handful of all-powerful monarchs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has fueled the desire for a more equitable and open AI landscape, and it has attracted some vocal supporters. The founder of Stabiliy AI Emad Mostaque made headlines when he sensationally quit his role in March 2024, saying he wanted to “pursue decentralised AI” in order to ensure that the technology remains open and accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostaque’s vision resonates with legislators. In France, the Competition Authority Chief Benoît Cœuré pointed out that AI is the first technology that has been “dominated by major players from the outset”, and pointed to decentralised AI as the only chance to change this state of affairs before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who champion decentralised AI argue it will lead to a world where individual developers, students, startups and hobbyists will be able to pool their knowledge, computing resources and data to enable anyone to participate, resulting in what MIT says will be “democratised innovation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also point to transparency as another major benefit, with open AI models running on blockchain, ensuring that any biased or toxic algorithms will quickly be identified and rejected. Greyscale Research, in a study, found that open networks do indeed have the ability to eliminate bias in AI, in stark contrast to the opaque, centralised models used today, which are often referred to as “black boxes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other benefits of decentralised AI include resistance to censorship and accessibility. The likes of Google and OpenAI typically bake in content filters, blocking their models from discussing or answering questions on certain topics, and charge for access. While decentralised models may also have content filters, their open nature means that these can easily be bypassed. Moreover, no one can charge for access to a decentralised, community-owned model, which means use isn’t restricted to only those with the financial means to pay for access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general consensus among the decentralised AI community is that the world will be much better off if this technology is collectively owned and open to contributions from every corner of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-reality-might-be-different"&gt;The reality might be different&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of these positives, the decentralised AI industry must run through a gauntlet of formidable challenges to live up to this vision.

However, this 100 percent investment return comes at a large human cost—placing an estimated 27,000 finance industry jobs at risk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that AI technologies are moving beyond experimental pilots and becoming deeply embedded in the core processes of banking, from customer service to the unseen functions of the back office.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Donlon, Chief Technology Officer at Zopa, said: “GenAI marks a paradigm shift in applied computing. Its influence on productivity, software creation, and decisionmaking systems could rival the advent of the internet or cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At Zopa, we’ve been operationalising machine learning for over a decade, well before LLMs became mainstream. That depth of experience has shaped our belief that GenAI isn’t a feature add-on, but a foundational capability. For Zopa technologists, it’s a rare chance to build entirely new intelligence layers, at a level that will redefine the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-silent-ai-revolution-in-the-back-offices-of-banks"&gt;The silent AI revolution in the back offices of banks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While customer-facing chatbots and personalised app experiences often capture the headlines, the report reveals that the most dramatic impact of AI is occurring behind the scenes. 82 percent of all time saved through this technology, amounting to 154 million hours by 2030, will come from back office operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These functions – which include regulatory compliance, fraud detection, and risk management – are traditionally labour-intensive and highly complex. AI is expected to automate vast swathes of this important finance work, helping with everything from Know Your Customer (KYC) checks to anti-money laundering (AML) monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial implications of AI for these back office functions are immense, with projected cost savings in this area alone reaching £923 million annually by the end of the decade; representing more than half of the total savings across the entire sector.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This automation is not merely about cutting costs. With regulations such as the Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud reimbursement rules increasing banks’ liability, the ability of AI to detect novel fraud patterns in real-time and reduce human error is becoming a competitive and financial necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we often hear about AI across industries, by automating routine checks and analysis, the technology frees up human experts. For the finance industry, these experts can focus their skills on the most complex investigations to improve both efficiency and effectiveness in the fight against financial crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hyper-personalising-the-banking-experience-with-ai"&gt;Hyper-personalising the banking experience with AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drive for hyper-personalisation in the finance industry is fuelling a massive investment in customer service AI. The report projects that UK banks will pour over £1.1 billion into customer-facing AI by 2030, the largest share of investment across all segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This capital inflow for personalisation is being used to develop sophisticated virtual assistants and chatbots capable of handling complex queries; offering personalised financial advice and even anticipating customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to move far beyond the rules-based bots of the past towards a truly conversational and intelligent interface. This shift is expected to yield large efficiencies, saving £540 million in operational costs and freeing up 26 million hours of human agents’ time annually by 2030. These employees can also be redeployed to handle more complex and high-value interactions that require a human touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portfolio management is also set to benefit. Investment in this area is projected to grow to £145 million by 2030. Here, AI is being positioned not as a replacement for human advisors but as a powerful augmentation tool. It can synthesise vast market data, simulate portfolio performance, and automate routine reporting, allowing human experts to focus on decisionmaking and client relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-impact-of-ai-on-finance-jobs"&gt;The impact of AI on finance jobs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficiency gains delivered by AI inevitably raise urgent questions about the future of the financial workforce. The report’s projection that 27,000 roles could be displaced by 2030 is a concerning figure. Customer service and back-office positions are expected to bear the brunt of this change, with nearly 14,000 and 10,000 jobs at risk respectively.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the authors of the report suggest this is not simply a story of job losses but one of fundamental role redefinition. The displacement of finance jobs centred on repetitive, manual tasks creates an opportunity to upskill the banking workforce for new positions focused on AI governance, data strategy, and overseeing these complex automated systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donlon emphasises this point, viewing the technological shift as a catalyst for positive change. He notes that “this investment ushers in a once-in-a-generation opportunity to re-skill and reimagine the workforce that powers our financial system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge for the industry, Donlon suggests, is to proactively manage this transition. “Above all, our aim is to equip banks, fintechs, regulators, and policymakers with the insight needed to seize this historic moment-to shape the jobs of the future, not simply react to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report concludes with a clear warning for established institutions. A notable capability gap is already emerging between technologically advanced challenger banks, which have built their platforms around AI, and legacy banks encumbered by older systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Maynard, VP of Fintech Market Research at Juniper Research, commented: “The UK banking sector stands at a tipping point, with GenAI being set to reshape how banking fundamentally works. GenAI creates risk and opportunity—the risk of a major shift in the skills workers will need to thrive, but the opportunity to create a better banking experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Digital-only brands like Zopa already have deep experience with AI in their operations and will be less impacted by this shift. As such, digital banks and their experiences will be critical to leading the banking market through this revolution.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the high street banking giants, the message is unequivocal: adapt to the AI revolution or risk losing relevance in a finance industry being redefined by efficiency, personalisation, and intelligent automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen AI makes no financial difference in 95% of cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for the AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo event series." class="wp-image-109137" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
