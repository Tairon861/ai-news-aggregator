&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI company has been operating as many as 35 generators without permits, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) said. Altogether, they’re capable of producing up to 421 megawatts of electricity. The legal organization has said that it will sue xAI for violations of the Clean Air Act on behalf of the NAACP.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company recently raised $10 billion, split evenly between debt and equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The permit issued by the Shelby County Health Department says that xAI can operate 15 Solar SMT-130 generators with certain emissions controls, which can generate up to 247 megawatts. The company has already been operating eight of the same model without permits, according to the SELC, though the group added that the ones in operation do have the appropriate pollution controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under the conditions of the permit, xAI will still be allowed to emit significant amounts of pollution on a rolling 12-month basis, including 87 tons of smog-forming NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, 94 tons of carbon monoxide, 85 tons of volatile organic compounds, 73 tons of particulate pollution, and nearly 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants, including 9.8 tons of formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. The company is required to keep its own emissions records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before the permit was issued, a Memphis community group said that it had $250,000 in funds to pay for an independent air quality study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The City of Memphis performed its own air quality testing in June, though the SELC raised several concerns about the way the tests were carried out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The testing contractor did not measure ozone levels, the SELC noted, and the tests were done on days when the wind was blowing xAI’s pollution away from the two closest testing sites. The contractor also placed the testing equipment either directly against or in close proximity to buildings, which can interfere with results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Previously, the health department claimed that it did not have the authority to permit “mobile” gas-burning turbines if they were in operation for less than 364 days, saying that under those circumstances, the EPA was the relevant regulator. The SELC said that the interpretation of the law was “incorrect” and the letter justifying inaction was “without any legal analysis.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2217198328.jpeg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;County regulators yesterday granted xAI permits to operate 15 natural gas turbines at its data center outside Memphis, despite the threat of a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of backlash over alleged pollution concerns, xAI has finally secured an air permit covering some of the methane gas turbines powering its Colossus supercomputer data center in Memphis, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Shelby County Health Department granted xAI an air permit that allows it to power 15 gas turbines while adhering to a range of restrictions designed to minimize emissions. Expiring on January 2, 2027, the permit requires xAI to install and operate the best available control technology (BACT) by September 1 to ensure emissions do not exceed certain limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any failure to comply could trigger enforcement actions by the Environmental Protection Agency or the county health department, the permit notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Memphis residents insist that the health department should already be investigating xAI for possible enforcement actions. They claim that the AI company owned by Elon Musk has been operating dozens of turbines without BACT for more than a year, exposing predominantly Black neighborhoods located near the facility—who have historically suffered from industrial poor air quality—to a potential new major source of pollution. In June, the NAACP threatened legal action within 60 days&amp;nbsp;if xAI refused to meet with groups concerned about the alleged smog-forming pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the health department is finally requiring xAI to install BACT is not a comfort to residents, the Southern Environmental Law Center said in a press release sent to Ars. Most glaringly, the air permit does not seem to cover all the gas turbines potentially operating at the facility, the SELC noted. Thermal imaging taken July 1 shows that xAI maintains 24 gas turbines on site, the SELC said, which is substantially more than the 15 that xAI will soon be required to dutifully report on—tracking every startup, shutdown, and combustion so that the health department can finally start tracking emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the SELC, the health department's decision granting permits covering some of xAI's turbines—but not all of them—"ignores the facility’s continued use of turbines not covered by the permit and months of intense public pushback from local communities in Memphis who worry about the impact xAI’s operations will have on their air."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;For Memphis residents, xAI's facility operating even a single turbine without BACT potentially threatens to release pollutants "tied to asthma, respiratory illnesses, heart problems, and even certain types of cancer." These communities already live in a place that does not meet national standards for smog, the SELC said, and they "face elevated asthma rates and cancer risks four times the national average."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the press release, critics decried the health department's decision to grant xAI the permits. LaTricea Adams, the CEO and president of Young, Gifted &amp;amp; Green, described the decision as "a stark reminder that our community's health continues to be compromised for profit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SELC Senior Attorney Amanda Garcia accused the health department of "turning a blind eye to obvious Clean Air Act violations in order to allow another polluter to set up shop in this already-overburdened community without appropriate protections." She confirmed that the SELC is evaluating its options to move forward with its efforts to confront xAI and demand more transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To community members, the health department's decision to grant the permits without probing xAI's alleged unlawful operations over the past year was "devastating," KeShaun Pearson, director of Memphis Community Against Pollution, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are deeply disappointed and oppose the decision by our Shelby County Health Department to approve the permit without meaningfully addressing the unlawful use of turbines on the site," Pearson said. "Our local leaders are entrusted with protecting us from corporations violating on our right to clean air, but we are witnessing their failure to do so. We are devastated, yet we remain determined to the mission of justice for our families in South Memphis who are overburdened with air pollution."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI and the Shelby County Health Department did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Critics demand more transparency from xAI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While critics continue to fight for more transparency, they also acknowledge that the overdue air permit at least suggests that some of xAI's feared pollution could be checked in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Before xAI got the permit, residents were stuck relying on infrequent thermal imaging to determine how many turbines appeared to be running without BACT. Now that xAI has secured the permit, the company will be required to "record the date, time, and durations of all startups, shutdowns, malfunctions, and tuning events" and "always minimize emissions including startup, shutdown, maintenance, and combustion tuning periods."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These records—which also document fuel usage, facility-wide emissions, and excess emissions—must be shared with the health department semiannually, with xAI's first report due by December 31. Additionally, xAI must maintain five years of "monitoring, preventive, and maintenance records for air pollution control equipment," which the department can request to review at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Memphis residents worried about smog-forming pollution, the worst fear would likely be visibly detecting the pollution. Mitigating this, xAI's air permit requires that visible emissions "from each emission point at the facility shall not exceed" 20 percent in opacity for more than minutes in any one-hour period or more than 20 minutes in any 24-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also prevents xAI from operating turbines all the time, limiting xAI to "a maximum of 22 startup events and 22 shutdown events per year" for the 15 turbines included in the permit, "with a total combined duration of 110 hours annually." Additionally, it specifies that each startup or shutdown event must not exceed one hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior communications manager for the SELC, Eric Hilt, told Ars that the "SELC and our partners intend to continue monitoring xAI's operations in the Memphis area." He further noted that the air permit does not address all of citizens' concerns at a time when xAI is planning to build another data center in the area, sparking new questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While these permits increase the amount of public information and accountability around 15 of xAI's turbines, there are still significant concerns around transparency—both for xAI's first South Memphis data center near the Boxtown neighborhood and the planned data center in the Whitehaven neighborhood," Hilt said. "XAI has not said how that second data center will be powered or if it plans to use gas turbines for that facility as well."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of backlash over alleged pollution concerns, xAI has finally secured an air permit covering some of the methane gas turbines powering its Colossus supercomputer data center in Memphis, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Shelby County Health Department granted xAI an air permit that allows it to power 15 gas turbines while adhering to a range of restrictions designed to minimize emissions. Expiring on January 2, 2027, the permit requires xAI to install and operate the best available control technology (BACT) by September 1 to ensure emissions do not exceed certain limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any failure to comply could trigger enforcement actions by the Environmental Protection Agency or the county health department, the permit notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Memphis residents insist that the health department should already be investigating xAI for possible enforcement actions. They claim that the AI company owned by Elon Musk has been operating dozens of turbines without BACT for more than a year, exposing predominantly Black neighborhoods located near the facility—who have historically suffered from industrial poor air quality—to a potential new major source of pollution. In June, the NAACP threatened legal action within 60 days&amp;nbsp;if xAI refused to meet with groups concerned about the alleged smog-forming pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the health department is finally requiring xAI to install BACT is not a comfort to residents, the Southern Environmental Law Center said in a press release sent to Ars. Most glaringly, the air permit does not seem to cover all the gas turbines potentially operating at the facility, the SELC noted. Thermal imaging taken July 1 shows that xAI maintains 24 gas turbines on site, the SELC said, which is substantially more than the 15 that xAI will soon be required to dutifully report on—tracking every startup, shutdown, and combustion so that the health department can finally start tracking emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the SELC, the health department's decision granting permits covering some of xAI's turbines—but not all of them—"ignores the facility’s continued use of turbines not covered by the permit and months of intense public pushback from local communities in Memphis who worry about the impact xAI’s operations will have on their air."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;For Memphis residents, xAI's facility operating even a single turbine without BACT potentially threatens to release pollutants "tied to asthma, respiratory illnesses, heart problems, and even certain types of cancer." These communities already live in a place that does not meet national standards for smog, the SELC said, and they "face elevated asthma rates and cancer risks four times the national average."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the press release, critics decried the health department's decision to grant xAI the permits. LaTricea Adams, the CEO and president of Young, Gifted &amp;amp; Green, described the decision as "a stark reminder that our community's health continues to be compromised for profit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SELC Senior Attorney Amanda Garcia accused the health department of "turning a blind eye to obvious Clean Air Act violations in order to allow another polluter to set up shop in this already-overburdened community without appropriate protections." She confirmed that the SELC is evaluating its options to move forward with its efforts to confront xAI and demand more transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To community members, the health department's decision to grant the permits without probing xAI's alleged unlawful operations over the past year was "devastating," KeShaun Pearson, director of Memphis Community Against Pollution, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are deeply disappointed and oppose the decision by our Shelby County Health Department to approve the permit without meaningfully addressing the unlawful use of turbines on the site," Pearson said. "Our local leaders are entrusted with protecting us from corporations violating on our right to clean air, but we are witnessing their failure to do so. We are devastated, yet we remain determined to the mission of justice for our families in South Memphis who are overburdened with air pollution."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI and the Shelby County Health Department did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Critics demand more transparency from xAI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While critics continue to fight for more transparency, they also acknowledge that the overdue air permit at least suggests that some of xAI's feared pollution could be checked in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Before xAI got the permit, residents were stuck relying on infrequent thermal imaging to determine how many turbines appeared to be running without BACT. Now that xAI has secured the permit, the company will be required to "record the date, time, and durations of all startups, shutdowns, malfunctions, and tuning events" and "always minimize emissions including startup, shutdown, maintenance, and combustion tuning periods."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These records—which also document fuel usage, facility-wide emissions, and excess emissions—must be shared with the health department semiannually, with xAI's first report due by December 31. Additionally, xAI must maintain five years of "monitoring, preventive, and maintenance records for air pollution control equipment," which the department can request to review at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Memphis residents worried about smog-forming pollution, the worst fear would likely be visibly detecting the pollution. Mitigating this, xAI's air permit requires that visible emissions "from each emission point at the facility shall not exceed" 20 percent in opacity for more than minutes in any one-hour period or more than 20 minutes in any 24-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also prevents xAI from operating turbines all the time, limiting xAI to "a maximum of 22 startup events and 22 shutdown events per year" for the 15 turbines included in the permit, "with a total combined duration of 110 hours annually." Additionally, it specifies that each startup or shutdown event must not exceed one hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior communications manager for the SELC, Eric Hilt, told Ars that the "SELC and our partners intend to continue monitoring xAI's operations in the Memphis area." He further noted that the air permit does not address all of citizens' concerns at a time when xAI is planning to build another data center in the area, sparking new questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While these permits increase the amount of public information and accountability around 15 of xAI's turbines, there are still significant concerns around transparency—both for xAI's first South Memphis data center near the Boxtown neighborhood and the planned data center in the Whitehaven neighborhood," Hilt said. "XAI has not said how that second data center will be powered or if it plans to use gas turbines for that facility as well."&lt;/p&gt;

The moratorium would have prohibited states from receiving federal broadband expansion funds if they regulated AI—however, it faced procedural and political challenges in the Senate, and was ultimately removed in a vote of 99-1. Here’s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A watered-down moratorium cleared the Byrd Rule. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;In an attempt to bypass the Byrd Rule, which prohibits policy provisions in budget bills, the Senate Commerce Committee &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/05/congress/senate-commerce-megabill-frees-spectrum-ties-bead-to-ai-moratorium-00391136" rel="rel"&gt;revised&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the original moratorium to be a prerequisite for states to receive federal broadband expansion funds rather than a blanket restriction.

Senators Josh Hawley and Maria Cantwell were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/tech/ted-cruz-parliamentarian-artificial-intelligence/" rel="rel"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to bring an amendment to remove the moratorium from the bill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ted Cruz and Sen. Marsha Blackburn—another critic of the original moratorium—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/29/congress/blackburn-cruz-find-potential-truce-on-state-ai-moratorium-child-safety-00432296" rel="rel"&gt;were set&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to pitch a compromise &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/178AE7B5-7583-415E-8CF3-475241C6E5F9" rel="rel"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that shortened the moratorium from ten to five years and exempt state legislation establishing internet protections.

While both judges sided with the AI companies, they sharply disagreed about how the Copyright Act should apply to similar cases—leaving legal precedent on the question ambiguous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One judge ruled that training Anthropic’s Claude on copyrighted books is fair use. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;U.S. District Judge William Alsup &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/anthropic-wins-key-ruling-ai-authors-copyright-lawsuit-2025-06-24/" rel="rel"&gt;granted a summary judgment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that Anthropic using copyrighted books to train LLMs qualifies as fair use. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.434709/gov.uscourts.cand.434709.231.0_2.pdf" rel="rel"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; held that three out of four of the factors considered when determining whether a given use of a copyrighted work is a fair use favored Anthropic’s use in training LLMs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The purpose and character of the use. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The court held that using copyrighted books to train LLMs is highly transformative, favoring fair use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nature of the copyrighted work. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The books in question were expressive, pointing against fair use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The amount and substantiality of the portion used. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The court held that it was reasonably necessary to use the entirety of books in training LLMs, favoring fair use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;No exact copies or knockoffs resulted from the use of copyrighted books to train Claude, since Anthropic implemented guardrails to prevent Claude from exactly replicating the works on which it was trained. While the use may result in an “explosion” of AI-generated writing that competes with the copyrighted books, the court held that such a market effect doesn’t count under the Copyright Act.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitizing print books Anthropic lawfully bought is also protected—but piracy is not. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Judge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alsup drew a sharp line between scanning paperbacks Anthropic had purchased and the millions of volumes it admitted downloading from pirate libraries. Turning a lawfully owned print copy into a PDF is fair use, but pirating books is not. That issue will proceed to trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a case against Meta, another judge reached the opposite conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; While U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/meta-ai-copyright-lawsuit-sarah-silverman-e77968015b94fbbf38234e3178ede578" rel="rel"&gt;sided with Meta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in its case, his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.598.0_1.pdf" rel="rel"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; made clear he only did so because he believed the plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and presented the wrong evidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His analysis of whether using copyrighted books to train LLMs is fair use agrees with Judge Alsup’s on the first three factors—but sharply disagrees on the relevance of market effects. The upshot, he writes, is that “in many circumstances it will be illegal to copy copyright-protected works to train generative AI models without permission.” He sided with Mate only because the plaintiffs failed to provide arguments or evidence showing that Meta’s LLMs resulted in market harm to their books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The judges disagree on whether “indirect displacement” is a relevant market effect under the Copyright Act. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both orders assume that LLMs may now or soon be able to generate many competitors to human-written books, which could harm the market for human-written books.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Alsup writes that the authors’ complaint about such an effect is “no different than it would be if they complained that training schoolchildren to write well would result in an explosion of competing works,” which is “not the kind of competitive or creative displacement that concerns the Copyright Act.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Judge Chhabria responds that “using books to teach children to write is not remotely like using books to create a product that a single individual could employ to generate countless competing works with a miniscule fraction of the time and creativity it would otherwise take.” That is, he argues that a similarity in kind does not outweigh a vast difference in magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher courts will likely settle the dispute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; While Judge Alsup’s order might have provided precedence for similar cases, Chhabria’s disagreement leaves precedent ambiguous. However, both decisions fall under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, which has yet to rule on AI fair use. The authors in Anthropic’s case, at least, indicated that they will appeal the decision to the Ninth Circuit—and, ultimately, the issue may be up to the Supreme Court to decide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael C. Horowitz and Lauren A. Kahn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/nuclear-non-proliferation-is-the-wrong-framework-for-ai-governance" rel="rel"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that placing AI in a nuclear framework inflates expectations and distracts from practical, sector-specific governance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laura González Salmerón &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/can-copyright-survive-ai" rel="rel"&gt;discusses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; how copyright law is under pressure from generative AI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kristin O’Donoghue &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/congress-might-block-states-from-regulating-ai" rel="rel"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that a moratorium on state AI legislation would upend federalism and halt the experiments that drive smarter policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pete Buttigieg &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://petebuttigieg.substack.com/p/we-are-still-underreacting-on-ai" rel="rel"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a blog post arguing that AI presents “a fundamental change to our society—and we remain dangerously underprepared.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers at UC Berkeley released &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cybergym.io/" rel="rel"&gt;CyberGym&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a new cybersecurity benchmark.

The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.434709/gov.uscourts.cand.434709.231.0_2.pdf" rel="rel"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; held that three out of four of the factors considered when determining whether a given use of a copyrighted work is a fair use favored Anthropic’s use in training LLMs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The purpose and character of the use. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The court held that using copyrighted books to train LLMs is highly transformative, favoring fair use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nature of the copyrighted work. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The books in question were expressive, pointing against fair use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The amount and substantiality of the portion used. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The court held that it was reasonably necessary to use the entirety of books in training LLMs, favoring fair use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;No exact copies or knockoffs resulted from the use of copyrighted books to train Claude, since Anthropic implemented guardrails to prevent Claude from exactly replicating the works on which it was trained. While the use may result in an “explosion” of AI-generated writing that competes with the copyrighted books, the court held that such a market effect doesn’t count under the Copyright Act.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitizing print books Anthropic lawfully bought is also protected—but piracy is not. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Judge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alsup drew a sharp line between scanning paperbacks Anthropic had purchased and the millions of volumes it admitted downloading from pirate libraries. Turning a lawfully owned print copy into a PDF is fair use, but pirating books is not. That issue will proceed to trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a case against Meta, another judge reached the opposite conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; While U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/meta-ai-copyright-lawsuit-sarah-silverman-e77968015b94fbbf38234e3178ede578" rel="rel"&gt;sided with Meta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in its case, his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.598.0_1.pdf" rel="rel"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; made clear he only did so because he believed the plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and presented the wrong evidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His analysis of whether using copyrighted books to train LLMs is fair use agrees with Judge Alsup’s on the first three factors—but sharply disagrees on the relevance of market effects. The upshot, he writes, is that “in many circumstances it will be illegal to copy copyright-protected works to train generative AI models without permission.” He sided with Mate only because the plaintiffs failed to provide arguments or evidence showing that Meta’s LLMs resulted in market harm to their books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The judges disagree on whether “indirect displacement” is a relevant market effect under the Copyright Act. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both orders assume that LLMs may now or soon be able to generate many competitors to human-written books, which could harm the market for human-written books.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Alsup writes that the authors’ complaint about such an effect is “no different than it would be if they complained that training schoolchildren to write well would result in an explosion of competing works,” which is “not the kind of competitive or creative displacement that concerns the Copyright Act.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Judge Chhabria responds that “using books to teach children to write is not remotely like using books to create a product that a single individual could employ to generate countless competing works with a miniscule fraction of the time and creativity it would otherwise take.” That is, he argues that a similarity in kind does not outweigh a vast difference in magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher courts will likely settle the dispute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; While Judge Alsup’s order might have provided precedence for similar cases, Chhabria’s disagreement leaves precedent ambiguous. However, both decisions fall under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, which has yet to rule on AI fair use. The authors in Anthropic’s case, at least, indicated that they will appeal the decision to the Ninth Circuit—and, ultimately, the issue may be up to the Supreme Court to decide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael C.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I hope you’re having a harmonious day!” it writes. “I wanted to check in and see if you’ve discovered any new favorite soundtracks or composers recently. Or perhaps you’d like some recommendations for your next movie night? Let me know, and I’ll be happy to help!”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s a real example of what a sample AI persona named “The Maestro of Movie Magic” might send as a proactive message on Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram, per guidelines from data labeling firm Alignerr that Business Insider viewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The outlet learned through leaked documents that Meta is working with Alignerr to train customizable chatbots to reach out to users unprompted and follow up on any past conversations. That means the bots, which users can create in Meta’s AI Studio platform, also remember information about users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta confirmed that it was testing follow-up messaging with AIs to TechCrunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI chatbots will only send follow-ups within 14 days after a user initiates a conversation and if the user has sent at least five messages to the bot within that time frame. Meta says the chatbots won’t keep messaging if there’s no response to the first follow-up. Users can keep their bots private or share them through stories, direct links, and even display them on a Facebook or Instagram profile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This allows you to continue exploring topics of interest and engage in more meaningful conversations with the AIs across our apps,” a Meta spokesperson said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The technology is similar to that offered by AI startups like Character.AI and Replika. Both companies allow their chatbots to initiate conversations and ask questions in order to function as AI companions. Character.AI’s new CEO, Karandeep Anand, joined the team last month after serving as Meta’s VP of business products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But with engagement comes risk. Character.AI is undergoing an active lawsuit after allegations that one of the company’s bots played a role in the death of a 14-year-old boy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When asked how Meta plans to address safety to avoid situations like Character.AI’s, a spokesperson directed TechCrunch to a series of disclaimers. One of them warns that an AI’s response “may be inaccurate or inappropriate and should not be used to make important decisions.” Another says that the AIs aren’t licensed professionals or experts trained to help people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Chats with custom AIs can’t replace professional advice. You shouldn’t rely on AI chats for medical, psychological, financial, legal, or any other type of professional advice.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has also asked Meta if it imposes an age limit for engagement with its chatbots. A brief internet dive comes up with no company-imposed age limitations for using Meta AI, though laws in Tennessee and Puerto Rico limit teens from some engagement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the surface, the mission is aligned with Mark Zuckerberg’s quest to combat the “loneliness epidemic.” However, most of Meta’s business is built on advertising revenue, and the company has garnered a reputation for using algorithms to keep people scrolling, commenting, and liking, which correlates to more eyes on ads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In court documents that were unsealed in April, Meta predicted that its generative AI products would secure it $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue in 2025, and up to $1.4 trillion by 2035. Much, if not most, of that would come from Meta’s revenue-sharing agreements with companies that host its open Llama collection of models. The company said its AI assistant may eventually show ads and offer a subscription option.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta declined to comment on TechCrunch’s questions on how it plans to commercialize its AI chatbots, whether it plans to include ads or sponsored replies, and whether the company’s long-term strategy with AI companions involves integration with Horizon, Meta’s social virtual reality game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you look at the data: 6% of YC companies become unicorns, and of that 6% a quarter become decacorns,” Kulveer Taggar told TechCrunch. Taggar is a two-time YC alum best known for founding Zeus Living, a property management startup that raised over $150 million in funding.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taggar is so confident in the continuing return potential offered by the famed accelerator that he established Phosphor Capital, a venture firm dedicated solely to investing in YC companies. Since launching last year, Phosphor has raised $34 million in capital across two funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Phosphor isn’t the only venture capital firm focused on YC startups — Pioneer Fund and Rebel Fund employ similar strategies — the firm is the only dedicated YC fund led by a solo general partner. And because of Taggar’s long relationship with YC, he also nabbed YC CEO Garry Tan as an investor in the fund, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taggar’s relationship with Y Combinator began in 2007 when he, his cousin Harj Taggar, and future Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison brought their startup, Auctomatic, through the program. Although Auctomatic was sold just a year later, that experience was key to forging a strong connection with the top accelerator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He went through Y Combinator again in 2011, this time with Zeus Living, a startup that bought homes to offer furnished accommodations with flexible terms for business and personal travel. Initialized Capital, co-founded by current YC chief Garry Tan, led Zeus Living’s Series A funding and Tan joined its board.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its peak, the startup was valued at over $200 million and had an annual revenue run rate of about $120 million, according to Taggar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Zeus encountered significant headwinds when interest rates surged earlier this decade and the startup was sold to competitor Blueground in late 2023 for undisclosed terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taggar launched Phosphor mere months after leaving Zeus. He told TechCrunch he was particularly excited by the opportunity to invest in young AI startups and by Garry Tan’s leadership of the prestigious accelerator. “You could view this as a bet on Garry. I think he is taking Y Combinator to new levels,” Taggar said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike many emerging managers, Taggar had a relatively easy time raising capital. Beyond Tan, he says his other LPs include Zeus’ investors. “I had a relationship with them and a track record, so they knew me, and they knew how hard I work,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Others include family offices and a large asset manager who are taking a bet on Taggar in large part because of his deep connection and long-standing ties to Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Kulveer is what you might call an OG alum from the early days of YC,” said YC partner Jared Friedman. “He’s close to me and to many of the folks who now run YC.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taggar’s background as a YC alum and a founder was also a part of the draw to Phosphor for LPs and a benefit for founders. “Zeus was a really hard company to run. He has a tremendous number of battle scars from doing this hard thing in the physical world,” Friedman said. “I hear this from founders that he has incredible empathy for what they are going through, because he went through it all himself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Phosphor writes checks ranging from $100,000 to $500,000. The firm has already backed over 200 YC companies, with several going on to raise Series A funding, including workflow automation platform Gumloop and AI meeting manager Circleback.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CowanKulveer-0035.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Investing in Y Combinator startups can lead to significant returns to investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He went through Y Combinator again in 2011, this time with Zeus Living, a startup that bought homes to offer furnished accommodations with flexible terms for business and personal travel. Initialized Capital, co-founded by current YC chief Garry Tan, led Zeus Living’s Series A funding and Tan joined its board.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its peak, the startup was valued at over $200 million and had an annual revenue run rate of about $120 million, according to Taggar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Zeus encountered significant headwinds when interest rates surged earlier this decade and the startup was sold to competitor Blueground in late 2023 for undisclosed terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taggar launched Phosphor mere months after leaving Zeus. He told TechCrunch he was particularly excited by the opportunity to invest in young AI startups and by Garry Tan’s leadership of the prestigious accelerator. “You could view this as a bet on Garry. I think he is taking Y Combinator to new levels,” Taggar said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike many emerging managers, Taggar had a relatively easy time raising capital. Beyond Tan, he says his other LPs include Zeus’ investors. “I had a relationship with them and a track record, so they knew me, and they knew how hard I work,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Others include family offices and a large asset manager who are taking a bet on Taggar in large part because of his deep connection and long-standing ties to Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Kulveer is what you might call an OG alum from the early days of YC,” said YC partner Jared Friedman. “He’s close to me and to many of the folks who now run YC.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taggar’s background as a YC alum and a founder was also a part of the draw to Phosphor for LPs and a benefit for founders. “Zeus was a really hard company to run. He has a tremendous number of battle scars from doing this hard thing in the physical world,” Friedman said. “I hear this from founders that he has incredible empathy for what they are going through, because he went through it all himself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Phosphor writes checks ranging from $100,000 to $500,000. The firm has already backed over 200 YC companies, with several going on to raise Series A funding, including workflow automation platform Gumloop and AI meeting manager Circleback.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/y-combinator-alum-launched-a-new-34m-fund-dedicated-to-yc-startups-backed-by-garry-tan/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Meta’s “AI superintelligence” effort sounds just like its failed “metaverse” (AI – Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/metas-ai-superintelligence-effort-sounds-just-like-its-failed-metaverse/</link><description>&lt;article class="double-column h-entry post-2104300 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-ai category-gadgets tag-artificial-intelligence tag-facebook tag-meta tag-superhuman tag-superinteilligence tag-zuckerberg"&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a memo to employees earlier this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a vision for a near-future in which "personal [AI] superintelligence for everyone" forms "the beginning of a new era for humanity." The newly formed Meta Superintelligence Labs—freshly staffed with multiple high-level acquisitions from OpenAI and other AI companies—will spearhead the development of "our next generation of models to get to the frontier in the next year or so," Zuckerberg wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading that memo, I couldn't help but think of another "vision for the future" Zuckerberg shared not that long ago. At his 2021 Facebook Connect keynote, Zuckerberg laid out his plan for the metaverse, a virtual place where “you're gonna be able to do almost anything you can imagine" and which would form the basis of "the next version of the Internet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-1832297 align-fullwidth"&gt;

          Meta

                      
                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg believed in that vision so much at the time that he abandoned the well-known Facebook corporate brand in favor of the new name "Meta." "I'm going to keep pushing and giving everything I've got to make this happen now," Zuckerberg said at the time. Less than four years later, Zuckerberg seems to now be “giving everything [he's] got" for a vision of AI “superintelligence," reportedly offering pay packages of up to $300 million over four years to attract top talent from other AI companies (Meta has since denied those reports, saying, “The size and structure of these compensation packages have been misrepresented all over the place").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Zuckerberg is promising that this new technology will revolutionize our lives and replace the ways we currently socialize and work on the Internet. But the utter failure (so far) of those over-the-top promises for the metaverse has us more than a little skeptical of how impactful Zuckerberg’s vision of “personal superintelligence for everyone" will truly be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta-vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at Zuckerberg’s 2021 Facebook Connect keynote shows just how hard the company was selling the promise of the metaverse at the time. Zuckerberg said the metaverse would represent an “even more immersive and embodied Internet" where “everything we do online today—connecting socially, entertainment, games, work—is going to be more natural and vivid."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Mark Zuckerberg lays out his vision for the metaverse in 2021.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Teleporting around the metaverse is going to be like clicking a link on the Internet," Zuckerberg promised, and metaverse users would probably switch between “a photorealistic avatar for work, a stylized one for hanging out, and maybe even a fantasy one for gaming." This kind of personalization would lead to “hundreds of thousands" of artists being able to make a living selling virtual metaverse goods that could be embedded in virtual or real-world environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lots of things that are physical today, like screens, will just be able to be holograms in the future," Zuckerberg promised. “You won't need a physical TV; it'll just be a one-dollar hologram from some high school kid halfway across the world… we'll be able to express ourselves in new joyful, completely immersive ways, and that's going to unlock a lot of amazing new experiences."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pre-rendered concept video showed metaverse users playing poker in a zero-gravity space station with robot avatars, then pausing briefly to appreciate some animated 3D art a friend had encountered on the street. Another video showed a young woman teleporting via metaverse avatar to virtually join a friend attending a live concert in Tokyo, then buying virtual merch from the concert at a metaverse afterparty from the comfort of her home. Yet another showed old men playing chess on a park bench, even though one of the players was sitting across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta-failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2025, and the current reality of Zuckerberg’s metaverse efforts bears almost no resemblance to anything shown or discussed back in 2021. Even enthusiasts describe Meta’s Horizon Worlds as a “depressing" and “lonely" experience characterized by “completely empty" venues. And Meta engineers anonymously gripe about metaverse tools that even employees actively avoid using and a messy codebase that was treated like “a 3D version of a mobile app. "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-1788691 align-fullwidth"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Even Meta employees reportedly don't want to work in Horizon Workrooms.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of a $50 million creator fund seems to have failed to encourage peeved creators to give the metaverse another chance. Things look a bit better if you expand your view past Meta’s own metaverse sandbox; the chaotic world of VR Chat attracts tens of thousands of daily users on Steam alone, for instance. Still, we’re a far cry from the replacement for the mobile Internet that Zuckerberg once trumpeted.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Then again, it’s possible that we just haven’t given Zuckerberg’s version of the metaverse enough time to develop. Back in 2021, he said that “a lot of this is going to be mainstream" within “the next five or 10 years." That timeframe gives Meta at least a few more years to develop and release its long-teased, lightweight augmented reality glasses that the company showed off last year in the form of a prototype that reportedly still costs $10,000 per unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2070873 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="fullwidth full" height="682" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2173579471.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Zuckerberg shows off prototype AR glasses that could change the way we think about "the metaverse."

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe those glasses will ignite widespread interest in the metaverse in a way that Meta’s bulky, niche VR goggles have utterly failed to. Regardless, after nearly four years and roughly $60 billion in VR-related losses, Meta thus far has surprisingly little to show for its massive investment in Zuckerberg’s metaverse vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our AI future?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hear Zuckerberg talk about the promise of AI these days, it’s hard not to hear echoes of his monumental vision for the metaverse from 2021. If anything, Zuckerberg’s vision of our AI-powered future is even more grandiose than his view of the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the metaverse, Zuckerberg now sees AI forming a replacement for the current version of the Internet. “Do you think in five years we’re just going to be sitting in our feed and consuming media that's just video?" Zuckerberg asked rhetorically in an April interview with Drawkesh Patel. “No, it's going to be interactive," he continued, envisioning something like Instagram Reels, but “you can talk to it, or interact with it, and it talks back, or it changes what it's doing. Or you can jump into it like a game and interact with it. That's all going to be AI."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Mark Zuckerberg talks about all the ways superhuman AI is going to change our lives in the near future.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the Metaverse, Zuckerberg sees AI as revolutionizing the way we interact with each other. He envisions “always-on video chats with the AI" incorporating expressions and body language borrowed from the company’s work on the metaverse. And our relationships with AI models are “just going to get more intense as these AIs become more unique, more personable, more intelligent, more spontaneous, more funny, and so forth," Zuckerberg said. "As the personalization loop kicks in and the AI starts to get to know you better and better, that will just be really compelling."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg did allow that relationships with AI would “probably not" replace in-person connections, because there are “things that are better about physical connections when you can have them." At the same time, he said, for the average American who has three friends, AI relationships can fill the “demand" for “something like 15 friends" without the effort of real-world socializing. “People just don't have as much connection as they want," Zuckerberg said. “They feel more alone a lot of the time than they would like."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg also sees AI leading to a flourishing of human productivity and creativity in a way even his wildest metaverse imaginings couldn’t match. Zuckerberg said that AI advancement could “lead toward a world of abundance where everyone has these superhuman tools to create whatever they want." That means personal access to “a super powerful [virtual] software engineer" and AIs that are “solving diseases, advancing science, developing new technology that makes our lives better."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will also mean that some companies will be able to get by with fewer employees before too long, Zuckerberg said. In customer service, for instance, “as AI gets better, you're going to get to a place where AI can handle a bunch of people's issues," he said. “Not all of them—maybe 10 years from now it can handle all of them—but thinking about a three- to five-year time horizon, it will be able to handle a bunch.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, Zuckerberg said, AIs will be integrated into our more casual pursuits as well. "If everyone has these superhuman tools to create a ton of different stuff, you're going to get incredible diversity," and "the amount of creativity that's going to be unlocked is going to be massive," he said. "I would guess the world is going to get a lot funnier, weirder, and quirkier, the way that memes on the Internet have gotten over the last 10 years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compare and contrast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there are some important differences between the past promise of the metaverse and the current promise of AI technology. Zuckerberg claims that a billion people use Meta’s AI products monthly, for instance, utterly dwarfing the highest estimates for regular use of “the metaverse" or augmented reality as a whole (even if many AI users seem to balk at paying for regular use of AI tools). Meta coders are also reportedly already using AI coding tools regularly in a way they never did with Meta’s metaverse tools. And people are already developing what they consider meaningful relationships with AI personas, whether that’s in the form of therapists or romantic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are reasons to be skeptical about the future of AI when current models still routinely hallucinate basic facts, show fundamental issues when attempting reasoning, and struggle with basic tasks like beating a children’s video game. The path from where we are to a supposed “superhuman" AI is not simple or inevitable, despite the handwaving of industry boosters like Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2021 rollout of Meta’s push to develop a metaverse, high-ranking Meta executives like John Carmack were at least up front about the technical and product-development barriers that could get in the way of Zuckerberg’s vision. "Everybody that wants to work on the metaverse talks about the limitless possibilities of it," Carmack said at the time (before departing the company in late 2022). "But it's not limitless. It is a challenge to fit things in, but you can make smarter decisions about exactly what is important and then really optimize the heck out of things."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, those kinds of voices of internal skepticism seem in short supply as Meta sets itself up to push AI in the same way it once backed the metaverse. Don’t be surprised, though, if today’s promise that we're at "the beginning of a new era for humanity" ages about as well as Meta’s former promises about a metaverse where "you're gonna be able to do almost anything you can imagine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a memo to employees earlier this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a vision for a near-future in which "personal [AI] superintelligence for everyone" forms "the beginning of a new era for humanity." The newly formed Meta Superintelligence Labs—freshly staffed with multiple high-level acquisitions from OpenAI and other AI companies—will spearhead the development of "our next generation of models to get to the frontier in the next year or so," Zuckerberg wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading that memo, I couldn't help but think of another "vision for the future" Zuckerberg shared not that long ago. At his 2021 Facebook Connect keynote, Zuckerberg laid out his plan for the metaverse, a virtual place where “you're gonna be able to do almost anything you can imagine" and which would form the basis of "the next version of the Internet."&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg believed in that vision so much at the time that he abandoned the well-known Facebook corporate brand in favor of the new name "Meta." "I'm going to keep pushing and giving everything I've got to make this happen now," Zuckerberg said at the time. Less than four years later, Zuckerberg seems to now be “giving everything [he's] got" for a vision of AI “superintelligence," reportedly offering pay packages of up to $300 million over four years to attract top talent from other AI companies (Meta has since denied those reports, saying, “The size and structure of these compensation packages have been misrepresented all over the place").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Zuckerberg is promising that this new technology will revolutionize our lives and replace the ways we currently socialize and work on the Internet. But the utter failure (so far) of those over-the-top promises for the metaverse has us more than a little skeptical of how impactful Zuckerberg’s vision of “personal superintelligence for everyone" will truly be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta-vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at Zuckerberg’s 2021 Facebook Connect keynote shows just how hard the company was selling the promise of the metaverse at the time. Zuckerberg said the metaverse would represent an “even more immersive and embodied Internet" where “everything we do online today—connecting socially, entertainment, games, work—is going to be more natural and vivid."&lt;/p&gt;

      Mark Zuckerberg lays out his vision for the metaverse in 2021.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Teleporting around the metaverse is going to be like clicking a link on the Internet," Zuckerberg promised, and metaverse users would probably switch between “a photorealistic avatar for work, a stylized one for hanging out, and maybe even a fantasy one for gaming." This kind of personalization would lead to “hundreds of thousands" of artists being able to make a living selling virtual metaverse goods that could be embedded in virtual or real-world environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lots of things that are physical today, like screens, will just be able to be holograms in the future," Zuckerberg promised. “You won't need a physical TV; it'll just be a one-dollar hologram from some high school kid halfway across the world… we'll be able to express ourselves in new joyful, completely immersive ways, and that's going to unlock a lot of amazing new experiences."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pre-rendered concept video showed metaverse users playing poker in a zero-gravity space station with robot avatars, then pausing briefly to appreciate some animated 3D art a friend had encountered on the street. Another video showed a young woman teleporting via metaverse avatar to virtually join a friend attending a live concert in Tokyo, then buying virtual merch from the concert at a metaverse afterparty from the comfort of her home. Yet another showed old men playing chess on a park bench, even though one of the players was sitting across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta-failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2025, and the current reality of Zuckerberg’s metaverse efforts bears almost no resemblance to anything shown or discussed back in 2021. Even enthusiasts describe Meta’s Horizon Worlds as a “depressing" and “lonely" experience characterized by “completely empty" venues. And Meta engineers anonymously gripe about metaverse tools that even employees actively avoid using and a messy codebase that was treated like “a 3D version of a mobile app. "&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of a $50 million creator fund seems to have failed to encourage peeved creators to give the metaverse another chance. Things look a bit better if you expand your view past Meta’s own metaverse sandbox; the chaotic world of VR Chat attracts tens of thousands of daily users on Steam alone, for instance. Still, we’re a far cry from the replacement for the mobile Internet that Zuckerberg once trumpeted.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Then again, it’s possible that we just haven’t given Zuckerberg’s version of the metaverse enough time to develop. Back in 2021, he said that “a lot of this is going to be mainstream" within “the next five or 10 years." That timeframe gives Meta at least a few more years to develop and release its long-teased, lightweight augmented reality glasses that the company showed off last year in the form of a prototype that reportedly still costs $10,000 per unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2070873 align-fullwidth"&gt;

      Zuckerberg shows off prototype AR glasses that could change the way we think about "the metaverse."

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe those glasses will ignite widespread interest in the metaverse in a way that Meta’s bulky, niche VR goggles have utterly failed to. Regardless, after nearly four years and roughly $60 billion in VR-related losses, Meta thus far has surprisingly little to show for its massive investment in Zuckerberg’s metaverse vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our AI future?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hear Zuckerberg talk about the promise of AI these days, it’s hard not to hear echoes of his monumental vision for the metaverse from 2021. If anything, Zuckerberg’s vision of our AI-powered future is even more grandiose than his view of the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the metaverse, Zuckerberg now sees AI forming a replacement for the current version of the Internet. “Do you think in five years we’re just going to be sitting in our feed and consuming media that's just video?" Zuckerberg asked rhetorically in an April interview with Drawkesh Patel. “No, it's going to be interactive," he continued, envisioning something like Instagram Reels, but “you can talk to it, or interact with it, and it talks back, or it changes what it's doing. Or you can jump into it like a game and interact with it. That's all going to be AI."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Mark Zuckerberg talks about all the ways superhuman AI is going to change our lives in the near future.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the Metaverse, Zuckerberg sees AI as revolutionizing the way we interact with each other. He envisions “always-on video chats with the AI" incorporating expressions and body language borrowed from the company’s work on the metaverse. And our relationships with AI models are “just going to get more intense as these AIs become more unique, more personable, more intelligent, more spontaneous, more funny, and so forth," Zuckerberg said. "As the personalization loop kicks in and the AI starts to get to know you better and better, that will just be really compelling."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg did allow that relationships with AI would “probably not" replace in-person connections, because there are “things that are better about physical connections when you can have them." At the same time, he said, for the average American who has three friends, AI relationships can fill the “demand" for “something like 15 friends" without the effort of real-world socializing. “People just don't have as much connection as they want," Zuckerberg said. “They feel more alone a lot of the time than they would like."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-1958135 align-fullwidth"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Why chat with real friends on Facebook when you can chat with AI avatars?

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg also sees AI leading to a flourishing of human productivity and creativity in a way even his wildest metaverse imaginings couldn’t match. Zuckerberg said that AI advancement could “lead toward a world of abundance where everyone has these superhuman tools to create whatever they want." That means personal access to “a super powerful [virtual] software engineer" and AIs that are “solving diseases, advancing science, developing new technology that makes our lives better."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will also mean that some companies will be able to get by with fewer employees before too long, Zuckerberg said. In customer service, for instance, “as AI gets better, you're going to get to a place where AI can handle a bunch of people's issues," he said. “Not all of them—maybe 10 years from now it can handle all of them—but thinking about a three- to five-year time horizon, it will be able to handle a bunch.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, Zuckerberg said, AIs will be integrated into our more casual pursuits as well. "If everyone has these superhuman tools to create a ton of different stuff, you're going to get incredible diversity," and "the amount of creativity that's going to be unlocked is going to be massive," he said. "I would guess the world is going to get a lot funnier, weirder, and quirkier, the way that memes on the Internet have gotten over the last 10 years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compare and contrast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there are some important differences between the past promise of the metaverse and the current promise of AI technology. Zuckerberg claims that a billion people use Meta’s AI products monthly, for instance, utterly dwarfing the highest estimates for regular use of “the metaverse" or augmented reality as a whole (even if many AI users seem to balk at paying for regular use of AI tools). Meta coders are also reportedly already using AI coding tools regularly in a way they never did with Meta’s metaverse tools. And people are already developing what they consider meaningful relationships with AI personas, whether that’s in the form of therapists or romantic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Still, there are reasons to be skeptical about the future of AI when current models still routinely hallucinate basic facts, show fundamental issues when attempting reasoning, and struggle with basic tasks like beating a children’s video game. The path from where we are to a supposed “superhuman" AI is not simple or inevitable, despite the handwaving of industry boosters like Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-1905416 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

      Artist's conception of Carmack's VR avatar waving goodbye to Meta.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2021 rollout of Meta’s push to develop a metaverse, high-ranking Meta executives like John Carmack were at least up front about the technical and product-development barriers that could get in the way of Zuckerberg’s vision. "Everybody that wants to work on the metaverse talks about the limitless possibilities of it," Carmack said at the time (before departing the company in late 2022). "But it's not limitless. It is a challenge to fit things in, but you can make smarter decisions about exactly what is important and then really optimize the heck out of things."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, those kinds of voices of internal skepticism seem in short supply as Meta sets itself up to push AI in the same way it once backed the metaverse. Don’t be surprised, though, if today’s promise that we're at "the beginning of a new era for humanity" ages about as well as Meta’s former promises about a metaverse where "you're gonna be able to do almost anything you can imagine."&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

Safe Superintelligence co-founder Daniel Levy is becoming president of the startup, according to Sutskever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement follows weeks of reporting that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was in advanced talks to hire Gross, as well as his longtime investing partner, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. At one point, Zuckerberg reportedly attempted to acquire all of Safe Superintelligence, a startup most recently valued at $32 billion. Sutskever addressed those reports as well.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You might have heard rumors of companies looking to acquire us. We are flattered by their attention but are focused on seeing our work through,” said Sutskever. “We have the compute, we have the team, and we know what to do. Together we will keep building safe superintelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;I sent the following message to our team and investors:&lt;br /&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you know, Daniel Gross’s time with us has been winding down, and as of June 29 he is officially no longer a part of SSI. We are grateful for his early contributions to the company and wish him well in his next…&lt;/p&gt;— Ilya Sutskever (@ilyasut) July 3, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Naturally, Gross’ departure may raise questions around the startup. If Safe Superintelligence was close to its goal — surely a groundbreaking technology, as it’s described — why would its co-founder leave to start something new, seemingly at Meta?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, Safe Superintelligence describes itself as the world’s “first straight-shot SSI lab,” meaning the company has no other products or ambitions outside of developing, well, safe superintelligence. That’s the name, that’s the product, that’s its whole thing. Sutskever started Safe Superintelligence shortly after leaving OpenAI, where he played a role in the brief ousting of CEO Sam Altman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, it seems likely that Meta Superintelligence Labs will develop technology that powers lots of the company’s products. In&amp;nbsp;Zuckerberg’s memo&amp;nbsp;announcing the new unit, he referenced Meta’s expertise in building and growing products that reach billions of people, and cited the early wins Meta has had in AI wearables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That means Gross, who previously led AI teams at Apple after the iPhone maker acquired his startup, could have a more familiar role at Meta, should he join. Zuckerberg has also nabbed some&amp;nbsp;top researchers from OpenAI&amp;nbsp;and Google DeepMind to fill out his new AI team.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nevertheless, Sutskever may have his hands full as Safe Superintelligence’s CEO. While he’s held previous high-ranking positions, such as OpenAI’s chief scientist, the CEO role may come with new challenges — such as raising new capital from investors and recruiting top talent. Sutskever notes in his post that he’ll continue to oversee Safe Superintelligence’s technical team.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ilyausutskever-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever says he is stepping into the CEO role at Safe Superintelligence, the AI startup he launched in 2024.&amp;nbsp;In a&amp;nbsp;post on X, Sutskever confirmed Thursday that Daniel Gross, the startup’s co-founder and CEO, departed the company as of June 29.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, Safe Superintelligence describes itself as the world’s “first straight-shot SSI lab,” meaning the company has no other products or ambitions outside of developing, well, safe superintelligence. That’s the name, that’s the product, that’s its whole thing. Sutskever started Safe Superintelligence shortly after leaving OpenAI, where he played a role in the brief ousting of CEO Sam Altman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, it seems likely that Meta Superintelligence Labs will develop technology that powers lots of the company’s products. In&amp;nbsp;Zuckerberg’s memo&amp;nbsp;announcing the new unit, he referenced Meta’s expertise in building and growing products that reach billions of people, and cited the early wins Meta has had in AI wearables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That means Gross, who previously led AI teams at Apple after the iPhone maker acquired his startup, could have a more familiar role at Meta, should he join. Zuckerberg has also nabbed some&amp;nbsp;top researchers from OpenAI&amp;nbsp;and Google DeepMind to fill out his new AI team.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nevertheless, Sutskever may have his hands full as Safe Superintelligence’s CEO. While he’s held previous high-ranking positions, such as OpenAI’s chief scientist, the CEO role may come with new challenges — such as raising new capital from investors and recruiting top talent. Sutskever notes in his post that he’ll continue to oversee Safe Superintelligence’s technical team.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/ilya-sutskever-will-lead-safe-superintelligence-following-his-ceos-exit/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 17:29:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Cloudflare wants AI companies to pay for content (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/podcast/why-cloudflare-wants-ai-companies-to-pay-for-content/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Matthew-Prince-CloudflareDSC00252.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="has-text-align-left wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cloudflare wants AI companies to pay up.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, hosts Kirsten Korosec and Max Zeff dig into Cloudflare’s big swing, why it’s a natural next step after a year of laying groundwork for bot-blocking tools, and whether the plan to sit at the center of a pay-for-content protocol is genius… or just wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

And when it comes to artificial intelligence, the conversations aren’t just technical — they’re creative, cinematic, and boundary-pushing. That’s why Nikola Todorovic is headed to the AI Stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A visual effects veteran turned AI entrepreneur, Todorovic is the co-founder of Wonder Dynamics, now an Autodesk company. Alongside actor and producer Tye Sheridan, he helped launch Autodesk Flow Studio (formerly Wonder Studio), a groundbreaking AI platform that allows creators to seamlessly integrate 3D characters into live-action scenes. The platform uses cloud-based tools to automate complex processes like lighting, animation, and composition, giving filmmakers a radically faster and more accessible path to high-end visual effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 Nikola Todorovic" class="wp-image-3024843" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TC25_Nikola-Todorovic-Speaker-16x9-Dark.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-film-meets-ai"&gt;Where film meets AI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Todorovic’s journey to this moment wasn’t traditional, but that’s exactly the point. As an award-winning filmmaker and VFX supervisor, he spent years working at the intersection of storytelling and technology. That experience led to Wonder Dynamics, where the mission has always been to empower artists, not replace them. The company’s acquisition by Autodesk in 2024 marked a major validation of that vision, and now Todorovic is helping shape the future of creative AI inside one of the industry’s biggest ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At Disrupt, he’ll join &lt;strong&gt;other AI industry leaders&lt;/strong&gt; for a wide-ranging panel on what’s coming next — from generative tools to ethical design to the future of creator workflows. Stay tuned to the fast-growing &lt;strong&gt;Disrupt agenda page&lt;/strong&gt; for the latest updates. Expect a conversation in Todorovic’s session that spans beyond buzzwords and dives into the real-world impact of AI in media and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

But rivals are coming. (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/cluelys-arr-doubled-in-a-week-to-7m-founder-roy-lee-says-but-rivals-are-coming/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG-0036-from-100CANON.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cluely’s revenue has skyrocketed to about $7 million in ARR since it launched its new enterprise product a week ago, founder Roy Lee told TechCrunch. “Every single person who has a meeting or an interview is testing this out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cluely, one of Silicon Valley’s most-talked-about startups, offers products that use AI to analyze online conversations, deliver real-time notes, provide context, and suggest questions to ask. This information appeared discreetly on the user’s screen, invisible to others.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For weeks leading up to the product reveal, Lee boasted that the company’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) exceeded $3 million and that the startup was profitable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The increase in interest is coming from consumers and businesses alike, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cluely is a startup born of controversy after Lee posted in a viral X thread saying he was suspended by Columbia University because he and a co-founder developed a tool to cheat on job interviews for software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He turned around and created a product and startup out of the tech, originally using the marketing tagline that it helps you “cheat on everything.” Now that it is backed by big-league VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, Abstract Ventures, and Susa Ventures, it has toned down its marketing to “Everything You Need. Before You Ask. … This feels like cheating.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It has turned into a Silicon Valley sensation from its rage-bait marketing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the startup’s controversial history hasn’t stopped businesses from showing interest in Cluely’s product, Lee insists, telling us that it has signed a public company that just this week doubled its annual contract with Cluely to $2.5 million. Lee declined to name the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The enterprise version of the product is similar to the consumer offering, but it comes with some extra features such as team management and additional security settings, Lee said. Business use cases include sales calls, customer support, and remote tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Which Cluely features are the most interesting to customers? According to Lee, it’s Cluely’s ability to take real-time notes.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Meeting notes have been a proven very sticky, very interesting AI use case. The only problem with them is they’re all post-call,” Lee said of competitors’ products. “You want to look back at them in the middle of a meeting, and that is what we offer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Cluely’s real-time notetaker may be easy to replicate. On Thursday, Pickle, a company that describes itself as a digital clone factory, claimed on X that it built Glass, an open source, free product with very similar functionality to Cluely. By mid-day it had already garnered over 850 stars and been forked nearly 150 times — indicating that the open source developer community is giving this free version a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Time will tell if Cluely’s meteoric rise can withstand competition from free copycat products like Glass.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG-0036-from-100CANON.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cluely’s revenue has skyrocketed to about $7 million in ARR since it launched its new enterprise product a week ago, founder Roy Lee told TechCrunch. “Every single person who has a meeting or an interview is testing this out.”&lt;/p&gt;
