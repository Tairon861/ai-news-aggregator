The idea behind the glasses is to give delivery drivers a hands-free experience that reduces the need to keep looking between their phone, the package they’re delivering, and their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The e-commerce giant says the glasses will allow delivery drivers to scan packages, follow turn-by-turn walking directions, and capture proof of delivery, all without using their phones. The glasses use AI-powered sensing capabilities and computer vision alongside cameras to create a display that includes things like hazards and delivery tasks. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon likely hopes that the new glasses will shave time off of each delivery by providing delivery drivers with detailed directions and information about hazards directly in their line of sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060965" height="375" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-22-at-2.18.57PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When a driver parks at a delivery location, Amazon says the glasses automatically activate. The glasses help the driver locate the package inside the vehicle and then navigate to the delivery address. The glasses can provide easy-to-follow directions in places like multi-unit apartment complexes and business locations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The glasses are paired with a controller worn in the delivery vest that contains operational controls, a swappable battery, and a dedicated emergency button. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon notes that the glasses also support prescription lenses and transitional lenses that automatically adjust to light. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060966" height="373" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-22-at-2.19.04PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The retailer is currently trialing the glasses with delivery drivers in North America and plans to refine the technology before a wider rollout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as Reuters reported last year that Amazon was working on the smart glasses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the future, Amazon says the glasses will be able to provide drivers with “real-time defect detection” that could notify them if they accidentally drop off a package at the wrong address. The glasses will also be able to detect pets in yards and automatically adjust to hazards like low light conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also on Wednesday, Amazon unveiled a new robotic arm called “Blue Jay” that can work alongside warehouse employees to pick items off shelves and sort them. Additionally, the tech giant announced a new AI tool called Eluna that will help provide operational insights at Amazon warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Amazon announced on Wednesday that it’s developing AI-powered smart glasses for its delivery drivers.

There are other AI browsers such as The Browser Company’s Dia, Opera’s Neon, Perplexity’s Comet, and General Catalyst-backed Strawberry. OpenAI’s launch is notable because of the sheer scale of reaching potentially 800 million of its weekly ChatGPT users. For the company, the browser is much more about keeping ChatGPT central than about making web browsing better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Atlas is currently available only on the Mac, the company is already working on bringing it to Windows, iOS, and Android — all the surfaces where ChatGPT already exists. OpenAI has also made the browser available to all users instead of opting for an invite system like its rivals. The core proposition of the browser is for you to think of ChatGPT as the first interaction surface for search and answers instead of Google.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All the AI browsers share a similar idea about search and Q&amp;amp;A. Instead of performing a search query, you would type something in your address bar to get answers from an AI chatbot, instead of looking at pages of links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And OpenAI, just like other browser makers, thinks that Atlas will change the way you browse the web, as Sam Altman made clear at the launch. “We think AI represents once in a decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be, how to use one, and how to most productively use the web. Tabs were great but there hasn’t been a lot of innovation since then,” Altman said in his opening speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech leaders, including Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella, have talked about AI as a platform shift. However, for consumers, phones and desktop operating systems are still the primary way to get to their AI tools. OpenAI wants to own the pipes of distribution of ChatGPT as much as it can. Last week, Meta shut its doors to third-party chatbots, including ChatGPT and Perplexity on WhatsApp, which has over 3 billion monthly users. This essentially means that the platform owners could put the brakes on distribution at any point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For OpenAI, Atlas will also present an opportunity to deeply integrate ChatGPT and other products better than other platforms can. Users can directly reference multiple websites instead of posting links to ChatGPT. The company already uses a headless browser for its agent. With Atlas, it might have more control over the feature. It has already integrated a hovering writing assistant that shows up in text fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060764" height="167" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-22-at-5.01.03PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch (screenshot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What’s more, the company is working on integrating its App SDK, which lets you call other apps within ChatGPT, to improve discoverability. &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The memory feature is also key for ChatGPT’s power users. The feature takes into account the browsing history, along with your ChatGPT history, to provide answers with that context in mind. You can ask, “What was the work document I had my presentation plan on?” and ChatGPT will fetch that link for you. This also means that ChatGPT gets more context about you as you spend more time in the browser. OpenAI can use this context and provide it to other apps when it starts rolling out Sign in with ChatGPT widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both features — making ChatGPT the default search option and enabling memory — are designed to gather more user data, giving OpenAI greater insight into user behavior and enabling better product development. The browser doesn’t have an ad-blocker, a VPN, a reading mode, or a translate feature to make the browsing experience better for a site. Rather, users have to ask ChatGPT to summarize content or find something on a page — as if opening a page is designed to give ChatGPT more context rather than to help users consume the content on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In contrast, The Browser Company’s Arc has some useful ideas around revamping the browser experience, like using AI to rename downloaded files or customize a web page by letting you remove elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060766" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Memory.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The result is more than a browser; it’s a broader canvas for ChatGPT itself. OpenAI’s CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, laid out this idea in her blog outlining the Atlas launch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When we first released ChatGPT, we weren’t sure how people would use it. Now that we have feedback and signals from hundreds of millions of people around the world, it’s clear ChatGPT needs to become so much more than the simple chatbot it started as. Over time, we see ChatGPT evolving to become the operating system for your life: a fully connected hub that helps you manage your day and achieve your long-term goals,” Simo said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The big question for OpenAI is how to make people, whose default browser is Chrome, Safari, or Edge, switch to its own browser and get some market share out of Google, Apple, and Microsoft’s hands. OpenAI is seeing steady growth in the number of people using ChatGPT. But it is not clear whether an average user would want to mix their browser and chatbot experience just yet. Chrome succeeded because it was fast, and people wanted to use Google queries as the default starting experience of the internet. ChatGPT Atlas is perfect for users who have replaced Google with ChatGPT, but to replace Chrome, OpenAI needs to make sure that billions of users fall into that habit.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI unveiled its AI browser, ChatGPT Atlas, during a livestream on Tuesday.

            &lt;p&gt;On Oct. 20 during its annual meeting, the National Academy of Medicine announced the election of 100 new members, including MIT faculty members Dina Katabi and Facundo Batista, along with three additional MIT alumni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Election to the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) is considered one of the highest honors in the fields of health and medicine, recognizing individuals who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facundo Batista is the associate director and scientific director of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, as well as the first Phillip T. and Susan M. Ragon Professor in the MIT Department of Biology. The National Academy of Medicine recognized Batista for “his work unraveling the biology of antibody-producing B cells to better understand how our body’s immune systems responds to infectious disease.” More recently, Facundo’s research has advanced preclinical vaccine and therapeutic development for globally important diseases including HIV, malaria, and influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batista earned a PhD from the International School of Advanced Studies and established his lab in 2002 as a member of the Francis Crick Institute (formerly the London Research Institute), simultaneously holding a professorship at Imperial College London. In 2016, he joined the Ragon Institute to pursue a new research program applying his expertise in B cells and antibody responses to vaccine development, and preclinical vaccinology for diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. Batista is an elected fellow or member of the U.K. Academy of Medical Sciences, the American Academy of Microbiology, the Academia de Ciencias de América Latina, and the European Molecular Biology Organization, and he is chief editor of &lt;em&gt;The EMBO Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dina Katabi SM ’99, PhD ’03 is the Thuan (1990) and Nicole Pham Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. Her research spans digital health, wireless sensing, mobile computing, machine learning, and computer vision. Katabi’s contributions include efficient communication protocols for the internet, advanced contactless biosensors, and novel AI models that interpret physiological signals. The NAM recognized Katabi for “pioneering digital health technology that enables non-invasive, off-body remote health monitoring via AI and wireless signals, and for developing digital biomarkers for Parkinson’s progression and detection. She has translated this technology to advance objective, sensitive measures of disease trajectory and treatment response in clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katabi is director of the MIT Center for Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing. She is also a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), where she leads the Networks at MIT Research Group. Katabi received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Damascus and MS and PhD degrees in computer science from MIT. She is a MacArthur Fellow; a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, National Academy of Sciences, and National Academy of Engineering; and a recipient of the ACM Computing Prize.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional MIT alumni who were elected to the NAM for 2025 are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Christopher S. Chen SM ’93, PhD ’97, an alumnus of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael E. Matheny SM ’06, an alumnus of the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology; and&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rebecca R. Richards-Kortum SM ’87, PhD ’90, and alumna of the Department of Physics and the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Established originally as the Institute of Medicine in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine addresses critical issues in health, science, medicine, and related policy, and inspires positive actions across sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am deeply honored to welcome these extraordinary health and medicine leaders and researchers into the National Academy of Medicine,” says NAM President Victor J.

            &lt;p&gt;On Oct. 20 during its annual meeting, the National Academy of Medicine announced the election of 100 new members, including MIT faculty members Dina Katabi and Facundo Batista, along with three additional MIT alumni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Election to the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) is considered one of the highest honors in the fields of health and medicine, recognizing individuals who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facundo Batista is the associate director and scientific director of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, as well as the first Phillip T. and Susan M. Ragon Professor in the MIT Department of Biology. The National Academy of Medicine recognized Batista for “his work unraveling the biology of antibody-producing B cells to better understand how our body’s immune systems responds to infectious disease.” More recently, Facundo’s research has advanced preclinical vaccine and therapeutic development for globally important diseases including HIV, malaria, and influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batista earned a PhD from the International School of Advanced Studies and established his lab in 2002 as a member of the Francis Crick Institute (formerly the London Research Institute), simultaneously holding a professorship at Imperial College London. In 2016, he joined the Ragon Institute to pursue a new research program applying his expertise in B cells and antibody responses to vaccine development, and preclinical vaccinology for diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. Batista is an elected fellow or member of the U.K. Academy of Medical Sciences, the American Academy of Microbiology, the Academia de Ciencias de América Latina, and the European Molecular Biology Organization, and he is chief editor of &lt;em&gt;The EMBO Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dina Katabi SM ’99, PhD ’03 is the Thuan (1990) and Nicole Pham Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. Her research spans digital health, wireless sensing, mobile computing, machine learning, and computer vision. Katabi’s contributions include efficient communication protocols for the internet, advanced contactless biosensors, and novel AI models that interpret physiological signals. The NAM recognized Katabi for “pioneering digital health technology that enables non-invasive, off-body remote health monitoring via AI and wireless signals, and for developing digital biomarkers for Parkinson’s progression and detection. She has translated this technology to advance objective, sensitive measures of disease trajectory and treatment response in clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katabi is director of the MIT Center for Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing. She is also a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), where she leads the Networks at MIT Research Group. Katabi received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Damascus and MS and PhD degrees in computer science from MIT. She is a MacArthur Fellow; a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, National Academy of Sciences, and National Academy of Engineering; and a recipient of the ACM Computing Prize.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional MIT alumni who were elected to the NAM for 2025 are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Christopher S. Chen SM ’93, PhD ’97, an alumnus of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael E. Matheny SM ’06, an alumnus of the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology; and&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rebecca R. Richards-Kortum SM ’87, PhD ’90, and alumna of the Department of Physics and the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Established originally as the Institute of Medicine in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine addresses critical issues in health, science, medicine, and related policy, and inspires positive actions across sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am deeply honored to welcome these extraordinary health and medicine leaders and researchers into the National Academy of Medicine,” says NAM President Victor J. Dzau. “Their demonstrated excellence in tackling public health challenges, leading major discoveries, improving health care, advancing health policy, and addressing health equity will critically strengthen our collective ability to tackle the most pressing health challenges of our time.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once upon a time, two villagers visited the fabled Mullah Nasreddin. They hoped that the Sufi philosopher, famed for his acerbic wisdom, could mediate a dispute that had driven a wedge between them. Nasreddin listened patiently to the first villager’s version of the story and, upon its conclusion, exclaimed, “You are absolutely right!” The second villager then presented his case. After hearing him out, Nasreddin again responded, “You are absolutely right!” An observant bystander, confused by Nasreddin’s proclamations, interjected, “But Mullah, they can’t both be right.” Nasreddin paused, regarding the bystander for a moment before replying, “You are absolutely right, too!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late May, the White House’s first “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) report was criticized for citing multiple research studies that did not exist. Fabricated citations like these are common in the outputs of generative artificial intelligence based on large language models, or LLMs. LLMs have presented plausible-sounding sources, catchy titles, or even false data to craft their conclusions. Here, the White House pushed back on the journalists who first broke the story before admitting to “minor citation errors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is ironic that fake citations were used to support a principal recommendation of the MAHA report: addressing the health research sector’s “replication crisis,” wherein scientists’ findings often cannot be reproduced by other independent teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the MAHA report’s use of phantom evidence is far from unique. Last year, The Washington Post reported on dozens of instances in which AI-generated falsehoods found their way into courtroom proceedings. Once uncovered, lawyers had to explain to judges how fictitious cases, citations, and decisions found their way into trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these widely recognized problems, the MAHA roadmap released last month directs the Department of Health and Human Services to prioritize AI research to “…assist in earlier diagnosis, personalized treatment plans, real-time monitoring, and predictive interventions…” This breathless rush to embed AI in so many aspects of medicine could be forgiven if we believe that the technology’s “hallucinations” will be easy to fix through version updates. But as the industry itself acknowledges, these ghosts in the machine may be impossible to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of accelerating AI use in health research for clinical decision making. Beyond the problems we’re seeing here, using AI in research without disclosure could create a feedback loop, supercharging the very biases that helped motivate its use. Once published, “research” based on false results and citations could become part of the datasets used to build future AI systems. Worse still, a recently published study highlights an industry of scientific fraudsters who could deploy AI to make their claims seem more legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, a blind adoption of AI risks a downward spiral, where today’s flawed AI outputs become tomorrow’s training data, exponentially eroding research quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three prongs of AI misuse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge AI poses is threefold: hallucination, sycophancy, and the black box conundrum. Understanding these phenomena is critical for research scientists, policymakers, educators, and everyday citizens. Unaware, we risk vulnerability to deception as AI systems are increasingly deployed to shape diagnoses, insurance claims, health literacy, research, and public policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how hallucination works: When a user inputs a query into an AI tool such as ChatGPT or Gemini, the model evaluates the input and generates a string of words that is statistically likely to make sense based on its training data. Current AI models will complete this task even if their training data is incomplete or biased, filling in the blanks regardless of their ability to answer. These hallucinations can take the form of nonexistent research studies, misinformation, or even clinical interactions that never happened. LLMs’ emphasis on producing authoritative-sounding language shrouds their false outputs in a facsimile of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as human model trainers fine-tune generative AI responses, they tend to optimize and reward the AI system responses that favor their prior beliefs, leading to sycophancy. Human bias, it appears, begets AI bias, and human users of AI then perpetuate the cycle. A consequence is that AIs skew toward favoring pleasing answers over truthful ones, often seeking to reinforce the bias of the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent illustration of this occurred in April, when OpenAI canceled a ChatGPT update for being too sycophantic after users demonstrated that it agreed too quickly and enthusiastically with the assumptions embedded in users’ queries. Sycophancy and hallucination often interact with each other; systems that aim to please will be more apt to fabricate data to reach user-preferred conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correcting hallucinations, sycophancy, and other LLM mishaps is cumbersome because human observers can’t always determine how an AI platform arrived at its conclusions. This is the “black box” problem. Behind the probabilistic mathematics, is it even testing hypotheses? What methods did it use to derive an answer? Unlike traditional computer code or the rubric of scientific methodology, AI models operate through billions of computations. Looking at some well-structured outputs, it is easy to forget that the underlying processes are impenetrable to scrutiny and vastly different from a human’s approach to problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;This opacity can become dangerous when people can’t identify where computations went wrong, making it impossible to correct systematic errors or biases in the decision-making process. In health care, this black box raises questions about accountability, liability, and trust when neither physicians nor patients can explain the sequence of reasoning that leads to a medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI and health research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These AI challenges can exacerbate the existing sources of error and bias that creep into traditional health research publications. Several sources originate from the natural human motivation to find and publish meaningful, positive results. Journalists want to report on connections, e.g., that St. John’s Wort improves mood (it might). Nobody would want to publish an article with the results: “the supplement has no significant effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem compounds when researchers use a study design to test not just a single hypothesis but many. One quirk of statistics-backed research is that testing more hypotheses in a single study raises the likelihood of uncovering a spurious coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI has the potential to supercharge these coincidences through its relentless ability to test hypotheses across massive datasets. In the past, a research assistant could use an existing dataset to test 10 to 20 of the most likely hypotheses; now, that assistant can set an AI loose to test millions of likely or unlikely hypotheses without human supervision. That all but guarantees some of the results will meet the criteria for statistical significance, regardless of whether the data includes any real biological effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI’s tireless capacity to investigate data, combined with its growing ability to develop authoritative-sounding narratives, expands the potential to elevate fabricated or bias-confirming errors into the collective public consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the missives of AI luminaries, it would appear that society is on the cusp of superintelligence, which will transform every vexing societal conundrum into a trivial puzzle. While that’s highly unlikely, AI has certainly demonstrated promise in some health applications, despite its limitations. Unfortunately, it’s now being rapidly deployed sector-wide, even in areas where it has no prior track record.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;This speed may leave us little time to reflect on the accountability needed for safe deployment. Sycophancy, hallucination, and the black box of AI are non-trivial challenges when conjoined with existing biases in health research. If people can’t easily understand the inner workings of current AI tools (often comprising up to 1.8 trillion parameters), they will not be able to understand the process of future, more complex versions (using over 5 trillion parameters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History shows that most technological leaps forward are double-edged swords. Electronic health records increased the ability of clinicians to improve care coordination and aggregate data on population health, but they have eroded doctor-patient interactions and have become a source of physician burnout. The recent proliferation of telemedicine has expanded access to care, but it has also promoted lower-quality interactions with no physical examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of AI in health policy and research is no different. Wisely deployed, it could transform the health sector, leading to healthier populations and unfathomable breakthroughs (for example, by accelerating drug discovery). But without embedding it in new professional norms and practices, it has the potential to generate countless flawed leads and falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some potential solutions we see to the AI and health replicability crisis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clinical-specific models capable of admitting uncertainty in their outputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater transparency, requiring disclosure of AI model use in research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training for researchers, clinicians, and journalists on how to evaluate and stress-test AI-derived conclusions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-registered hypotheses and analysis plans before using AI tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI audit trails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific AI global prompts that limit sycophantic tendencies across user queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the solutions deployed, we need to solve the failure points described here to fully realize the potential of AI for use in health research. The public, AI companies, and health researchers must be active participants in this journey. After all, in science, not everyone can be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once upon a time, two villagers visited the fabled Mullah Nasreddin. They hoped that the Sufi philosopher, famed for his acerbic wisdom, could mediate a dispute that had driven a wedge between them. Nasreddin listened patiently to the first villager’s version of the story and, upon its conclusion, exclaimed, “You are absolutely right!” The second villager then presented his case. After hearing him out, Nasreddin again responded, “You are absolutely right!” An observant bystander, confused by Nasreddin’s proclamations, interjected, “But Mullah, they can’t both be right.” Nasreddin paused, regarding the bystander for a moment before replying, “You are absolutely right, too!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late May, the White House’s first “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) report was criticized for citing multiple research studies that did not exist. Fabricated citations like these are common in the outputs of generative artificial intelligence based on large language models, or LLMs. LLMs have presented plausible-sounding sources, catchy titles, or even false data to craft their conclusions. Here, the White House pushed back on the journalists who first broke the story before admitting to “minor citation errors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is ironic that fake citations were used to support a principal recommendation of the MAHA report: addressing the health research sector’s “replication crisis,” wherein scientists’ findings often cannot be reproduced by other independent teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the MAHA report’s use of phantom evidence is far from unique. Last year, The Washington Post reported on dozens of instances in which AI-generated falsehoods found their way into courtroom proceedings. Once uncovered, lawyers had to explain to judges how fictitious cases, citations, and decisions found their way into trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these widely recognized problems, the MAHA roadmap released last month directs the Department of Health and Human Services to prioritize AI research to “…assist in earlier diagnosis, personalized treatment plans, real-time monitoring, and predictive interventions…” This breathless rush to embed AI in so many aspects of medicine could be forgiven if we believe that the technology’s “hallucinations” will be easy to fix through version updates. But as the industry itself acknowledges, these ghosts in the machine may be impossible to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of accelerating AI use in health research for clinical decision making. Beyond the problems we’re seeing here, using AI in research without disclosure could create a feedback loop, supercharging the very biases that helped motivate its use. Once published, “research” based on false results and citations could become part of the datasets used to build future AI systems. Worse still, a recently published study highlights an industry of scientific fraudsters who could deploy AI to make their claims seem more legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, a blind adoption of AI risks a downward spiral, where today’s flawed AI outputs become tomorrow’s training data, exponentially eroding research quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three prongs of AI misuse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge AI poses is threefold: hallucination, sycophancy, and the black box conundrum. Understanding these phenomena is critical for research scientists, policymakers, educators, and everyday citizens. Unaware, we risk vulnerability to deception as AI systems are increasingly deployed to shape diagnoses, insurance claims, health literacy, research, and public policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how hallucination works: When a user inputs a query into an AI tool such as ChatGPT or Gemini, the model evaluates the input and generates a string of words that is statistically likely to make sense based on its training data. Current AI models will complete this task even if their training data is incomplete or biased, filling in the blanks regardless of their ability to answer. These hallucinations can take the form of nonexistent research studies, misinformation, or even clinical interactions that never happened. LLMs’ emphasis on producing authoritative-sounding language shrouds their false outputs in a facsimile of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as human model trainers fine-tune generative AI responses, they tend to optimize and reward the AI system responses that favor their prior beliefs, leading to sycophancy. Human bias, it appears, begets AI bias, and human users of AI then perpetuate the cycle. A consequence is that AIs skew toward favoring pleasing answers over truthful ones, often seeking to reinforce the bias of the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent illustration of this occurred in April, when OpenAI canceled a ChatGPT update for being too sycophantic after users demonstrated that it agreed too quickly and enthusiastically with the assumptions embedded in users’ queries. Sycophancy and hallucination often interact with each other; systems that aim to please will be more apt to fabricate data to reach user-preferred conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correcting hallucinations, sycophancy, and other LLM mishaps is cumbersome because human observers can’t always determine how an AI platform arrived at its conclusions. This is the “black box” problem. Behind the probabilistic mathematics, is it even testing hypotheses? What methods did it use to derive an answer? Unlike traditional computer code or the rubric of scientific methodology, AI models operate through billions of computations. Looking at some well-structured outputs, it is easy to forget that the underlying processes are impenetrable to scrutiny and vastly different from a human’s approach to problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;This opacity can become dangerous when people can’t identify where computations went wrong, making it impossible to correct systematic errors or biases in the decision-making process. In health care, this black box raises questions about accountability, liability, and trust when neither physicians nor patients can explain the sequence of reasoning that leads to a medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI and health research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These AI challenges can exacerbate the existing sources of error and bias that creep into traditional health research publications. Several sources originate from the natural human motivation to find and publish meaningful, positive results. Journalists want to report on connections, e.g., that St. John’s Wort improves mood (it might). Nobody would want to publish an article with the results: “the supplement has no significant effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem compounds when researchers use a study design to test not just a single hypothesis but many. One quirk of statistics-backed research is that testing more hypotheses in a single study raises the likelihood of uncovering a spurious coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI has the potential to supercharge these coincidences through its relentless ability to test hypotheses across massive datasets. In the past, a research assistant could use an existing dataset to test 10 to 20 of the most likely hypotheses; now, that assistant can set an AI loose to test millions of likely or unlikely hypotheses without human supervision. That all but guarantees some of the results will meet the criteria for statistical significance, regardless of whether the data includes any real biological effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI’s tireless capacity to investigate data, combined with its growing ability to develop authoritative-sounding narratives, expands the potential to elevate fabricated or bias-confirming errors into the collective public consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the missives of AI luminaries, it would appear that society is on the cusp of superintelligence, which will transform every vexing societal conundrum into a trivial puzzle. While that’s highly unlikely, AI has certainly demonstrated promise in some health applications, despite its limitations. Unfortunately, it’s now being rapidly deployed sector-wide, even in areas where it has no prior track record.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;This speed may leave us little time to reflect on the accountability needed for safe deployment. Sycophancy, hallucination, and the black box of AI are non-trivial challenges when conjoined with existing biases in health research. If people can’t easily understand the inner workings of current AI tools (often comprising up to 1.8 trillion parameters), they will not be able to understand the process of future, more complex versions (using over 5 trillion parameters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History shows that most technological leaps forward are double-edged swords. Electronic health records increased the ability of clinicians to improve care coordination and aggregate data on population health, but they have eroded doctor-patient interactions and have become a source of physician burnout. The recent proliferation of telemedicine has expanded access to care, but it has also promoted lower-quality interactions with no physical examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of AI in health policy and research is no different. Wisely deployed, it could transform the health sector, leading to healthier populations and unfathomable breakthroughs (for example, by accelerating drug discovery). But without embedding it in new professional norms and practices, it has the potential to generate countless flawed leads and falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some potential solutions we see to the AI and health replicability crisis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clinical-specific models capable of admitting uncertainty in their outputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater transparency, requiring disclosure of AI model use in research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training for researchers, clinicians, and journalists on how to evaluate and stress-test AI-derived conclusions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-registered hypotheses and analysis plans before using AI tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI audit trails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific AI global prompts that limit sycophantic tendencies across user queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the solutions deployed, we need to solve the failure points described here to fully realize the potential of AI for use in health research. The public, AI companies, and health researchers must be active participants in this journey. After all, in science, not everyone can be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amit Chandra&lt;/strong&gt; is an emergency physician and global health policy specialist based in Washington, DC. He is an adjunct professor of global health at Georgetown University’s School of Health, where he has explored AI solutions for global health challenges since 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke Shors&lt;/strong&gt; is an entrepreneur who focuses on energy, climate, and global health. He is the co-founder of the sustainability company Capture6 and previously worked on topics including computer vision and blockchain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Editor’s note: This post is part of a blog series highlighting &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA AI Days&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; across the globe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA AI Days — hosted for and in different pockets of the world — are drawing in thousands of enthusiasts, developers, researchers and startups to discuss and explore the latest technologies making AI breakthroughs possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sydney, Australia, was the latest stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;

			Attendees check in at NVIDIA AI Day Sydney, which took place Oct. 15-16 at ICC Sydney Theatre.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, over 1,000 attendees joined NVIDIA AI Day Sydney to learn about sovereign AI — including 16 breakout sessions on agentic and physical AI, robotics and AI factories. These technologies are enabling the next frontier of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a privilege to join NVIDIA AI Day Sydney and hear how the next generation of compute is driving AI,” said Brendan Hopper, chief information officer for technology at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. “It’s phenomenal to have NVIDIA helping build out Australia’s AI ecosystem through infrastructure, partnerships and innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="alt" class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ai-day-sydney-brendan-hopper-pull-quote-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest AI trends in Australia showcase how the technology is driving digital transformation across financial services, retail and the public sector, among other industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AI Day Sydney highlighted how quantum and high-performance computing, empowered by AI, are redefining the pace and precision of scientific discovery,” said Giuseppe M. J. Barca, cofounder and head of research at QDX Technologies, and a professor at Monash University and the Australian National University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian AI ecosystem is growing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="Infographic that states there are 600+ Australia-based NVIDIA Inception startups, three Australia-based quantum computing companies working with NVIDIA, and 20+ higher-education institutions in Australia using NVIDIA technologies for research." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sydney-ecosystem-infographic-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NVIDIA AI Day Sydney was by far the best to date technology event that XENON has attended in Australia,” said Dragan Dimitrovici, founder and CEO of XENON Systems, an Australian pioneer in high-performance computing, AI and deep learning. “It brought together key NVIDIA executives, industry leaders like Canva and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, NVIDIA Inception startups, ecosystem partners, the public sector and finance organizations to talk about how AI can help make Australia into an AI nation with the advent of AI factories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Industry in Motion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA partners in Australia are advancing the nation’s role in the next industrial revolution fueled by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia-based graphic design platform provider Canva, which is working with NVIDIA to develop generative and agentic AI solutions for its hundreds of millions of users, presented on training video foundation models and curating video data at AI Day Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Canva is on a mission to empower everyone in the world to design anything and publish anywhere,” said Paul Thompson, senior director of engineering for generative AI at Canva. “We make extensive use of NVIDIA technologies to train, fine-tune and serve AI features to millions of users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;img alt="alt" class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ai-day-sydney-brendan-hopper-pull-quote-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest AI trends in Australia showcase how the technology is driving digital transformation across financial services, retail and the public sector, among other industries.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth"&gt;GM provided flights from Detroit to New York City and accommodation so Ars could attend its tech event. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Motors held a preview event today to show the world what it’s working on. We’ve already seen some projects, like the further development of lithium manganese-rich battery technology or backup power for EVs that can power a home or support the power grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant new announcement is that Cadillac will offer an Escalade IQ with a so-called “Level 3” conditional automated driving system in 2028. GM is referring to it as a “hands off, eyes off” system and says it will integrate advanced digital mapping, use of lidar and other systems, and advanced machine learning to handle the driving duties in a controlled environment up to 80 mph (129 km/h).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can theoretically watch a movie from the driver’s seat while your car takes you down the highway to the airport. Over time, the system’s operation areas will expand to cover even more roads, making driving unnecessary in many situations—unless, of course, you like to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re taking a safety-first approach,” CEO Mary Barra said to an audience of journalists at an event in New York City. “You’ll see us roll out much, much faster than what we did with Super Cruise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the system will be limited to the Escalade at first, GM has made it clear that it wants to spread the system across its lineup. Barra even had the assembled journalists imagine a world in which your car anticipates your needs, takes you where you want to go, and services itself during downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to Mercedes-Benz’s current offering, the advanced level 3 Super Cruise will work at a higher speed, and the team emphasized that the goal is for the system to work in all 50 states and in all weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I skeptical? Yes. But the company has a new liquid-cooled compute module to help handle the demands of a more advanced system. This would be the most advanced driver assistance system available to consumers in the US, and the company learned a lot through its now-shuttered Cruise autonomous vehicle program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new vehicle computer will allow GM to integrate more AI functionality into the vehicle. GM believes that incorporating Google Gemini (and eventually its own system) will help drivers better interact with a vehicle and its functions through natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;I asked Dave Richardson, GM’s SVP of software, how the company will avoid the enshittification of vehicles as it integrates more AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of hype around AI right now,” he told me. “But there’s also practical use. I’ve been trying to focus the company on practical use cases. I think there’s a lot of pretty compelling things we can do to try to add real value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave some examples, such as a car knowing you have a meeting and setting the navigation appropriately or knowing that you’re going on a road trip, so it should queue up the appropriate media for your kids to stream in the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the company is using Gemini at first, it eventually plans to have its own model on board. “With advanced processing in the car, we can handle interference on board so that it works in low-data-connection areas,” Richardson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, GM will deploy its own LLM that knows about the car and is limited in overall parameters, Richardson told me. It won’t need to rely on the cloud to operate, increasing responsiveness in the car and keeping personal information with you, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reasons to be skeptical, of course. One of my biggest concerns is how much driver data the car will collect. One reason GM doesn’t offer Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, the company has said, is that it wants to protect customer data. The owner must consent to any data sharing, GM said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although GM says it has made some internal changes to protect customer data, there have been some very public instances of the company selling data. “Data privacy and security is priority one for us,” Richardson told me about his work at GM. He said he has hired people specifically tasked with ensuring that customer data protection frameworks are in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have no interest in selling that data to third parties. When we think about data, whether it’s for Super Cruise or the AI, it’s really for us to develop the product and make it better. We don’t want to sell that data as the product itself,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there’s space for a privacy-focused automaker, and while I’m not sure whether that will be GM, I hope that privacy and data protection are as important to the company in the future as it says it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for consumers wanting AI in their vehicles? GM thinks they do.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth"&gt;GM provided flights from Detroit to New York City and accommodation so Ars could attend its tech event. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Motors held a preview event today to show the world what it’s working on. We’ve already seen some projects, like the further development of lithium manganese-rich battery technology or backup power for EVs that can power a home or support the power grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant new announcement is that Cadillac will offer an Escalade IQ with a so-called “Level 3” conditional automated driving system in 2028. GM is referring to it as a “hands off, eyes off” system and says it will integrate advanced digital mapping, use of lidar and other systems, and advanced machine learning to handle the driving duties in a controlled environment up to 80 mph (129 km/h).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can theoretically watch a movie from the driver’s seat while your car takes you down the highway to the airport. Over time, the system’s operation areas will expand to cover even more roads, making driving unnecessary in many situations—unless, of course, you like to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re taking a safety-first approach,” CEO Mary Barra said to an audience of journalists at an event in New York City. “You’ll see us roll out much, much faster than what we did with Super Cruise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the system will be limited to the Escalade at first, GM has made it clear that it wants to spread the system across its lineup. Barra even had the assembled journalists imagine a world in which your car anticipates your needs, takes you where you want to go, and services itself during downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to Mercedes-Benz’s current offering, the advanced level 3 Super Cruise will work at a higher speed, and the team emphasized that the goal is for the system to work in all 50 states and in all weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I skeptical? Yes. But the company has a new liquid-cooled compute module to help handle the demands of a more advanced system. This would be the most advanced driver assistance system available to consumers in the US, and the company learned a lot through its now-shuttered Cruise autonomous vehicle program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new vehicle computer will allow GM to integrate more AI functionality into the vehicle. GM believes that incorporating Google Gemini (and eventually its own system) will help drivers better interact with a vehicle and its functions through natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Dave Richardson, GM’s SVP of software, how the company will avoid the enshittification of vehicles as it integrates more AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of hype around AI right now,” he told me. “But there’s also practical use. I’ve been trying to focus the company on practical use cases. I think there’s a lot of pretty compelling things we can do to try to add real value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave some examples, such as a car knowing you have a meeting and setting the navigation appropriately or knowing that you’re going on a road trip, so it should queue up the appropriate media for your kids to stream in the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the company is using Gemini at first, it eventually plans to have its own model on board. “With advanced processing in the car, we can handle interference on board so that it works in low-data-connection areas,” Richardson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, GM will deploy its own LLM that knows about the car and is limited in overall parameters, Richardson told me. It won’t need to rely on the cloud to operate, increasing responsiveness in the car and keeping personal information with you, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reasons to be skeptical, of course. One of my biggest concerns is how much driver data the car will collect. One reason GM doesn’t offer Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, the company has said, is that it wants to protect customer data. The owner must consent to any data sharing, GM said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although GM says it has made some internal changes to protect customer data, there have been some very public instances of the company selling data. “Data privacy and security is priority one for us,” Richardson told me about his work at GM. He said he has hired people specifically tasked with ensuring that customer data protection frameworks are in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have no interest in selling that data to third parties. When we think about data, whether it’s for Super Cruise or the AI, it’s really for us to develop the product and make it better. We don’t want to sell that data as the product itself,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there’s space for a privacy-focused automaker, and while I’m not sure whether that will be GM, I hope that privacy and data protection are as important to the company in the future as it says it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for consumers wanting AI in their vehicles? GM thinks they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also requested “all documents relating to memorial services or events in the honor of the decedent, including but not limited to any videos or photographs taken, or eulogies given,” per a document obtained by the Financial Times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Speaking to the FT, lawyers from the Raine family described the request as “intentional harassment.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new information comes as the Raine family updated its lawsuit against OpenAI on Wednesday. The family first filed a wrongful death suit against OpenAI in August after alleging their son had taken his own life following conversations with the chatbot about his mental health and suicidal ideation.&amp;nbsp;The updated lawsuit claims that OpenAI rushed GPT-4o’s May 2024 release by cutting safety testing due to competitive pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The suit also claims that in February 2025, OpenAI weakened protections by removing suicide prevention from its “disallowed content” list, instead only advising the AI to “take care in risky situations.” The family argued that after this change, Adam’s ChatGPT usage surged from dozens of daily chats, with 1.6% containing self-harm content in January, to 300 daily chats in April, the month he died, with 17% containing such content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a response to the amended lawsuit, OpenAI said: “Teen wellbeing is a top priority for us — minors deserve strong protections, especially in sensitive moments. We have safeguards in place today, such as [directing to] crisis hotlines, rerouting sensitive conversations to safer models, nudging for breaks during long sessions, and we’re continuing to strengthen them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI recently began rolling out a new safety routing system and parental controls on ChatGPT. The routing system pushes more emotionally sensitive conversations to OpenAI’s newer model, GPT-5, which doesn’t have the same sycophantic tendencies as GPT-4o. And the parental controls allow parents to receive safety alerts in limited situations where the teen is potentially in danger of self-harm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The effort is driven by a deep belief in “scaling” — the idea that adding more computing power to existing AI training methods will eventually yield superintelligent systems capable of performing all kinds of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But a growing chorus of AI researchers say the scaling of large language models may be reaching its limits, and that other breakthroughs may be needed to improve AI performance.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s the bet Sara Hooker, Cohere’s former VP of AI Research and a Google Brain alumna, is taking with her new startup, Adaption Labs. She co-founded the company with fellow Cohere and Google veteran Sudip Roy, and it’s built on the idea that scaling LLMs has become an inefficient way to squeeze more performance out of AI models. Hooker, who left Cohere in August, quietly announced the startup this month to start recruiting more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;I'm starting a new project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working on what I consider to be the most important problem: building thinking machines that adapt and continuously learn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have incredibly talent dense founding team + are hiring for engineering, ops, design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us: https://t.co/eKlfWAfuRy&lt;/p&gt;— Sara Hooker (@sarahookr) October 7, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an interview with TechCrunch, Hooker says Adaption Labs is building AI systems that can continuously adapt and learn from their real-world experiences, and do so extremely efficiently. She declined to share details about the methods behind this approach or whether the company relies on LLMs or another architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There is a turning point now where it’s very clear that the formula of just scaling these models — scaling-pilled approaches, which are attractive but extremely boring — hasn’t produced intelligence that is able to navigate or interact with the world,” said Hooker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adapting is the “heart of learning,” according to Hooker. For example, stub your toe when you walk past your dining room table, and you’ll learn to step more carefully around it next time. AI labs have tried to capture this idea through reinforcement learning (RL), which allows AI models to learn from their mistakes in controlled settings. However, today’s RL methods don’t help AI models in production — meaning systems already being used by customers — to learn from their mistakes in real time. They just keep stubbing their toe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some AI labs offer consulting services to help enterprises fine-tune their AI models to their custom needs, but it comes at a price. OpenAI reportedly requires customers to spend upward of $10 million with the company to offer its consulting services on fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have a handful of frontier labs that determine this set of AI models that are served the same way to everyone, and they’re very expensive to adapt,” said Hooker. “And actually, I think that doesn’t need to be true anymore, and AI systems can very efficiently learn from an environment. Proving that will completely change the dynamics of who gets to control and shape AI, and really, who these models serve at the end of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adaption Labs is the latest sign that the industry’s faith in scaling LLMs is wavering. A recent paper from MIT researchers found that the world’s largest AI models may soon show diminishing returns. The vibes in San Francisco seem to be shifting, too. The AI world’s favorite podcaster, Dwarkesh Patel, recently hosted some unusually skeptical conversations with famous AI researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Richard Sutton, a Turing award winner regarded as “the father of RL,” told Patel in September that LLMs can’t truly scale because they don’t learn from real-world experience. This month, early OpenAI employee Andrej Karpathy told Patel he had reservations about the long-term potential of RL to improve AI models.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These types of fears aren’t unprecedented. In late 2024, some AI researchers raised concerns that scaling AI models through pretraining — in which AI models learn patterns from heaps of datasets — was hitting diminishing returns. Until then, pretraining had been the secret sauce for OpenAI and Google to improve their models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those pretraining scaling concerns are now showing up in the data, but the AI industry has found other ways to improve models. In 2025, breakthroughs around AI reasoning models, which take additional time and computational resources to work through problems before answering, have pushed the capabilities of AI models even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI labs seem convinced that scaling up RL and AI reasoning models are the new frontier. OpenAI researchers previously told TechCrunch that they developed their first AI reasoning model, o1, because they thought it would scale up well. Meta and Periodic Labs researchers recently released a paper exploring how RL could scale performance further — a study that reportedly cost more than $4 million, underscoring how expensive current approaches remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adaption Labs, by contrast, aims to find the next breakthrough and prove that learning from experience can be far cheaper. The startup was in talks to raise a $20 million to $40 million seed round earlier this fall, according to three investors who reviewed its pitch decks. They say the round has since closed, though the final amount is unclear. Hooker declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re set up to be very ambitious,” said Hooker, when asked about her investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hooker previously led Cohere Labs, where she trained small AI models for enterprise use cases. Compact AI systems now routinely outperform their larger counterparts on coding, math, and reasoning benchmarks — a trend Hooker wants to continue pushing on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She also built a reputation for broadening access to AI research globally, hiring research talent from underrepresented regions such as Africa. While Adaption Labs will open a San Francisco office soon, Hooker says she plans to hire worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Hooker and Adaption Labs are right about the limitations of scaling, the implications could be huge. Billions have already been invested in scaling LLMs, with the assumption that bigger models will lead to general intelligence. But it’s possible that true adaptive learning could prove not only more powerful — but far more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

Hooker, who left Cohere in August, quietly announced the startup this month to start recruiting more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;I'm starting a new project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working on what I consider to be the most important problem: building thinking machines that adapt and continuously learn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have incredibly talent dense founding team + are hiring for engineering, ops, design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us: https://t.co/eKlfWAfuRy&lt;/p&gt;— Sara Hooker (@sarahookr) October 7, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an interview with TechCrunch, Hooker says Adaption Labs is building AI systems that can continuously adapt and learn from their real-world experiences, and do so extremely efficiently. She declined to share details about the methods behind this approach or whether the company relies on LLMs or another architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There is a turning point now where it’s very clear that the formula of just scaling these models — scaling-pilled approaches, which are attractive but extremely boring — hasn’t produced intelligence that is able to navigate or interact with the world,” said Hooker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adapting is the “heart of learning,” according to Hooker. For example, stub your toe when you walk past your dining room table, and you’ll learn to step more carefully around it next time. AI labs have tried to capture this idea through reinforcement learning (RL), which allows AI models to learn from their mistakes in controlled settings. However, today’s RL methods don’t help AI models in production — meaning systems already being used by customers — to learn from their mistakes in real time. They just keep stubbing their toe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some AI labs offer consulting services to help enterprises fine-tune their AI models to their custom needs, but it comes at a price. OpenAI reportedly requires customers to spend upward of $10 million with the company to offer its consulting services on fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have a handful of frontier labs that determine this set of AI models that are served the same way to everyone, and they’re very expensive to adapt,” said Hooker. “And actually, I think that doesn’t need to be true anymore, and AI systems can very efficiently learn from an environment. Proving that will completely change the dynamics of who gets to control and shape AI, and really, who these models serve at the end of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adaption Labs is the latest sign that the industry’s faith in scaling LLMs is wavering. A recent paper from MIT researchers found that the world’s largest AI models may soon show diminishing returns. The vibes in San Francisco seem to be shifting, too. The AI world’s favorite podcaster, Dwarkesh Patel, recently hosted some unusually skeptical conversations with famous AI researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Richard Sutton, a Turing award winner regarded as “the father of RL,” told Patel in September that LLMs can’t truly scale because they don’t learn from real-world experience. This month, early OpenAI employee Andrej Karpathy told Patel he had reservations about the long-term potential of RL to improve AI models.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These types of fears aren’t unprecedented. In late 2024, some AI researchers raised concerns that scaling AI models through pretraining — in which AI models learn patterns from heaps of datasets — was hitting diminishing returns. Until then, pretraining had been the secret sauce for OpenAI and Google to improve their models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those pretraining scaling concerns are now showing up in the data, but the AI industry has found other ways to improve models. In 2025, breakthroughs around AI reasoning models, which take additional time and computational resources to work through problems before answering, have pushed the capabilities of AI models even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI labs seem convinced that scaling up RL and AI reasoning models are the new frontier. OpenAI researchers previously told TechCrunch that they developed their first AI reasoning model, o1, because they thought it would scale up well. Meta and Periodic Labs researchers recently released a paper exploring how RL could scale performance further — a study that reportedly cost more than $4 million, underscoring how expensive current approaches remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adaption Labs, by contrast, aims to find the next breakthrough and prove that learning from experience can be far cheaper. The startup was in talks to raise a $20 million to $40 million seed round earlier this fall, according to three investors who reviewed its pitch decks. They say the round has since closed, though the final amount is unclear. Hooker declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re set up to be very ambitious,” said Hooker, when asked about her investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hooker previously led Cohere Labs, where she trained small AI models for enterprise use cases. Compact AI systems now routinely outperform their larger counterparts on coding, math, and reasoning benchmarks — a trend Hooker wants to continue pushing on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She also built a reputation for broadening access to AI research globally, hiring research talent from underrepresented regions such as Africa. While Adaption Labs will open a San Francisco office soon, Hooker says she plans to hire worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Hooker and Adaption Labs are right about the limitations of scaling, the implications could be huge. Billions have already been invested in scaling LLMs, with the assumption that bigger models will lead to general intelligence. But it’s possible that true adaptive learning could prove not only more powerful — but far more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

The Lens was initially launched in September but only for paid subscribers. With the Lens, users can edit their own Snaps using custom prompts or generate their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For instance, you could prompt the app, “Turn me into an alien” after snapping a selfie, or request an image of a “grumpy cat.” The company suggests you could use the Lens to try on Halloween costume ideas, or reimagine your friend in a new look, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The results can be shared with friends, posted to your Story on Snapchat, or shared beyond the app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The broadened availability of the AI Lens follows the launch of AI video-generating apps from Meta (Meta AI) and OpenAI (Sora), which compete for young people’s attention with even more advanced AI tools and features than photo modifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For instance, Sora lets users generate videos of themselves after providing the app with a one-time video and audio recording to capture their appearance. Friends can share these AI personas, dubbed “cameos,” with one another, so they can star in videos together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That puts pressure on other social apps like Snapchat to keep up, so making the AI image Lens free to use seems a worthwhile investment for the app maker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Until now, Snapchat’s AI Lens was only available to Lens+ and Snapchat Platinum Subscribers, the company says. With the expanded rollout, Snap is making a limited number of image generations available to all free users, as well. At launch, free users in the U.S. will be able to access the new Lens, with plans for other markets underway, starting with Canada, Great Britain, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

The letter is a strategic signal to enterprise engineering leaders: CIOs, CTOs, AI leads, platform architects and security directors. Nadella outlines the direction of Microsoft’s innovation, but also what it expects from its customers and partners. The AI era is here, but it will be built by those who combine technical vision with operational discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are the five most important takeaways for enterprise technical decision makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Security and reliability are now the foundation of the AI stack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella makes security the first priority in the letter and ties it directly to Microsoft’s relevance going forward. Through its Secure Future Initiative (SFI), Microsoft has assigned the equivalent of 34,000 engineers to secure its identity systems, networks and software supply chain. Its Quality Excellence Initiative (QEI) aims to increase platform resiliency and strengthen global service uptime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s positioning makes it clear that enterprises will no longer get away with “ship fast, harden later” AI deployments. Nadella calls security “non-negotiable,” signaling that AI infrastructure must now meet the standards of mission-critical software. That means identity-first architecture, zero-trust execution environments and change management discipline are now table stakes for enterprise AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. AI infrastructure strategy is hybrid, open and sovereignty-ready&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella commits Microsoft to building “planet-scale systems” and backs that up with numbers: more than 400 Azure datacenters across 70 regions, two gigawatts of new compute capacity added this year, and new liquid-cooled GPU clusters rolling out across Azure. Microsoft also introduced Fairwater, a massive new AI datacenter in Wisconsin positioned to deliver unprecedented scale. Just as important, Microsoft is now officially multi-model. Azure AI Foundry offers access to more than 11,000 models including OpenAI, Meta, Mistral, Cohere and xAI. Microsoft is no longer pushing a single-model future, but a hybrid AI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises should interpret this as validation of “portfolio architectures,” where closed, open and domain-specific models coexist. Nadella also emphasizes growing investment in sovereign cloud offerings for regulated industries, previewing a world where AI systems will have to meet regional data residency and compliance requirements from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. AI agents—not just chatbots—are now Microsoft’s future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI shift inside Microsoft is no longer about copilots that answer questions. It is now about AI agents that perform work. Nadella points to the rollout of Agent Mode in Microsoft 365 Copilot, which turns natural language requests into multistep business workflows. GitHub Copilot evolves from code autocomplete into a “peer programmer” capable of executing tasks asynchronously. In security operations, Microsoft has deployed AI agents that autonomously respond to incidents. In healthcare, Copilot for Dragon Medical documents clinical encounters automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a major architectural pivot. Enterprises will need to move beyond prompt-response interfaces and begin engineering agent ecosystems that safely take actions inside business systems. That requires workflow orchestration, API integration strategies and strong guardrails. Nadella’s letter frames this as the next software platform shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Unified data platforms are required to unlock AI value&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella devotes significant attention to &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/enterprise-ai-success-is-about-more-than-just-data-its-about-knowledge-heres"&gt;Microsoft Fabric&lt;/a&gt; and OneLake, calling Fabric the company’s fastest-growing data and analytics product ever. Fabric promises to centralize enterprise data from multiple cloud and analytics environments. OneLake provides a universal storage layer that binds analytics and AI workloads together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s message is blunt: siloed data means stalled AI. Enterprise teams that want AI at scale must unify operational and analytical data into a single architecture, enforce consistent data contracts and standardize metadata governance. AI success is now a data engineering problem more than a model problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Trust, compliance and responsible AI are now mandatory for deployment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People want technology they can trust,” Nadella writes. Microsoft now publishes Responsible AI Transparency Reports and aligns parts of its development process with UN human rights guidance. Microsoft is also committing to digital resilience in Europe and proactive safeguards against misuse of AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shifts responsible AI out of the realm of corporate messaging and into engineering practice. Enterprises will need model documentation, reproducibility practices, audit trails, risk monitoring and human-in-the-loop checkpoints. Nadella signals that compliance will become integrated with product delivery—not an afterthought layered on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The real meaning of Microsoft’s AI strategy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these five pillars send a clear message to enterprise leaders: AI maturity is no longer about building prototypes or proving use cases. System-level readiness now defines success. Nadella frames Microsoft’s mission as helping customers “think in decades and execute in quarters,” and that is more than corporate poetry. It is a call to build AI platforms engineered for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies that win in enterprise AI will be the ones that invest early in secure cloud foundations, unify their data architectures, enable agent-based workflows and embrace responsible AI as a prerequisite for scale—not a press release.
