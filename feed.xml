          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last week, The Hollywood Reporter ran a story about an "AI Stan Lee hologram" that would be appearing at the LA Comic Con this weekend. Nearly seven years after the famous Marvel Comics creator’s death at the age of 95, fans will be able to pay $15 to $20 this weekend to chat with a life-sized, AI-powered avatar of Lee in an enclosed booth at the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instant response from many fans and media outlets to the idea was not kind, to say the least. A writer for TheGamer called the very idea "demonic" and said we need to "kill it with fire before it’s too late." The AV Club urged its readers not to pay to see "the anguished digital ghost of a beloved comic book creator, repurposed as a trap for chumps!" Reactions on a popular Reddit thread ranged from calling it "incredibly disrespectful" and "in bad taste" to "ghoulish" and "so fucked up," with very little that was more receptive to the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Chris DeMoulin, the CEO of the parent company behind LA Comic Con, urged critics to come see the AI-powered hologram for themselves before rushing to judgment. "We're not afraid of people seeing it and we're not afraid of criticism," he told Ars. "I’m just a fan of informed criticism, and I think most of what's been out there so far has not really been informed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's unfortunate that a few people have really negative things to say about it, sight unseen, just the level of it being a concept," DeMoulin continued. "It's not perfect. I'm not sure something like this can ever be perfect. But I think what you strive to do is feed enough information into it and test it enough so that the experience it creates for the fans is one that feels genuine."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;“It’s going to have to be really good or we’re all going to say no”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time LA Comic Con has featured an interactive hologram (which for the Stan Lee experience means a life-sized volumetric screen-in-a-box that can show different views from different angles). Starting in 2019, the convention used similar technology to feature Boffo the Bear, a 7-foot-tall animated blue ursid who served as the MC for a live talent show featuring famous voice acting talent. But Boffo was powered by a real-time motion-captured improv performance from actor Mark DeCarlo rather than automated artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      A live mo-capped version of Boffo the Bear hosts a panel with voice actors at LA Comic Con.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years since Boffo’s introduction at the con, DeMoulin said he’s kept up with the team behind that hologram and "saw the leaps and bounds that they were making in improving the technology, improving the interactivity." Now, he said, it’s possible to create an AI-powered version that ingests "all of the actual comments that people made during their life" to craft an interactive hologram that "is not literally quoting the person, but everything it was saying was based on things that person actually said."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeMoulin said he called Bob Sabouni, who manages the Stan Lee Legacy brand, to pitch the AI Stan Lee avatar as "kind of an entry point into people asking questions about the Marvel universe, the stories, the characters he created." Sabouni agreed to the idea, DeMoulin said, but added that "it's gonna have to be really good or we're all going to say no."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that somewhat conditional approval, DeMoulin reached out to Proto Hologram, the company that had developed the Boffo the Bear experience years earlier. Proto, in turn, reached out to Hyperreal, a company that describes itself as "powering ownership, control, performance, and monetization of identity across digital ecosystems" to help develop the AI model that would power the Lee avatar.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      A promotional video from Proto Holograms shows off the kind of volumetric box that the AI-powered Stan Lee avatar will appear in.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperreal CEO and Chief Architect Remington Scott tells Ars that the company "leverages a customized ecosystem of cutting-edge AI technologies" to create "bespoke" and "custom-crafted" AI versions of celebrities. To do that for Stan Lee, DeMoulin said they trained a model on decades of content he had left behind, from tapes of dozens of convention panels he had appeared on to written and spoken content gathered by the managers of the Stan Lee Universe brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott said Hyperreal "can't share specific technical details" of the models or training techniques they use to power these recreations. But Scott added that this training project is "particularly meaningful, [because] Stan Lee had actually begun digitizing himself while he was alive, with the vision of creating a digital double so his fans could interact with him on a larger scale."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After incurring costs of "tens of thousands into six figures" of dollars, DeMoulin said he was finally able to test the Lee hologram about a month ago. That first version still needed some tweaks to get the look and feel of Lee’s delivery just right, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Stan had a considered way of speaking… he would pause, he had certain catch phrases that when he used them he would say them in a certain way," DeMoulin said. "So it took a while to get to the hologram to be able to say all that in a way that [Sabouni] and I and others that work with Stan felt like, ‘Yeah, that’s actually starting to sound more like him.’"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“The only words that are gonna be in Stan’s mouth are Stan’s words”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is familiar with LLMs and their tendency to confabulate might be worried about the potential for an AI Lee avatar to go off-script or make things up in front of a live audience. And while DeMoulin said he was concerned about that going in, those concerns have faded as he and others who worked with Lee in his lifetime have spent hours throwing "hundreds and hundreds and hundreds" of questions at the hologram "to sort of see where the sensitivities on it are."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;"The only words that are gonna be in Stan's mouth are Stan's words," DeMoulin said. "Just because I haven't personally seen [the model hallucinate] doesn't mean that it's impossible, but that hasn't been my experience."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      The living version of Stan Lee appeared at the Wizard World convention in 2018, shortly before his death.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a moderator at the convention will be on hand to repeat fan questions into a microphone (to avoid ambient crowd noise from the showfloor), DeMoulin said there won’t be any human filtering on what fans are allowed to ask the Lee avatar in the 15- to 20-minute group Q&amp;amp;A sessions. Instead, DeMoulin said the team has set up a system of "content governors" so that, for instance, "if you ask Stan what he thought of the last presidential election he's gonna say 'That's not what we're here to talk about. We're here to talk about the Marvel universe.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For topics that are Marvel-related, though, the AI avatar won’t shy away from controversy, DeMoulin said. If you ask the avatar about Jack Kirby, for instance, DeMoulin said it will address the "honest disagreements about characters or storylines, which are gonna happen in any creative enterprise," while also saying that "‘I have nothing but respect for him,’ which is I think largely what Stan would have said if he was asked that question."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperreal’s Scott said the company's approach to training digital avatars on verified content "ensures responses stay true to Stan's documented perspectives and values." And DeMoulin said the model is perfectly willing to say when it doesn’t know the answer to an appropriate question. In early testing, for instance, the avatar couldn’t answer a question about the Merry Marvel Marching Society, DeMoulin said, because that wasn’t part of its training data. After a subsequent update, the new model provided a relevant answer to the same question, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;“We are not trying to bring Stan back from the dead”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout our talk, DeMoulin repeatedly stressed that their AI hologram wasn’t intended to serve as a replacement for the living version of Lee. "We want to make sure that people understand that we are not trying to bring Stan back from the dead," he said. "We're not trying to say that this is Stan, and we're not trying to put words in his mouth, and this avatar is not gonna start doing commercials to advertise other people's products."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeMoulin said he sees the Lee avatar as a kind of futuristic guide to a library of Marvel information and trivia, presented with a fun and familiar face. "In the introduction, the avatar will say, ‘I'm here as a result of the latest developments in technology, which allow me to be a holographic representation of Stan to answer your questions about Marvel and trivia’ and this, that, and the other thing," DeMoulin said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, DeMoulin said he understands why the idea of using even a stylized version of Lee’s likeness in this manner could rub some fans the wrong way. "When a new technology comes out, it just feels wrong to them, and I respect the fact that this feels wrong to people," he said. "I totally agree that something like this–not just for Stan but for anyone, any celebrity alive or dead–could be put into this technology and used in a way that would be exploitative and unfortunate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2119425 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;
          &lt;div class="ars-lightbox-item"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Fans like these, seen at LA Comic Con 2022, will be the final arbiters of whether the AI-powered Stan Lee avatar is respectful or not.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why DeMoulin said he and the others behind the AI-powered Lee feel a responsibility "to make sure that if we were going to do this, we never got anywhere close to that." Moreover, he said he's "&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;disappointed that people would be so negative about something they've not seen.&lt;/span&gt; … It's not that I think that their point of view is invalid. What I think is invalid is having a wildly negative point of view about something that you haven't actually seen."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott said concerns about respect for the actual human celebrity are why they "partner exclusively with authorized estates and rights holders like Stan Lee Universe." The "premium, authenticated digital identities" created by Hyperreal’s system are "not replacing artists" but "creating respectful digital extensions that honor their legacy," Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once fans actually see the AI-powered Lee avatar in person, DeMoulin said he’s confident they’ll see the team behind the convention is "trying to do it in a way that will actually be delightful and very much be consistent with Stan's legacy… We clearly have to set our sights on doing this right, and doing it right means getting people that knew and loved the guy and worked with him during his career to give us input, and then putting it in front of enough fans to know if we're doing it in a way that lives up to his standards."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if he’s wrong about the expected reception? "I suppose if we do it and thousands of fans interact with [it] and they don't like it, we'll stop doing it," he said. "I saw firsthand the impact that Stan had in that [convention] environment, so I think we have a team of people together that love and respect that and are trying to do something which will continue that. And if it turns out, for some reason, this isn't that, we won't do it."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last week, The Hollywood Reporter ran a story about an "AI Stan Lee hologram" that would be appearing at the LA Comic Con this weekend. Nearly seven years after the famous Marvel Comics creator’s death at the age of 95, fans will be able to pay $15 to $20 this weekend to chat with a life-sized, AI-powered avatar of Lee in an enclosed booth at the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instant response from many fans and media outlets to the idea was not kind, to say the least. A writer for TheGamer called the very idea "demonic" and said we need to "kill it with fire before it’s too late." The AV Club urged its readers not to pay to see "the anguished digital ghost of a beloved comic book creator, repurposed as a trap for chumps!" Reactions on a popular Reddit thread ranged from calling it "incredibly disrespectful" and "in bad taste" to "ghoulish" and "so fucked up," with very little that was more receptive to the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Chris DeMoulin, the CEO of the parent company behind LA Comic Con, urged critics to come see the AI-powered hologram for themselves before rushing to judgment. "We're not afraid of people seeing it and we're not afraid of criticism," he told Ars. "I’m just a fan of informed criticism, and I think most of what's been out there so far has not really been informed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's unfortunate that a few people have really negative things to say about it, sight unseen, just the level of it being a concept," DeMoulin continued. "It's not perfect. I'm not sure something like this can ever be perfect. But I think what you strive to do is feed enough information into it and test it enough so that the experience it creates for the fans is one that feels genuine."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;“It’s going to have to be really good or we’re all going to say no”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time LA Comic Con has featured an interactive hologram (which for the Stan Lee experience means a life-sized volumetric screen-in-a-box that can show different views from different angles). Starting in 2019, the convention used similar technology to feature Boffo the Bear, a 7-foot-tall animated blue ursid who served as the MC for a live talent show featuring famous voice acting talent. But Boffo was powered by a real-time motion-captured improv performance from actor Mark DeCarlo rather than automated artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      A live mo-capped version of Boffo the Bear hosts a panel with voice actors at LA Comic Con.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years since Boffo’s introduction at the con, DeMoulin said he’s kept up with the team behind that hologram and "saw the leaps and bounds that they were making in improving the technology, improving the interactivity." Now, he said, it’s possible to create an AI-powered version that ingests "all of the actual comments that people made during their life" to craft an interactive hologram that "is not literally quoting the person, but everything it was saying was based on things that person actually said."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeMoulin said he called Bob Sabouni, who manages the Stan Lee Legacy brand, to pitch the AI Stan Lee avatar as "kind of an entry point into people asking questions about the Marvel universe, the stories, the characters he created." Sabouni agreed to the idea, DeMoulin said, but added that "it's gonna have to be really good or we're all going to say no."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that somewhat conditional approval, DeMoulin reached out to Proto Hologram, the company that had developed the Boffo the Bear experience years earlier. Proto, in turn, reached out to Hyperreal, a company that describes itself as "powering ownership, control, performance, and monetization of identity across digital ecosystems" to help develop the AI model that would power the Lee avatar.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperreal CEO and Chief Architect Remington Scott tells Ars that the company "leverages a customized ecosystem of cutting-edge AI technologies" to create "bespoke" and "custom-crafted" AI versions of celebrities. To do that for Stan Lee, DeMoulin said they trained a model on decades of content he had left behind, from tapes of dozens of convention panels he had appeared on to written and spoken content gathered by the managers of the Stan Lee Universe brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott said Hyperreal "can't share specific technical details" of the models or training techniques they use to power these recreations. But Scott added that this training project is "particularly meaningful, [because] Stan Lee had actually begun digitizing himself while he was alive, with the vision of creating a digital double so his fans could interact with him on a larger scale."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After incurring costs of "tens of thousands into six figures" of dollars, DeMoulin said he was finally able to test the Lee hologram about a month ago. That first version still needed some tweaks to get the look and feel of Lee’s delivery just right, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Stan had a considered way of speaking… he would pause, he had certain catch phrases that when he used them he would say them in a certain way," DeMoulin said. "So it took a while to get to the hologram to be able to say all that in a way that [Sabouni] and I and others that work with Stan felt like, ‘Yeah, that’s actually starting to sound more like him.’"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“The only words that are gonna be in Stan’s mouth are Stan’s words”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is familiar with LLMs and their tendency to confabulate might be worried about the potential for an AI Lee avatar to go off-script or make things up in front of a live audience. And while DeMoulin said he was concerned about that going in, those concerns have faded as he and others who worked with Lee in his lifetime have spent hours throwing "hundreds and hundreds and hundreds" of questions at the hologram "to sort of see where the sensitivities on it are."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The only words that are gonna be in Stan's mouth are Stan's words," DeMoulin said. "Just because I haven't personally seen [the model hallucinate] doesn't mean that it's impossible, but that hasn't been my experience."&lt;/p&gt;

      The living version of Stan Lee appeared at the Wizard World convention in 2018, shortly before his death.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a moderator at the convention will be on hand to repeat fan questions into a microphone (to avoid ambient crowd noise from the showfloor), DeMoulin said there won’t be any human filtering on what fans are allowed to ask the Lee avatar in the 15- to 20-minute group Q&amp;amp;A sessions. Instead, DeMoulin said the team has set up a system of "content governors" so that, for instance, "if you ask Stan what he thought of the last presidential election he's gonna say 'That's not what we're here to talk about. We're here to talk about the Marvel universe.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For topics that are Marvel-related, though, the AI avatar won’t shy away from controversy, DeMoulin said. If you ask the avatar about Jack Kirby, for instance, DeMoulin said it will address the "honest disagreements about characters or storylines, which are gonna happen in any creative enterprise," while also saying that "‘I have nothing but respect for him,’ which is I think largely what Stan would have said if he was asked that question."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperreal’s Scott said the company's approach to training digital avatars on verified content "ensures responses stay true to Stan's documented perspectives and values." And DeMoulin said the model is perfectly willing to say when it doesn’t know the answer to an appropriate question. In early testing, for instance, the avatar couldn’t answer a question about the Merry Marvel Marching Society, DeMoulin said, because that wasn’t part of its training data. After a subsequent update, the new model provided a relevant answer to the same question, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;“We are not trying to bring Stan back from the dead”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout our talk, DeMoulin repeatedly stressed that their AI hologram wasn’t intended to serve as a replacement for the living version of Lee. "We want to make sure that people understand that we are not trying to bring Stan back from the dead," he said. "We're not trying to say that this is Stan, and we're not trying to put words in his mouth, and this avatar is not gonna start doing commercials to advertise other people's products."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeMoulin said he sees the Lee avatar as a kind of futuristic guide to a library of Marvel information and trivia, presented with a fun and familiar face. "In the introduction, the avatar will say, ‘I'm here as a result of the latest developments in technology, which allow me to be a holographic representation of Stan to answer your questions about Marvel and trivia’ and this, that, and the other thing," DeMoulin said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, DeMoulin said he understands why the idea of using even a stylized version of Lee’s likeness in this manner could rub some fans the wrong way. "When a new technology comes out, it just feels wrong to them, and I respect the fact that this feels wrong to people," he said. "I totally agree that something like this–not just for Stan but for anyone, any celebrity alive or dead–could be put into this technology and used in a way that would be exploitative and unfortunate."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Fans like these, seen at LA Comic Con 2022, will be the final arbiters of whether the AI-powered Stan Lee avatar is respectful or not.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why DeMoulin said he and the others behind the AI-powered Lee feel a responsibility "to make sure that if we were going to do this, we never got anywhere close to that." Moreover, he said he's "&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;disappointed that people would be so negative about something they've not seen.&lt;/span&gt; … It's not that I think that their point of view is invalid. What I think is invalid is having a wildly negative point of view about something that you haven't actually seen."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott said concerns about respect for the actual human celebrity are why they "partner exclusively with authorized estates and rights holders like Stan Lee Universe." The "premium, authenticated digital identities" created by Hyperreal’s system are "not replacing artists" but "creating respectful digital extensions that honor their legacy," Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once fans actually see the AI-powered Lee avatar in person, DeMoulin said he’s confident they’ll see the team behind the convention is "trying to do it in a way that will actually be delightful and very much be consistent with Stan's legacy… We clearly have to set our sights on doing this right, and doing it right means getting people that knew and loved the guy and worked with him during his career to give us input, and then putting it in front of enough fans to know if we're doing it in a way that lives up to his standards."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if he’s wrong about the expected reception? "I suppose if we do it and thousands of fans interact with [it] and they don't like it, we'll stop doing it," he said. "I saw firsthand the impact that Stan had in that [convention] environment, so I think we have a team of people together that love and respect that and are trying to do something which will continue that. And if it turns out, for some reason, this isn't that, we won't do it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last month, the nation launched its most ambitious sovereign AI initiative to date, pledging ₩530 billion, (about $390 million), to five local companies building large-scale foundational models.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move underscores Seoul’s desire to cut reliance on foreign AI technologies, hoping to strengthen national security and keep a tighter control over data in the AI era.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The organizations picked by the Ministry of Science and ICT to compete were LG AI Research, SK Telecom, Naver Cloud, NC AI, and the startup Upstage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Every six months, the government will review the first cohort’s progress, cut underperformers, and continue funding the frontrunners until just two remain to lead the country’s sovereign AI drive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Each player is bringing a different advantage to South Korea’s AI race. TechCrunch spoke with several of the selected companies about how they plan to take on OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and the rest on their home turf.&amp;nbsp;NC AI declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lg-ai-research-exaone"&gt;LG AI Research: Exaone&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LG AI Research, the R&amp;amp;D unit of South Korean giant LG Group, offers Exaone 4.0, a hybrid reasoning AI model. The latest version blends broad language processing with the advanced reasoning features first introduced in the company’s earlier Exaone Deep model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Exaone 4.0 (32B) already scores reasonably well against competitors on Artificial Analysis’s Intelligence Index benchmark (as does Upstage’s Solar Pro2). But it plans to improve and move up the ranks through its deep access to real-world industry data ranging from biotech to advanced materials and manufacturing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s coupling that data with a focus on refining the data before feeding to the models to train. Instead of chasing sheer scale, LG wants to make the entire process more intelligent, so its AI can deliver real, practical value that goes beyond what general-purpose models can offer. “This is our fundamental approach,” co-head Honglak Lee told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LG is improving its models via familiar tactics: offering them through APIs, then using the real-world data generated by users of those services to train the model to improve.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As LG’s models improve, our partners can deliver better services, which in turn generate greater economic value and even richer data,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, instead of chasing massive GPU clusters, LG AI Research is focusing on efficiency, getting the most out of every chip, and creating industry-specific models, he mentioned. The goal isn’t to outspend the global giants but to outsmart them with high-performing, yet more efficient, AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;South Korea’s telco giant SK Telecom (SKT) launched its personal AI agent A. (pronounced A-dot) service way back in late 2023 and just rolled out its new large language model, A.X, this July.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Built on top of the Chinese open source model from Alibaba Cloud, Qwen 2.5, A.X 4.0 comes in two models, a hefty 72-billion-parameter version and a lighter 7B version.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SK says that A.X 4.0 processes Korean inputs about 33% more efficiently than GPT-4o did, underscoring its local language edge. (OpenAI’s GPT 5.0 comparison data is not available.) SKT also open sourced its A.X 3.1 models earlier this summer. Meanwhile, the A. service offers features like AI call summaries and auto-generated notes. As of August 2025, it’s already pulled in about 10 million subscribers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SK’s edge is its versatility, because it has access to information from its telecom network ranging from navigation to taxi-hailing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“SK Telecom’s role is to act as a bridge between cutting-edge model research and real-world impact. With our telecom infrastructure, extensive user base and proven service like A., we bring AI directly into everyday life, whether in customer service, mobility, or manufacturing,” Taeyoon Kim, head of the foundation model office at SK Telecom, told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SK Telecom is also investing in AI infrastructure, using GPUaaS, South Korea’s largest GPU-based service, and building a new hyperscale AI data center with AWS. Whatever it lacks, it is partnering to obtain.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re building a full-stack ecosystem with Korean AI chipmaker Rebellions, securing trusted data partnerships through work with the government and universities, and fostering a global research network,” said Kim. “That includes projects like our collaboration with MIT (MGAIC), which applies foundation models to advanced manufacturing and battery and semiconductor innovation.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-naver-cloud-hyperclova-x"&gt;Naver Cloud: HyperCLOVA X&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Naver Cloud, the cloud services arm of South Korea’s leading internet company, introduced its large language model, HyperClova, in 2021. Two years later, it unveiled an upgraded version, HyperCLOVA X, along with new products powered by the technology: CLOVA X, an AI chatbot, and Cue, a generative AI-driven search engine positioned as a rival to Microsoft’s CoPilot-enhanced Bing and Google’s AI Overview. It also unveiled this year its multimodal reasoning AI model, HyperCLOVE X Think.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Naver Cloud believes the true power of LLMs is to serve as “connectors” linking legacy systems and siloed services to improve usefulness, according to a Naver spokesperson.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Naver stands out as Korea’s only company — and one of the few in the world — that can genuinely claim to have an “AI full stack.” It built its HyperCLOVA X model from scratch and runs the massive data centers, cloud services, AI platforms, applications, and consumer services that bring the technology to life, the spokesperson explained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similar to Google — but tuned for South Korea — Naver is embedding its AI into core services like search, shopping, maps, and finance. Its advantage is real-world data. It’s AI Shopping Guide, for instance, offers recommendations based on what people actually want to buy. Other services include CLOVA Studio, which lets businesses build custom generative AI, and CLOVA Carecall, an AI-powered check-in service geared for seniors living alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Naver spokesperson says besting global AI giants like OpenAI and Google hinges on two things: perfecting its “recipe” for models and securing the capital to scale them. Even so, rather than chasing size, the company emphasizes sophistication, arguing its AI is already globally competitive at comparable scales.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-upstage-s-solar-pro-2-nbsp"&gt;Upstage’s Solar Pro 2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Upstage is the only startup competing in the project. Its Solar Pro 2 model, launched last July, was the first Korean model recognized as a frontier model by Artificial Analysis, putting it in the ring with OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic, according to Soon-il Kwon, executive vice president at Upstage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While most frontier models have 100 billion to 200 billion parameters, Solar Pro 2 — with just 31 billion — performs better for South Koreans and is more cost-effective, Kwon told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Solar Pro 2 has outperformed global models on major Korean benchmarks. With this project, Upstage aims to achieve a Korean language performance of 105% of the global standard,” Kwon said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Upstage aims to differentiate itself by focusing on real business impact, not just benchmarks, he said. So it is developing specialized models for industries like finance, law, and medicine, while pushing to build a Korean AI ecosystem led by “AI-native” startups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/shutterstock_345588500.jpg?w=1000" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;From tech giants to startups, South Korean players are developing large language models tailored to their own language and culture, ready to compete with global heavyweights like OpenAI and Google.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While most frontier models have 100 billion to 200 billion parameters, Solar Pro 2 — with just 31 billion — performs better for South Koreans and is more cost-effective, Kwon told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Solar Pro 2 has outperformed global models on major Korean benchmarks. With this project, Upstage aims to achieve a Korean language performance of 105% of the global standard,” Kwon said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Upstage aims to differentiate itself by focusing on real business impact, not just benchmarks, he said. So it is developing specialized models for industries like finance, law, and medicine, while pushing to build a Korean AI ecosystem led by “AI-native” startups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/27/how-south-korea-plans-to-best-openai-google-others-with-homegrown-ai/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] AI startup Friend spent more than $1M on all those subway ads (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/27/ai-startup-friend-spent-more-than-1m-on-all-those-subway-ads/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gettyimages-185054053.jpg?w=1000" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;If you’ve been on the New York City subway recently, you’ve probably seen stark white ads promoting a wearable AI device called Friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Avi Schiffman told Adweek that the company spent more than $1 million on a campaign with more than 11,000 cards on subway cars, 1,000 platform posters, and 130 urban panels. Some stations, like West 4th Street, are completely dominated by Friend ads.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is the world’s first major AI campaign,” Schiffman said. (There have been other AI ads of questionable effectiveness, but perhaps not a print campaign of this scale.) He described it as “a huge gamble,” adding, “I don’t have much money left.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Friend’s $129 device has been controversial, with Wired writers recently criticizing its constant surveillance and declaring, “I Hate My Friend.” Similarly, some Friend ads have been vandalized with messages calling it “surveillance capitalism” and urging spectators to “get real friends.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Schiffman said he’s well aware that “people in New York hate AI … probably more than anywhere else in the country,” so he deliberately bought ads with lots of white space “so that they would socially comment on the topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
