On Thursday she rejected their dismissal requests and set the case for a jury trial in late April, meaning they’ll officially duke it out in an Oakland courtroom, with Microsoft also dragged into the legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The backstory reads like a tech soap opera. Musk and Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI with others in 2015 as a nonprofit with lofty charitable goals. But those fuzzy feelings didn’t last — Musk left and in 2023 started his own AI company, xAI, and now claims his former partners betrayed their mission by taking billions from Microsoft and restructuring as a for-profit.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The relationships have seemingly curdled across the board. OpenAI and Microsoft remain business partners but increasingly compete head-to-head in AI. Meanwhile, Musk and Altman have gone from collaborators to archenemies, with OpenAI dismissing Musk’s lawsuit as “baseless” and “harassment” and an attempt to slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The judge found enough evidence to let a jury decide whether OpenAI broke its nonprofit commitments. A jury will also now decide whether Microsoft knowingly helped OpenAI break its promises, though the judge dismissed Musk’s claim that Microsoft unjustly enriched itself at his expense.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1126475976.jpg?resize=1200,1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI and Microsoft tried to dodge a courtroom showdown with Elon Musk, but a federal judge wasn’t having it, as reported earlier by Bloomberg.

The move underscores how India is becoming a key battleground for AI companies looking to expand beyond the U.S. for major growth markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ghose brings deep big-tech operating experience to the role. She spent 24 years at Microsoft before stepping down in December 2025. Her appointment gives Anthropic a seasoned executive with local enterprise and government relationships as it gears up to establish an on-the-ground presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing AI markets.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has become one of Anthropic’s most strategically important markets, with the country already ranking as the second-largest user base for Claude and usage heavily skewing toward technical and work-related tasks, including software development. Arch-rival OpenAI is also sharpening its focus on the market with plans to open an office in New Delhi — a sign India is fast becoming one of the most contested arenas in the global race to commercialize generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While India offers enormous scale — with more than a billion internet subscribers and over 700 million smartphone users — converting that reach into meaningful revenue has proven difficult, pushing AI companies to experiment with aggressive pricing and promotions. OpenAI last year introduced ChatGPT Go, its under-$5 plan aimed at attracting Indian users, and later made it available free for a year in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similar dynamics are playing out for Anthropic: Its Claude app recorded a 48% increase from the previous year in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs, while consumer spending surged 572% to $195,000 for the month, per Appfigures — still modest compared with the U.S., where September spending hit $2.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic has been stepping up its engagement in India at the highest levels. Chief executive Dario Amodei visited in October and met corporate executives and lawmakers, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to discuss the company’s expansion plans and growing adoption of its tools. Anthropic had also explored a potential partnership with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries to broaden access to Claude, as TechCrunch reported previously. Reliance, however, ultimately struck a deal with Google to offer its Gemini AI Pro plan free to Jio subscribers. That move came as rival Bharti Airtel partnered with Perplexity to bundle access to its premium subscription, underscoring how India’s telecom giants have become critical distribution gatekeepers in the race to scale consumer AI services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a LinkedIn post announcing the move, Ghose said she would focus on working with Indian enterprises, developers, and startups adopting Claude for “mission-critical” use cases, pointing to growing demand for what she described as “high-trust, enterprise-grade AI.” She added that AI tailored to local languages could be a “force multiplier” across sectors including education and healthcare — signaling Anthropic’s intent to deepen adoption beyond early tech users into larger institutions and the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The push by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Perplexity comes as India’s homegrown GenAI ecosystem remains relatively early-stage. While the country has a deep pool of software talent and a fast-growing base of AI users, it has produced few startups building large foundation models, with investors instead largely backing application-layer companies rather than committing the scale of capital typically required to train frontier systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The appointment also comes ahead of India’s AI Impact Summit 2026 in February, where the Indian government is expected to bring together AI startups, global CEOs, and industry experts to discuss the next phase of AI deployment in the country. The summit is part of New Delhi’s broader effort to signal support for domestic AI development and position India as a serious player in the global AI landscape, as competition intensifies across major markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic is also building out its India team, with job listings for roles including startup and enterprise account executives as well as a partner sales manager, signaling a push to deepen its go-to-market efforts and tap Indian businesses and startups as customers as it expands its presence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Anthropic, the hire adds senior local leadership as it looks to turn India’s surging usage into a durable business, navigating a market where distribution partnerships, pricing pressure, and enterprise adoption will shape which AI players emerge as long-term winners.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/anthropic-image-jagmeet-singh-techcrunch.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Anthropic has appointed Irina Ghose, a former Microsoft India managing director, to lead its India business as the U.S. AI startup prepares to open an office in Bengaluru.

As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A base-edited baby!&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took&amp;nbsp;his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;KJ’s&amp;nbsp;story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics,&amp;nbsp;a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have&amp;nbsp;described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Gene resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the&amp;nbsp;woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called&amp;nbsp;“woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves&amp;nbsp;is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about&amp;nbsp;the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in&amp;nbsp;attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Embryo scoring&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is&amp;nbsp;controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that&amp;nbsp;doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing,&amp;nbsp;you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to&amp;nbsp;have their “best baby.” Read more&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in&amp;nbsp;attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Embryo scoring&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is&amp;nbsp;controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that&amp;nbsp;doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing,&amp;nbsp;you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to&amp;nbsp;have their “best baby.” Read more&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

According to Plumery, the product is intended to reduce reliance on bespoke integrations and to promote an event-driven, API-first architecture that can scale as institutions grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge it seeks to address is recognised in the sector. Banks have invested heavily in AI experimentation over the past decade, but many deployments remain limited. Research by McKinsey suggests that while generative AI could materially improve productivity and customer experience in financial services, most banks struggle to translate pilots into production because of fragmented data estates and incumbent operating models. The consultancy argues that enterprise-level AI adoption requires shared infrastructure and governance, and reusable data products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comments accompanying the product launch, Plumery’s founder and chief executive, Ben Goldin, said financial institutions are clear about what they expect from AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They want real production use cases that improve customer experience and operations, but they will not compromise on governance, security or control,” he said. “The event-driven data mesh architecture transforms how banking data is produced, shared, and consumed, not adding another AI layer on top of fragmented systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fragmented data remains a barrier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data fragmentation remains one of the obstacles to operational AI in banking. Many institutions rely on legacy core systems that sit in newer digital channels, creating silos in products and customer journeys. Each AI initiative requires fresh integration work, security reviews, and governance approvals, thus increasing costs and slowing delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Academic and industry research supports this diagnosis. Studies on explainable AI in financial services note that fragmented pipelines make it harder to trace decisions and increase regulatory risk, particularly in areas like credit scoring and anti-money-laundering. Regulators have made clear that banks must be able to explain and audit AI-driven outcomes, regardless of where the models are developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plumery says its AI Fabric addresses such issues by presenting domain-oriented banking data as governed streams that can be reused in multiple use cases. The company argues that separating systems of record from systems of engagement and intelligence allows banks to innovate more safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Evidence of AI already in production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, AI is already embedded in many parts of the financial sector. Case studies compiled by industry analysts show widespread use of machine learning and natural language processing in customer service, risk management, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citibank, for example, has deployed AI-powered chatbots to handle routine customer enquiries, reducing pressure on call centres and improving response times. Other large banks use predictive analytics to monitor loan portfolios and anticipate defaults. Santander has publicly described its use of machine learning models to assess credit risk and strengthen portfolio management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fraud detection is another mature area. Banks rely increasingly on AI systems to analyse transaction patterns, flagging anomalous behaviour more effectively than rule-based systems. Research from technology consultancies notes that such models depend on high-quality data flows, and that integration complexity remains a limiting factor for smaller institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More advanced applications are emerging at the margins. Academic research into large language models suggests that, under strict governance, conversational AI could support certain transactional and advisory functions in retail banking. However, these implementations remain experimental and are closely scrutinised due to their regulatory implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Platform providers and ecosystem approaches&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plumery operates in a competitive market of digital banking platforms that position themselves as orchestration layers rather than replacements for core systems. The company has entered partnerships designed to fit into broader fintech ecosystems. Its integration with Ozone API, an open banking infrastructure provider, was presented as a way for banks to deliver standards-compliant services more quickly, without custom development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its approach reflects a wider industry trend towards composable architectures. Vendors like Backbase and others promote API-centric platforms that allow banks to plug in AI, analytics, and third-party services to the existing core. Analysts agree generally that such architectures are better suited to incremental innovation than large-scale system replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Readiness remains uneven&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that readiness in the sector is uneven. A report by Boston Consulting Group found that fewer than a quarter of banks believe they are prepared for large-scale AI adoption. The gap, it argued, lies in governance, data foundations, and operating discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators have responded by offering controlled environments for experimentation. In the UK, regulatory sandbox initiatives allow banks to test new technologies, including AI. These programmes are intended to support innovation and reinforce accountability and risk management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For vendors like Plumery, the opportunity lies in providing infrastructure that aligns technological ambition and regulatory reality. AI Fabric enters a market where demand for operational AI is apparent, but where success depends on proving that new tools can be safe and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Plumery’s approach becomes a adopted standard remains uncertain. As banks move from experimentation to production, the focus is moving towards the architectures that support AI. In that context, platforms that can demonstrate technical flexibility and governance adherence are more likely to play an important role in the digital banking’s next phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Colorful Shale Strata of the Morrison Formation at the Edge of the San Rafael Swell” by Jesse Varner is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

 &lt;p&gt;If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity.

It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity.

His startup, &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen Labs&lt;/a&gt;, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/employee-benefits/zuckerbergs-100-million-ai-job-offers-pay-off-parmy-olson"&gt;$100 million offers&lt;/a&gt; seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a &lt;a href="https://billboardinsider.com/ai-startup/"&gt;billboard in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by &lt;a href="https://www.ribbitcap.com/"&gt;Ribbit Capital&lt;/a&gt; with participation from &lt;a href="https://www.evantic.ai/"&gt;Evantic&lt;/a&gt; and existing investors &lt;a href="https://sequoiacap.com/"&gt;Sequoia Capital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.conviction.com/"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pear.vc/"&gt;Pear VC&lt;/a&gt;. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When you obsess over customers, everything else follows,&amp;quot; Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/role/agencies"&gt;AI researcher&lt;/a&gt; finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: &amp;quot;Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can&amp;#x27;t get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys.&amp;quot; The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, &amp;quot;gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they&amp;#x27;re talking about. And the problem is you can&amp;#x27;t scale that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes Listen&amp;#x27;s approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. &amp;quot;In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options,&amp;quot; Wahlforss said. &amp;quot;Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraud&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen&lt;/a&gt; finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called &amp;quot;one of the most shocking things that we&amp;#x27;ve learned when we entered this industry&amp;quot;—rampant fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Essentially, there&amp;#x27;s a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players,&amp;quot; he explained. &amp;quot;We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company built what it calls a &amp;quot;quality guard&amp;quot; that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: &amp;quot;People talk three times more. They&amp;#x27;re much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/emeritus"&gt;Emeritus&lt;/a&gt;, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. &amp;quot;We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information,&amp;quot; said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better products&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed advantage has proven central to Listen&amp;#x27;s pitch. Traditional customer research at &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; could take four to six weeks to generate insights. &amp;quot;By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it,&amp;quot; said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. &amp;quot;We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward,&amp;quot; Patel said, &amp;quot;and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day.&amp;quot; Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/simple-modern"&gt;Simple Modern&lt;/a&gt;, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept. The process took about an hour to write questions, an hour to launch the study, and 2.5 hours to receive feedback from 120 people across the country. &amp;quot;We went from &amp;#x27;Should we even have this product?&amp;#x27; to &amp;#x27;How should we launch it?&amp;#x27;&amp;quot; said Chris Hoyle, the company&amp;#x27;s Chief Marketing Officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/chubbies"&gt;Chubbies&lt;/a&gt;, the shorts brand, achieved a 24x increase in youth research participation—growing from 5 to 120 participants — by using Listen to overcome the scheduling challenges of traditional focus groups with children. &amp;quot;There&amp;#x27;s school, sports, dinner, and homework,&amp;quot; explained Lauren Neville, Director of Insights and Innovation. &amp;quot;I had to find a way to hear from them that fit into their schedules.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also discovered product issues through AI interviews that might have gone undetected otherwise. Wahlforss described how the AI &amp;quot;through conversations, realized there were like issues with the the kids short line, and decided to, like, interview hundreds of kids. And I understand that there were issues in the liner of the shorts and that they were, like, scratchy, quote, unquote, according to the people interviewed.&amp;quot; The redesigned product became &amp;quot;a blockbuster hit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Jevons paradox explains why cheaper research creates more demand, not less&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen Labs&lt;/a&gt; is entering a massive but fragmented market. Wahlforss cited research from Andreessen Horowitz estimating the market research industry at roughly &lt;a href="https://a16z.com/ai-market-research/"&gt;$140 billion annually&lt;/a&gt;, populated by legacy players — some with more than a billion dollars in revenue — that he believes are vulnerable to disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are very much existing budget lines that we are replacing,&amp;quot; Wahlforss said. &amp;quot;Why we&amp;#x27;re replacing them is that one, they&amp;#x27;re super costly. Two, they&amp;#x27;re kind of stuck in this old paradigm of choosing between a survey or interview, and they also take months to work with.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the more intriguing dynamic may be that AI-powered research doesn&amp;#x27;t just replace existing spending — it creates new demand. Wahlforss invoked the Jevons paradox, an economic principle that occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use, but increased efficiency leads to increased overall consumption rather than decreased consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What I&amp;#x27;ve noticed is that as something gets cheaper, you don&amp;#x27;t need less of it. You want more of it,&amp;quot; Wahlforss explained. &amp;quot;There&amp;#x27;s infinite demand for customer understanding. So the researchers on the team can do an order of magnitude more research, and also other people who weren&amp;#x27;t researchers before can now do that as part of their job.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inside the elite engineering team that built Listen Labs before they had a working toilet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen Labs&lt;/a&gt; traces its origins to a consumer app that Wahlforss and his co-founder built after meeting at Harvard. &amp;quot;We built this consumer app that got 20,000 downloads in one day,&amp;quot; Wahlforss recalled. &amp;quot;We had all these users, and we were thinking like, okay, what can we do to get to know them better? And we built this prototype of what Listen is today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founding team brings an unusual pedigree. Wahlforss&amp;#x27;s co-founder &amp;quot;was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot.&amp;quot; The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the &lt;a href="https://ioinformatics.org/"&gt;International Olympiad in Informatics&lt;/a&gt; — the same competition that produced the founders of &lt;a href="https://cognition.ai/"&gt;Cognition&lt;/a&gt;, the AI coding startup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/san-francisco-billboard-challenge-puts-ai-engineers-to-the-test/"&gt;Berghain billboard stunt&lt;/a&gt; generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But now we fixed that situation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building next&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building &amp;quot;the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we&amp;#x27;ve done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. &amp;quot;Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. &amp;quot;Obviously, as you said, there&amp;#x27;s kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company already handles sensitive data with care. &amp;quot;We don&amp;#x27;t train on any of the data,&amp;quot; Wahlforss said. &amp;quot;We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that. And there are times when, for example, you work with investors, where if you accidentally mention something that could be material, non public information, the AI can actually detect that and remove any information like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How AI could reshape the future of product development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most provocative implication of Listen&amp;#x27;s model is how it could reshape product development itself. Wahlforss described a customer — an Australian startup — that has adopted what amounts to a continuous feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They&amp;#x27;re based in Australia, so they&amp;#x27;re coding during the day, and then in their night, they&amp;#x27;re releasing a Listen study with an American audience. Listen validates whatever they built during the day, and they get feedback on that. They can then plug that feedback directly into coding tools like Claude Code and iterate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision extends Y Combinator&amp;#x27;s famous dictum — &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4D-yc-s-essential-startup-advice"&gt;write code, talk to users&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — into an automated cycle. &amp;quot;Write code is now getting automated. And I think like talk to users will be as well, and you&amp;#x27;ll have this kind of infinite loop where you can start to ship this truly amazing product, almost kind of autonomously.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that vision materializes depends on factors beyond Listen&amp;#x27;s control — the continued improvement of AI models, enterprise willingness to trust automated research, and whether speed truly correlates with better products. A &lt;a href="https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf"&gt;2024 MIT study&lt;/a&gt; found that 95% of AI pilots fail to move into production, a statistic Wahlforss cited as the reason he emphasizes quality over demos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m constantly have to emphasize like, let&amp;#x27;s make sure the quality is there and the details are right,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company&amp;#x27;s growth suggests appetite for the experiment. Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Patel said Listen has &amp;quot;removed the drudgery of research and brought the fun and joy back into my work.&amp;quot; Chubbies is now pushing its founder to give everyone in the company a login. Sling Money, a stablecoin payments startup, can create a survey in ten minutes and receive results the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s a total game changer,&amp;quot; said Ali Romero, Sling Money&amp;#x27;s marketing manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss has a different phrase for what he&amp;#x27;s building. When asked about the tension between speed and rigor — the long-held belief that moving fast means cutting corners — he cited Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO and Listen investor, who keeps a list of one-liners on his website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them: &amp;quot;Slow is fake.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s an aggressive claim for an industry built on methodological caution. But &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen Labs&lt;/a&gt; is betting that in the AI era, the companies that listen fastest will be the ones that win. The only question is whether customers will talk back.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup, &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen Labs&lt;/a&gt;, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/employee-benefits/zuckerbergs-100-million-ai-job-offers-pay-off-parmy-olson"&gt;$100 million offers&lt;/a&gt; seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a &lt;a href="https://billboardinsider.com/ai-startup/"&gt;billboard in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by &lt;a href="https://www.ribbitcap.com/"&gt;Ribbit Capital&lt;/a&gt; with participation from &lt;a href="https://www.evantic.ai/"&gt;Evantic&lt;/a&gt; and existing investors &lt;a href="https://sequoiacap.com/"&gt;Sequoia Capital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.conviction.com/"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pear.vc/"&gt;Pear VC&lt;/a&gt;. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When you obsess over customers, everything else follows,&amp;quot; Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/role/agencies"&gt;AI researcher&lt;/a&gt; finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: &amp;quot;Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can&amp;#x27;t get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys.&amp;quot; The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, &amp;quot;gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they&amp;#x27;re talking about. And the problem is you can&amp;#x27;t scale that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes Listen&amp;#x27;s approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. &amp;quot;In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options,&amp;quot; Wahlforss said. &amp;quot;Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraud&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen&lt;/a&gt; finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called &amp;quot;one of the most shocking things that we&amp;#x27;ve learned when we entered this industry&amp;quot;—rampant fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Essentially, there&amp;#x27;s a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players,&amp;quot; he explained. &amp;quot;We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company built what it calls a &amp;quot;quality guard&amp;quot; that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: &amp;quot;People talk three times more. They&amp;#x27;re much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/emeritus"&gt;Emeritus&lt;/a&gt;, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. &amp;quot;We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information,&amp;quot; said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better products&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed advantage has proven central to Listen&amp;#x27;s pitch. Traditional customer research at &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; could take four to six weeks to generate insights. &amp;quot;By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it,&amp;quot; said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. &amp;quot;We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward,&amp;quot; Patel said, &amp;quot;and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day.&amp;quot; Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/simple-modern"&gt;Simple Modern&lt;/a&gt;, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armed with determination, Claude, and ChatGPT, Yu decided to just build a dining app from scratch — one that would recommend restaurants to her and her friends based on their shared interests.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Once vibe-coding apps emerged, I started hearing about people with no tech backgrounds successfully building their own apps,” she told TechCrunch. “When I had a week off before school started, I decided it was the perfect time to finally build my application.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So, she created the web app Where2Eat to help her and her friends find a place to eat.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yu is part of the growing trend of people who, due to rapid advancements in AI technology, can easily build their own apps for personal use. Most are coding web applications, though they are also increasingly vibe coding mobile apps intended to run only on their own personal phones and devices. Some who are already registered as Apple developers are leaving their personal apps in beta on TestFlight.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It is a new era of app creation that is sometimes called micro apps, personal apps, or fleeting apps because they are intended to be used only by the creator (or the creator plus a select few other people) and only for as long as the creator wants to keep the app. They are not intended for wide distribution or sale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, founder Jordi Amat told TechCrunch that he built a fleeting web gaming app for his family to play over the holidays and simply shut it down once the vacation was over.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then there’s Shamillah Bankiya, a partner at Dawn Capital, who is building a podcast translation web app for personal use. Interestingly enough, Darrell Etherington, a former TechCrunch writer, now a vice president at SBS Comms, is also building his own personal podcast translation app. “A lot of people I know are using Claude Code, Replit, Bolt, and Lovable to build apps for specific use cases,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One artist told TechCrunch that he built a “vice tracker” for himself to see how many hookahs and drinks he was consuming each weekend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even professional developers are vibe coding personal apps. Software engineer James Waugh told TechCrunch he built a web app planning tool to help with his cooking hobby.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-web-apps-and-mobile"&gt;Web apps and mobile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Because tools ranging from Claude Code to Lovable typically don’t require robust coding knowledge just to get to a functional app,&amp;nbsp;we are witnessing the early rise of micro apps. These are apps that are extremely context-specific, address niche needs, and then “disappear when the need is no longer present,” Legand L. Burge III, a professor of computer science at Howard University, said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s similar to how trends on social media appear and then fade away,” Burge III continued. “But now, [it’s] software itself.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yu said she now has six more ideas she wants to code. “It’s really exciting to be alive right now,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In some ways, it was always easy for someone without much coding experience to create web apps via no-code platforms like Bubble and Adalo, which launched before LLMs became popular. What’s new is the rising ability to create personal, temporary apps for mobile devices, too. Also new: the growing realization that anyone can code just by describing, in regular language, the app they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mobile micro apps still aren’t as easy as their web counterparts. This is because the standard way to load an app on an iPhone is to download it from the App Store, which requires a paid Apple Developer account. But increasingly mobile vibe-coding startups like Anything (which raised $11 million, led by Footwork) and VibeCode (which raised a $9.4 million seed round from Seven Seven Six last year) have emerged to help people build mobile apps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Christina Melas-Kyriazi, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, compared this era of app building to social media and Shopify, “where all of a sudden it was really easy to create content or to create a store online, and then we saw an explosion of small sellers.” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-good-enough-for-one-nbsp"&gt;Good enough for one&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, micro apps also have issues. Building and sharing the code with other people can become somewhat expensive given the subscriptions required, especially if all the costs are associated with just one app. Building an app also remains tedious for some. Yu, for example, said her dining app wasn’t hard to create; it was just very time-consuming. She had to lean on ChatGPT and Claude to help her understand some coding decisions. “Once I learned how to prompt and solve issues efficiently, building became much easier,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then there are quality issues. Such personal apps may have bugs or critical security flaws — they can’t just be sold as-is to the masses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But there is still significant potential in an era of personal app building, especially as AI and model reasoning, quality, and security become more sophisticated over time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The software engineer, Waugh, said he once built an app for a friend who had heart palpitations. He built her a logger that let her record when she was having heart issues so she could more easily show her doctor. “Great example of a one-off personal software that helps you keep track of something important,” he told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another founder, Nick Simpson, told TechCrunch he was so bad at paying parking tickets — the consequence of San Francisco’s tough parking availability — that he decided to build an app that would automatically pay them after scanning the ticket. As a registered Apple developer, his app is in beta on TestFlight, but he said a bunch of his friends now want it, too.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nevertheless, Burge III believes that these types of apps can open “exhilarating opportunities” for businesses and creators to create “hyper-personalized situational experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Etherington added to that, saying he believes a day is dawning when people stop subscribing to apps that have monthly fees. Instead, they will just build their own apps for personal use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Melas-Kyriazi, meanwhile, expects to see the use of personal, fleeting apps the same way spreadsheets like Google Sheets or Excel were once used.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s really going to fill the gap between the spreadsheet and a full-fledged product,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One media strategist, Hollie Krause, said she didn’t like the apps her doctor kept recommending, so she built one herself that can help her track her allergies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She had no technical experience and finished the web app in the same time it took her husband to go to dinner and back. Now, she said, they have two web apps, both built with Claude: one for allergies and sensitivities, and the other to keep tabs on chores around the house.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I was like ‘wow I hate Excel but I’d love to make an app for our household,” Krause told TechCrunch. “So, I spun it up and hosted it on Tiiny.host and popped it on our cellphones.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She thinks vibe coding will bring “a lot of innovation and problem solving for communities that wouldn’t have access otherwise,” and hopes to beta-test her allergy health app so she can one day release it to others.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The app will be to help others who struggle to navigate life for themselves, and for caregivers to also be able to have access,” she said. “I truly think that vibe coding means I can help people.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Donald-Iain-Smith.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;It took Rebecca Yu seven days to vibe code her dining app. She was tired of the decision fatigue that comes from people in a group chat not being able to decide where to eat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armed with determination, Claude, and ChatGPT, Yu decided to just build a dining app from scratch — one that would recommend restaurants to her and her friends based on their shared interests.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Once vibe-coding apps emerged, I started hearing about people with no tech backgrounds successfully building their own apps,” she told TechCrunch. “When I had a week off before school started, I decided it was the perfect time to finally build my application.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Ashley St Clair, the influencer and mother of one of Elon Musk’s children, has sued the billionaire’s AI company, accusing its Grok chatbot of creating fake sexual imagery of her without her consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, filed in New York state court, St Clair alleged that xAI’s Grok first created an AI-generated or altered image of her in a bikini earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Clair claims she made a request to xAI that no further such images be made, but nevertheless “countless sexually abusive, intimate, and degrading deepfake content of St. Clair [were] produced and distributed publicly by Grok.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one case, a photo of St Clair from when she was 14 years old was altered by Grok to undress her and put her in a bikini, according to the court filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Clair is a conservative influencer with about 1 million followers on X and the mother of one of Musk’s children. The billionaire entrepreneur has espoused pronatalist views, arguing in support of increasing birth rates, and has fathered at least 14 children with several different women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reporting the images to xAI, St Clair’s account on the X social media platform was stripped of its verification checkmark, premium subscription, and ability to monetize her posts, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case has now been moved to federal court. xAI, which runs X, did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The news comes as xAI and Musk have come under fire over fake sexualized images of women and children, which proliferated on the platform this year, particularly after Musk jokingly shared an AI-altered post of himself in a bikini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, the issue has prompted threats of fines and bans in the EU, UK, and France, as well as investigations by the California attorney-general and Britain’s Ofcom regulator. Grok has also been banned in Indonesia and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, xAI took action to restrict the image-generation function on its Grok AI model to block the chatbot from undressing users, insisting that it removed Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Clair, who has in recent months been increasingly critical of Musk, is also seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent xAI from generating images that undress her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ms St Clair is humiliated, depressed, fearful for her life, angry and desperately in need of action from this court to protect her against xAI’s facilitation of this unfathomable nightmare,” lawyers wrote in a filing seeking the restraining order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI filed a lawsuit against St Clair in Texas on Thursday, claiming she had breached the company’s terms of service by bringing her lawsuit against the company in a New York court instead of in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Musk also said on X that he would be filing for “full custody” of their 1-year-old son Romulus, after St Clair apologized for sharing posts critical of transgender people in the past. Musk, who has a transgender child, has repeatedly been critical of transgender people and the rights of trans individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Ashley St Clair, the influencer and mother of one of Elon Musk’s children, has sued the billionaire’s AI company, accusing its Grok chatbot of creating fake sexual imagery of her without her consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, filed in New York state court, St Clair alleged that xAI’s Grok first created an AI-generated or altered image of her in a bikini earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Clair claims she made a request to xAI that no further such images be made, but nevertheless “countless sexually abusive, intimate, and degrading deepfake content of St. Clair [were] produced and distributed publicly by Grok.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one case, a photo of St Clair from when she was 14 years old was altered by Grok to undress her and put her in a bikini, according to the court filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Clair is a conservative influencer with about 1 million followers on X and the mother of one of Musk’s children. The billionaire entrepreneur has espoused pronatalist views, arguing in support of increasing birth rates, and has fathered at least 14 children with several different women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reporting the images to xAI, St Clair’s account on the X social media platform was stripped of its verification checkmark, premium subscription, and ability to monetize her posts, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case has now been moved to federal court. xAI, which runs X, did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news comes as xAI and Musk have come under fire over fake sexualized images of women and children, which proliferated on the platform this year, particularly after Musk jokingly shared an AI-altered post of himself in a bikini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, the issue has prompted threats of fines and bans in the EU, UK, and France, as well as investigations by the California attorney-general and Britain’s Ofcom regulator. Grok has also been banned in Indonesia and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, xAI took action to restrict the image-generation function on its Grok AI model to block the chatbot from undressing users, insisting that it removed Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;xAI filed a lawsuit against St Clair in Texas on Thursday, claiming she had breached the company’s terms of service by bringing her lawsuit against the company in a New York court instead of in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Musk also said on X that he would be filing for “full custody” of their 1-year-old son Romulus, after St Clair apologized for sharing posts critical of transgender people in the past.

          &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported record fourth-quarter earnings and said it expects AI chip demand to continue for years. During an earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei told investors that while he cannot predict the semiconductor industry’s long-term trajectory, he remains bullish on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSMC manufactures chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, making it a linchpin of the global electronics supply chain. The company produces the vast majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, and its factories in Taiwan have become a focal point of US-China tensions over technology and trade. When TSMC reports strong demand and ramps up spending, it signals that the companies designing AI chips expect years of continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real—not only real, it’s starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of—we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that,” Wei said during the call. “So another question is ‘can the semiconductor industry be good for three, four, five years in a row?’ I’ll tell you the truth, I don’t know. But I look at the AI, it looks like it’s going to be like an endless—I mean, that for many years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TSMC posted net income of NT$505.7 billion (about $16 billion) for the quarter, up 35 percent year over year and above analyst expectations. Revenue hit $33.7 billion, a 25.5 percent increase from the same period last year. The company expects nearly 30 percent revenue growth in 2026 and plans to spend between $52 billion and $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, up from $40.9 billion in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Checking with the customers’ customers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wei’s optimism stands in contrast to months of speculation about whether the AI industry is in a bubble. In November, Google CEO Sundar Pichai warned of “irrationality” in the AI market and said no company would be immune if a potential bubble bursts. OpenAI’s Sam Altman acknowledged in August that investors are “overexcited” and that “someone” will lose a “phenomenal amount of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But TSMC, which manufactures the chips that power the AI boom, is betting the opposite way, with Wei telling analysts he spoke directly to cloud providers to verify that demand is real before committing to the spending increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to make sure that my customers’ demand are real. So I talked to those cloud service providers, all of them,” Wei said. “The answer is that I’m quite satisfied with the answer. Actually, they show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earnings report landed the same day the US and Taiwan finalized a trade agreement that cuts tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15 percent, down from 20 percent. The deal commits Taiwanese companies to $250 billion in direct US investment, and TSMC is accelerating the expansion of its Arizona chip fabrication facilities to match.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported record fourth-quarter earnings and said it expects AI chip demand to continue for years. During an earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei told investors that while he cannot predict the semiconductor industry’s long-term trajectory, he remains bullish on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSMC manufactures chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, making it a linchpin of the global electronics supply chain. The company produces the vast majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, and its factories in Taiwan have become a focal point of US-China tensions over technology and trade. When TSMC reports strong demand and ramps up spending, it signals that the companies designing AI chips expect years of continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real—not only real, it’s starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of—we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that,” Wei said during the call. “So another question is ‘can the semiconductor industry be good for three, four, five years in a row?’ I’ll tell you the truth, I don’t know. But I look at the AI, it looks like it’s going to be like an endless—I mean, that for many years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;TSMC posted net income of NT$505.7 billion (about $16 billion) for the quarter, up 35 percent year over year and above analyst expectations. Revenue hit $33.7 billion, a 25.5 percent increase from the same period last year. The company expects nearly 30 percent revenue growth in 2026 and plans to spend between $52 billion and $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, up from $40.9 billion in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Checking with the customers’ customers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wei’s optimism stands in contrast to months of speculation about whether the AI industry is in a bubble. In November, Google CEO Sundar Pichai warned of “irrationality” in the AI market and said no company would be immune if a potential bubble bursts. OpenAI’s Sam Altman acknowledged in August that investors are “overexcited” and that “someone” will lose a “phenomenal amount of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But TSMC, which manufactures the chips that power the AI boom, is betting the opposite way, with Wei telling analysts he spoke directly to cloud providers to verify that demand is real before committing to the spending increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to make sure that my customers’ demand are real. So I talked to those cloud service providers, all of them,” Wei said. “The answer is that I’m quite satisfied with the answer. Actually, they show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earnings report landed the same day the US and Taiwan finalized a trade agreement that cuts tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15 percent, down from 20 percent. The deal commits Taiwanese companies to $250 billion in direct US investment, and TSMC is accelerating the expansion of its Arizona chip fabrication facilities to match.&lt;/p&gt;
