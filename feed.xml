            &lt;p&gt;Any motorist who has ever waited through multiple cycles for a traffic light to turn green knows how annoying signalized intersections can be. But sitting at intersections isn’t just a drag on drivers’ patience — unproductive vehicle idling could contribute as much as 15 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. land transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale modeling study led by MIT researchers reveals that eco-driving measures, which can involve dynamically adjusting vehicle speeds to reduce stopping and excessive acceleration, could significantly reduce those CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a powerful artificial intelligence method called deep reinforcement learning, the researchers conducted an in-depth impact assessment of the factors affecting vehicle emissions in three major U.S. cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analysis indicates that fully adopting eco-driving measures could cut annual city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11 to 22 percent, without slowing traffic throughput or affecting vehicle and traffic safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if only 10 percent of vehicles on the road employ eco-driving, it would result in 25 to 50 percent of the total reduction in CO2 emissions, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, dynamically optimizing speed limits at about 20 percent of intersections provides 70 percent of the total emission benefits. This indicates that eco-driving measures could be implemented gradually while still having measurable, positive impacts on mitigating climate change and improving public health.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;“Vehicle-based control strategies like eco-driving can move the needle on climate change reduction. We’ve shown here that modern machine-learning tools, like deep reinforcement learning, can accelerate the kinds of analysis that support sociotechnical decision making. This is just the tip of the iceberg,” says senior author Cathy Wu, the Thomas D. and Virginia W. Cabot Career Development Associate Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) at MIT, and a member of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is joined on the paper by lead author Vindula Jayawardana, an MIT graduate student; as well as MIT graduate students Ao Qu, Cameron Hickert, and Edgar Sanchez; MIT undergraduate Catherine Tang; Baptiste Freydt, a graduate student at ETH Zurich; and Mark Taylor and Blaine Leonard of the Utah Department of Transportation. The research appears in &lt;em&gt;Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A multi-part modeling study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic control measures typically call to mind fixed infrastructure, like stop signs and traffic signals. But as vehicles become more technologically advanced, it presents an opportunity for eco-driving, which is a catch-all term for vehicle-based traffic control measures like the use of dynamic speeds to reduce energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the near term, eco-driving could involve speed guidance in the form of vehicle dashboards or smartphone apps. In the longer term, eco-driving could involve intelligent speed commands that directly control the acceleration of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles through vehicle-to-infrastructure communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most prior work has focused on how&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;to implement eco-driving. We shifted the frame to consider the question of should&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;we implement eco-driving. If we were to deploy this technology at scale, would it make a difference?” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, the researchers embarked on a multifaceted modeling study that would take the better part of four years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They began by identifying 33 factors that influence vehicle emissions, including temperature, road grade, intersection topology, age of the vehicle, traffic demand, vehicle types, driver behavior, traffic signal timing, road geometry, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest challenges was making sure we were diligent and didn’t leave out any major factors,” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they used data from open street maps, U.S. geological surveys, and other sources to create digital replicas of more than 6,000 signalized intersections in three cities — Atlanta, San Francisco, and Los Angeles — and simulated more than a million traffic scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used deep reinforcement learning to optimize each scenario for eco-driving to achieve the maximum emissions benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning optimizes the vehicles’ driving behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a high-fidelity traffic simulator, rewarding vehicle behaviors that are more energy-efficient while penalizing those that are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, training vehicle behaviors that generalize across diverse intersection traffic scenarios was a major challenge. The researchers observed that some scenarios are more similar to one another than others, such as scenarios with the same number of lanes or the same number of traffic signal phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the researchers trained separate reinforcement learning models for different clusters of traffic scenarios, yielding better emission benefits overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with the help of AI, analyzing citywide traffic at the network level would be so computationally intensive it could take another decade to unravel, Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they broke the problem down and solved each eco-driving scenario at the individual intersection level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We carefully constrained the impact of eco-driving control at each intersection on neighboring intersections. In this way, we dramatically simplified the problem, which enabled us to perform this analysis at scale, without introducing unknown network effects,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant emissions benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they analyzed the results, the researchers found that full adoption of eco-driving could result in intersection emissions reductions of between 11 and 22 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits differ depending on the layout of a city’s streets. A denser city like San Francisco has less room to implement eco-driving between intersections, offering a possible explanation for reduced emission savings, while Atlanta could see greater benefits given its higher speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if only 10 percent of vehicles employ eco-driving, a city could still realize 25 to 50 percent of the total emissions benefit because of car-following dynamics: Non-eco-driving vehicles would follow controlled eco-driving vehicles as they optimize speed to pass smoothly through intersections, reducing their carbon emissions as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, eco-driving could also increase vehicle throughput by minimizing emissions. However, Wu cautions that increasing throughput could result in more drivers taking to the roads, reducing emissions benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while their analysis of widely used safety metrics known as surrogate safety measures, such as time to collision, suggest that eco-driving is as safe as human driving, it could cause unexpected behavior in human drivers. More research is needed to fully understand potential safety impacts, Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results also show that eco-driving could provide even greater benefits when combined with alternative transportation decarbonization solutions. For instance, 20 percent eco-driving adoption in San Francisco would cut emission levels by 7 percent, but when combined with the projected adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles, it would cut emissions by 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a first attempt to systematically quantify network-wide environmental benefits of eco-driving. This is a great research effort that will serve as a key reference for others to build on in the assessment of eco-driving systems,” says Hesham Rakha, the Samuel L. Pritchard Professor of Engineering at Virginia Tech, who was not involved with this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the researchers focus on carbon emissions, the benefits are highly correlated with improvements in fuel consumption, energy use, and air quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is almost a free intervention. We already have smartphones in our cars, and we are rapidly adopting cars with more advanced automation features. For something to scale quickly in practice, it must be relatively simple to implement and shovel-ready. Eco-driving fits that bill,” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is funded, in part, by Amazon and the Utah Department of Transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

They eventually spotted a clear pattern: &lt;strong&gt;Methane emissions had increased sharply across the tropics, where wetlands were growing wetter and warmer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That created the ideal conditions for microbes that thrive in anaerobic muck, which gobbled up more of the carbon-rich organic matter and spat out more methane as a by-product. (Reduced pollution from nitrogen oxides, which help to break down methane in the atmosphere, also likely played a substantial role.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; offer one of the clearest cases so far where climate change itself is driving additional greenhouse-gas emissions from natural systems&lt;/strong&gt;, triggering a feedback effect that threatens to produce more warming, more emissions, and on and on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are numerous additional ways this is happening or soon could, including wildfires and thawing permafrost. These are major emissions sources that aren’t included in the commitments nations have made under the Paris climate agreement—and climate risks that largely aren’t accounted for in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s most recent warming scenarios.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Spark Climate Solutions (not to be confused with this newsletter) hopes to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The San Francisco nonprofit is launching what’s known as a model intercomparison project,&lt;/strong&gt; in which different research teams run the same set of experiments on different models across a variety of emissions scenarios to determine how climate change could play out. This one would specifically explore how a range of climate feedback effects could propel additional warming, additional emissions, and additional types of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“These increased emissions from natural sources add to human emissions and amplify climate change,” says Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, who previously served as climate science advisor to President Joe Biden. &lt;strong&gt;“And if you don’t look at all of them together, you can’t quantify the strength of that feedback effect.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other participants in the effort will include scientists at the Environmental Defense Fund, Stanford University, the Woodwell Climate Research Center, and other institutions in Europe and Australia, according to Spark Climate Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The nonprofit hopes to publish the findings in time for them to be incorporated into the UN climate panel’s seventh major assessment report, which is just getting underway, to help ensure that these dangers are more fully represented. That, in turn, would give nations a more accurate sense of the world’s carbon budgets, or the quantity of greenhouse gases they can produce before the planet reaches temperatures 1.5 °C or&amp;nbsp; 2 °C over preindustrial levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But one thing is already clear: Since the current scenarios don’t fully account for these feedback effects, the world will almost certainly warm faster than is now forecast&lt;/strong&gt;, which underscores the importance of carrying out this exercise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Scientists at EDF, Woodwell and other institutions found that fires in the world’s northernmost forests, thawing permafrost and warming tropical wetlands could together push the planet beyond 2 °C years faster, eliminating up to a quarter of the time left before the world passes the core goal of the Paris agreement, in a paper under review.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Spark Climate Solutions set up a broader program to advance research and awareness of what’s known as warming-induced emissions, which will launch additional collaborations similar to the modeling intercomparison project.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The goal of the program and the research project is “to really mainstream the inclusion of this topic in climate science and climate policy, and to drive research around climate solutions,” says Ben Poulter, who leads the program at Spark Climate Solutions and was previously a scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Spark notes that warming temperatures could also release more carbon dioxide from the oceans, in a process known as outgassing; additional carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that also depletes the protective ozone layer, from farmland; more carbon dioxide and methane from wildfires; and still more of all three of these gases as permafrost thaws.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ground remains frozen year round across a vast expanse of the Northern Hemisphere, creating a frosty underground storehouse from Alaska to Siberia that’s packed with twice as much carbon as the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But as it thaws, it starts to decompose and release greenhouse gases,&lt;/strong&gt; says Susan Natali, an Arctic climate scientist focused on permafrost at Woodwell. A study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in January noted that 30% of the world’s Arctic–Boreal Zone has already flipped from a carbon sink to a carbon source, when wildfires, thawing permafrost and other factors are taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite these increasing risks, only a minority of the models that fed into the UN climate panel’s last major report incorporated the feedback effects of thawing permafrost. And the emissions risks still weren’t fully accounted for because these ecosystems are difficult to monitor and model, Natali says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the complexities: Wildfires, which are themselves hard to predict, can accelerate thawing. It’s also hard to foresee which regions will grow drier or wetter, which determines whether they release mostly methane or carbon dioxide—and those gases have very different warming effects over different time periods. There are counterbalancing effects that must be taken into account as well—for instance, as carbon-absorbing plants replace ice and snow in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natali says improving our understanding of these complex feedback effects is essential to understanding the dangers we face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s going to mean additional costs to human health, human life,” she says. “We want people to be safe—and it’s very hard to do that if you don’t know what’s coming and you’re not prepared for it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

They eventually spotted a clear pattern: &lt;strong&gt;Methane emissions had increased sharply across the tropics, where wetlands were growing wetter and warmer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That created the ideal conditions for microbes that thrive in anaerobic muck, which gobbled up more of the carbon-rich organic matter and spat out more methane as a by-product. (Reduced pollution from nitrogen oxides, which help to break down methane in the atmosphere, also likely played a substantial role.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; offer one of the clearest cases so far where climate change itself is driving additional greenhouse-gas emissions from natural systems&lt;/strong&gt;, triggering a feedback effect that threatens to produce more warming, more emissions, and on and on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are numerous additional ways this is happening or soon could, including wildfires and thawing permafrost. These are major emissions sources that aren’t included in the commitments nations have made under the Paris climate agreement—and climate risks that largely aren’t accounted for in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s most recent warming scenarios.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Spark Climate Solutions (not to be confused with this newsletter) hopes to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The San Francisco nonprofit is launching what’s known as a model intercomparison project,&lt;/strong&gt; in which different research teams run the same set of experiments on different models across a variety of emissions scenarios to determine how climate change could play out. This one would specifically explore how a range of climate feedback effects could propel additional warming, additional emissions, and additional types of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“These increased emissions from natural sources add to human emissions and amplify climate change,” says Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, who previously served as climate science advisor to President Joe Biden. &lt;strong&gt;“And if you don’t look at all of them together, you can’t quantify the strength of that feedback effect.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other participants in the effort will include scientists at the Environmental Defense Fund, Stanford University, the Woodwell Climate Research Center, and other institutions in Europe and Australia, according to Spark Climate Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The nonprofit hopes to publish the findings in time for them to be incorporated into the UN climate panel’s seventh major assessment report, which is just getting underway, to help ensure that these dangers are more fully represented. That, in turn, would give nations a more accurate sense of the world’s carbon budgets, or the quantity of greenhouse gases they can produce before the planet reaches temperatures 1.5 °C or&amp;nbsp; 2 °C over preindustrial levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But one thing is already clear: Since the current scenarios don’t fully account for these feedback effects, the world will almost certainly warm faster than is now forecast&lt;/strong&gt;, which underscores the importance of carrying out this exercise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Scientists at EDF, Woodwell and other institutions found that fires in the world’s northernmost forests, thawing permafrost and warming tropical wetlands could together push the planet beyond 2 °C years faster, eliminating up to a quarter of the time left before the world passes the core goal of the Paris agreement, in a paper under review.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Spark Climate Solutions set up a broader program to advance research and awareness of what’s known as warming-induced emissions, which will launch additional collaborations similar to the modeling intercomparison project.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The goal of the program and the research project is “to really mainstream the inclusion of this topic in climate science and climate policy, and to drive research around climate solutions,” says Ben Poulter, who leads the program at Spark Climate Solutions and was previously a scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Spark notes that warming temperatures could also release more carbon dioxide from the oceans, in a process known as outgassing; additional carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that also depletes the protective ozone layer, from farmland; more carbon dioxide and methane from wildfires; and still more of all three of these gases as permafrost thaws.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ground remains frozen year round across a vast expanse of the Northern Hemisphere, creating a frosty underground storehouse from Alaska to Siberia that’s packed with twice as much carbon as the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But as it thaws, it starts to decompose and release greenhouse gases,&lt;/strong&gt; says Susan Natali, an Arctic climate scientist focused on permafrost at Woodwell. A study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in January noted that 30% of the world’s Arctic–Boreal Zone has already flipped from a carbon sink to a carbon source, when wildfires, thawing permafrost and other factors are taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite these increasing risks, only a minority of the models that fed into the UN climate panel’s last major report incorporated the feedback effects of thawing permafrost. And the emissions risks still weren’t fully accounted for because these ecosystems are difficult to monitor and model, Natali says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the complexities: Wildfires, which are themselves hard to predict, can accelerate thawing. It’s also hard to foresee which regions will grow drier or wetter, which determines whether they release mostly methane or carbon dioxide—and those gases have very different warming effects over different time periods. There are counterbalancing effects that must be taken into account as well—for instance, as carbon-absorbing plants replace ice and snow in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natali says improving our understanding of these complex feedback effects is essential to understanding the dangers we face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s going to mean additional costs to human health, human life,” she says. “We want people to be safe—and it’s very hard to do that if you don’t know what’s coming and you’re not prepared for it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

          &lt;p&gt;By now, you’ve likely heard of fraudulent calls that use AI to clone the voices of people the call recipient knows. Often, the result is what sounds like a grandchild, CEO, or work colleague you’ve known for years reporting an urgent matter requiring immediate action, saying to wire money, divulge login credentials, or visit a malicious website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers and government officials have been warning of the threat for years, with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency saying in 2023 that threats from deepfakes and other forms of synthetic media have increased “exponentially.” Last year, Google’s Mandiant security division reported that such attacks are being executed with “uncanny precision, creating for more realistic phishing schemes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anatomy of a deepfake scam call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, security firm Group-IB outlined the basic steps involved in executing these sorts of attacks. The takeaway is that they’re easy to reproduce at scale and can be challenging to detect or repel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2110493 align-center"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic steps are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting voice samples of the person who will be impersonated.&lt;/b&gt; Samples as short as three seconds are sometimes adequate. They can come from videos, online meetings, or previous voice calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feeding the samples into AI-based speech-synthesis engines&lt;/b&gt;, such as Google’s Tacotron 2, Microsoft’s Vall-E, or services from ElevenLabs and Resemble AI. These engines allow the attacker to use a text-to-speech interface that produces user-chosen words with the voice tone and conversational tics of the person being impersonated. Most services bar such use of deepfakes, but as Consumer Reports found in March, the safeguards these companies have in place to curb the practice could be bypassed with minimal effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An optional step&lt;/b&gt; is to spoof the number belonging to the person or organization being impersonated. These sorts of techniques have been in use for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, attackers &lt;b&gt;initiate the scam call.&lt;/b&gt; In some cases, the cloned voice will follow a script. In other more sophisticated attacks, the faked speech is generated in real time, using voice masking or transformation software. The real-time attacks can be more convincing because they allow the attacker to respond to questions a skeptical recipient may ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although real-time impersonation has been demonstrated by open source projects and commercial APIs, real-time deepfake vishing in-the-wild remains limited,” Group-IB said. “However, given ongoing advancements in processing speed and model efficiency, real-time usage is expected to become more common in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;In either case, the attacker uses the fake voice to generate a pretense for needing the recipient to take immediate action. The narrative might simulate a granddaughter in jail urgently seeking bail money, a CEO directing someone in an accounts payable department to wire money to cover an expense that’s past due, or an IT person instructing an employee to reset a password following a purported breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt; the cash, stolen credential, or other asset. Often, once the action is taken, it's irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shields down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mandiant post showed the relative ease with which members of its security team executed such a scam in a simulated red team exercise, designed to test defenses and train personnel. The red teamers collected publicly available voice samples of someone inside the targeted organization who had employees report to them. The red teamers then used publicly available information to identify employees most likely to work under the person being faked and called them. To make the call more convincing, it used a real outage of a VPN service as a pretense for the employee to take immediate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the trust in the voice on the phone, the victim bypassed security prompts from both Microsoft Edge and Windows Defender SmartScreen, unknowingly downloading and executing a pre-prepared malicious payload onto their workstation,” Mandiant said. “The successful detonation of the payload marked the completion of the exercise, showcasing the alarming ease with which AI voice spoofing can facilitate the breach of an organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precautions for preventing such scams from succeeding can be as simple as parties agreeing to a randomly chosen word or phrase that the caller must provide before the recipient complies with a request. Recipients can also end the call and call the person back at a number known to belong to the caller. But it's best to follow both steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these precautions require the recipient to remain calm and alert, despite the legitimate sense of urgency that would arise if the feigned scenario were real. This can be even harder when the recipient is tired, overextended, or otherwise not at their best. And for that reason, so-called vishing attacks—whether AI-enabled or not—aren’t likely to go away any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;By now, you’ve likely heard of fraudulent calls that use AI to clone the voices of people the call recipient knows. Often, the result is what sounds like a grandchild, CEO, or work colleague you’ve known for years reporting an urgent matter requiring immediate action, saying to wire money, divulge login credentials, or visit a malicious website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers and government officials have been warning of the threat for years, with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency saying in 2023 that threats from deepfakes and other forms of synthetic media have increased “exponentially.” Last year, Google’s Mandiant security division reported that such attacks are being executed with “uncanny precision, creating for more realistic phishing schemes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anatomy of a deepfake scam call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, security firm Group-IB outlined the basic steps involved in executing these sorts of attacks. The takeaway is that they’re easy to reproduce at scale and can be challenging to detect or repel.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic steps are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting voice samples of the person who will be impersonated.&lt;/b&gt; Samples as short as three seconds are sometimes adequate. They can come from videos, online meetings, or previous voice calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feeding the samples into AI-based speech-synthesis engines&lt;/b&gt;, such as Google’s Tacotron 2, Microsoft’s Vall-E, or services from ElevenLabs and Resemble AI. These engines allow the attacker to use a text-to-speech interface that produces user-chosen words with the voice tone and conversational tics of the person being impersonated. Most services bar such use of deepfakes, but as Consumer Reports found in March, the safeguards these companies have in place to curb the practice could be bypassed with minimal effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An optional step&lt;/b&gt; is to spoof the number belonging to the person or organization being impersonated. These sorts of techniques have been in use for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, attackers &lt;b&gt;initiate the scam call.&lt;/b&gt; In some cases, the cloned voice will follow a script. In other more sophisticated attacks, the faked speech is generated in real time, using voice masking or transformation software. The real-time attacks can be more convincing because they allow the attacker to respond to questions a skeptical recipient may ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although real-time impersonation has been demonstrated by open source projects and commercial APIs, real-time deepfake vishing in-the-wild remains limited,” Group-IB said. “However, given ongoing advancements in processing speed and model efficiency, real-time usage is expected to become more common in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;In either case, the attacker uses the fake voice to generate a pretense for needing the recipient to take immediate action. The narrative might simulate a granddaughter in jail urgently seeking bail money, a CEO directing someone in an accounts payable department to wire money to cover an expense that’s past due, or an IT person instructing an employee to reset a password following a purported breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt; the cash, stolen credential, or other asset. Often, once the action is taken, it's irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shields down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mandiant post showed the relative ease with which members of its security team executed such a scam in a simulated red team exercise, designed to test defenses and train personnel. The red teamers collected publicly available voice samples of someone inside the targeted organization who had employees report to them. The red teamers then used publicly available information to identify employees most likely to work under the person being faked and called them. To make the call more convincing, it used a real outage of a VPN service as a pretense for the employee to take immediate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the trust in the voice on the phone, the victim bypassed security prompts from both Microsoft Edge and Windows Defender SmartScreen, unknowingly downloading and executing a pre-prepared malicious payload onto their workstation,” Mandiant said. “The successful detonation of the payload marked the completion of the exercise, showcasing the alarming ease with which AI voice spoofing can facilitate the breach of an organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precautions for preventing such scams from succeeding can be as simple as parties agreeing to a randomly chosen word or phrase that the caller must provide before the recipient complies with a request. Recipients can also end the call and call the person back at a number known to belong to the caller. But it's best to follow both steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these precautions require the recipient to remain calm and alert, despite the legitimate sense of urgency that would arise if the feigned scenario were real. This can be even harder when the recipient is tired, overextended, or otherwise not at their best. And for that reason, so-called vishing attacks—whether AI-enabled or not—aren’t likely to go away any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
