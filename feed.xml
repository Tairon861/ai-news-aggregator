            &lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have developed a printable aluminum alloy that can withstand high temperatures and is five times stronger than traditionally manufactured aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new printable metal is made from a mix of aluminum and other elements that the team identified using a combination of simulations and machine learning, which significantly pruned the number of possible combinations of materials to search through. While traditional methods would require simulating over 1 million possible combinations of materials, the team’s new machine learning-based approach needed only to evaluate 40 possible compositions before identifying an ideal mix for a high-strength, printable aluminum alloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they printed the alloy and tested the resulting material, the team confirmed that, as predicted, the aluminum alloy was as strong as the strongest aluminum alloys that are manufactured today using traditional casting methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;researchers envision that the new printable aluminum could be made into stronger, more lightweight and temperature-resistant products, such as fan blades in jet engines. Fan blades are traditionally&amp;nbsp;cast from titanium — a material that is more than 50 percent heavier and up to 10 times costlier than aluminum — or made from advanced composites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can use lighter, high-strength material, this would save a considerable amount of energy for the transportation industry,” says&amp;nbsp;Mohadeseh Taheri-Mousavi, who led the work as a postdoc at MIT and is now an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because 3D printing can produce complex geometries, save material, and enable unique designs, we see this printable alloy as something that could also be used in advanced vacuum pumps, high-end automobiles, and cooling devices for data centers,” adds John Hart, the Class of 1922 Professor and head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hart and Taheri-Mousavi provide details on the new printable aluminum design in a paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Materials&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s MIT co-authors include Michael Xu, Clay Houser, Shaolou Wei, James LeBeau, and Greg Olson, along with Florian Hengsbach and Mirko Schaper of Paderborn University in Germany, and Zhaoxuan Ge and Benjamin Glaser of Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Micro-sizing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work grew out of an MIT class that Taheri-Mousavi took in 2020, which was taught by Greg Olson, professor of the practice in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. As part of the class, students learned to use computational simulations to design high-performance alloys. Alloys are materials that are made from a mix of different elements, the combination of which imparts exceptional strength and other unique properties to the material as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson challenged the class to design an aluminum alloy that would be stronger than the strongest printable aluminum alloy designed to date. As with most materials, the strength of aluminum depends in large part on its microstructure: The smaller and more densely packed its microscopic constituents, or “precipitates,” the stronger the alloy would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the class used computer simulations to methodically combine aluminum with various types and concentrations of elements, to simulate and predict the resulting alloy’s strength. However, the exercise failed to produce a stronger result. At the end of the class, Taheri-Mousavi wondered: Could machine learning do better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point, there are a lot of things that contribute nonlinearly to a material’s properties, and you are lost,” Taheri-Mousavi says. “With machine-learning tools, they can point you to where you need to focus, and tell you for example, these two elements are controlling this feature. It lets you explore the design space more efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer by layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Taheri-Mousavi continued where Olson’s class left off, this time looking to identify a stronger recipe for aluminum alloy. This time, she used machine-learning techniques designed to efficiently comb through data such as the properties of elements, to identify key connections and correlations that should lead to a more desirable outcome or product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She found that, using just 40 compositions mixing aluminum with different elements, their machine-learning approach quickly homed in on a recipe for an aluminum alloy with higher volume fraction of small precipitates, and therefore higher strength, than what the previous studies identified. The alloy’s strength was even higher than what they could identify after simulating over 1 million possibilities without using machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To physically produce this new strong, small-precipitate alloy, the team realized 3D printing would be the way to go instead of traditional metal casting, in which molten liquid aluminum is poured into a mold and is left to cool and harden. The longer this cooling time is, the more likely the individual precipitate is to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that 3D printing, broadly also known as additive manufacturing, can be a faster way to cool and solidify the aluminum alloy. Specifically, they considered laser bed powder fusion (LBPF) — a technique by which a powder is deposited, layer by layer, on a surface in a desired pattern and then quickly melted by a laser that traces over the pattern. The melted pattern is thin enough that it solidfies quickly before another layer is deposited and similarly “printed.” The team found that LBPF’s inherently rapid cooling and solidification enabled the small-precipitate, high-strength aluminum alloy that their machine learning method predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes we have to think about how to get a material to be compatible with 3D printing,” says study co-author John Hart. “Here, 3D printing opens a new door because of the unique characteristics of the process — particularly, the fast cooling rate. Very rapid freezing of the alloy after it’s melted by the laser creates this special set of properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting their idea into practice, the researchers ordered a formulation of printable powder, based on their new aluminum alloy recipe. They sent the powder — a mix of aluminum and five other elements — to collaborators in Germany, who printed small samples of the alloy using their in-house LPBF system. The samples were then sent to MIT where the team ran multiple tests to measure the alloy’s strength and image the samples’ microstructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results confirmed the predictions made by their initial machine learning search: The printed alloy was five times stronger than a casted counterpart and 50 percent stronger than alloys designed using conventional simulations without machine learning. The new alloy’s microstructure also consisted of a higher volume fraction of small precipitates, and was stable at high temperatures of up to 400 degrees Celsius — a very high temperature for aluminum alloys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are applying similar machine-learning techniques to further optimize other properties of the alloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our methodology opens new doors for anyone who wants to do 3D printing alloy design,” Taheri-Mousavi says. “My dream is that one day, passengers looking out their airplane window will see fan blades of engines made from our aluminum alloys.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tokamaks are machines that are meant to hold and harness the power of the sun. These fusion machines use powerful magnets to contain a plasma hotter than the sun’s core and push the plasma’s atoms to fuse and release energy. If tokamaks can operate safely and efficiently, the machines could one day provide clean and limitless fusion energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there are a number of experimental tokamaks in operation around the world, with more underway. Most are small-scale research machines built to investigate how the devices can spin up plasma and harness its energy. One of the challenges that tokamaks face is how to safely and reliably turn off a plasma current that is circulating at speeds of up to 100 kilometers per second, at temperatures of over 100 million degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such “rampdowns” are necessary when a plasma becomes unstable. To prevent the plasma from further disrupting and potentially damaging the device’s interior, operators ramp down the plasma current. But occasionally the rampdown itself can destabilize the plasma. In some machines, rampdowns have caused scrapes and scarring to the tokamak’s interior — minor damage that still requires considerable time and resources to repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists at MIT have developed a method to predict how plasma in a tokamak will behave during a rampdown. The team combined machine-learning tools with a physics-based model of plasma dynamics to simulate a plasma’s behavior and any instabilities that may arise as the plasma is ramped down and turned off. The researchers trained and tested the new model on plasma data from an experimental tokamak in Switzerland. They found the method quickly learned how plasma would evolve as it was tuned down in different ways. What’s more, the method achieved a high level of accuracy using a relatively small amount of data. This training efficiency is promising, given that each experimental run of a tokamak is expensive and quality data is limited as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model, which the team highlights this week in an open-access &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;paper, could improve the safety and reliability of future fusion power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For fusion to be a useful energy source it’s going to have to be reliable,” says lead author Allen Wang, a graduate student in aeronautics and astronautics and a member of the Disruption Group at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC). “To be reliable, we need to get good at managing our plasmas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s MIT co-authors include PSFC Principal Research Scientist and Disruptions Group leader Cristina Rea, and members of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) Oswin So, Charles Dawson, and Professor Chuchu Fan, along with Mark (Dan) Boyer of Commonwealth Fusion Systems and collaborators from the Swiss Plasma Center in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A delicate balance”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokamaks are experimental fusion devices that were first built in the Soviet Union in the 1950s. The device gets its name from a Russian acronym that translates to a “toroidal chamber with magnetic coils.” Just as its name describes, a tokamak is toroidal, or donut-shaped, and uses powerful magnets to contain and spin up a gas to temperatures and energies high enough that atoms in the resulting plasma can fuse and release energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, tokamak experiments are relatively low-energy in scale, with few approaching the size and output needed to generate safe, reliable, usable energy. Disruptions in experimental, low-energy tokamaks are generally not an issue. But as fusion machines scale up to grid-scale dimensions, controlling much higher-energy plasmas at all phases will be paramount to maintaining a machine’s safe and efficient operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Uncontrolled plasma terminations, even during rampdown, can generate intense heat fluxes damaging the internal walls,” Wang notes. “Quite often, especially with the high-performance plasmas, rampdowns actually can push the plasma closer to some instability limits. So, it’s a delicate balance. And there’s a lot of focus now on how to manage instabilities so that we can routinely and reliably take these plasmas and safely power them down. And there are relatively few studies done on how to do that well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing down the pulse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang and his colleagues developed a model to predict how a plasma will behave during tokamak rampdown. While they could have simply applied machine-learning tools such as a neural network to learn signs of instabilities in plasma data, “you would need an ungodly amount of data” for such tools to discern the very subtle and ephemeral changes in extremely high-temperature, high-energy plasmas, Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers paired a neural network with an existing model that simulates plasma dynamics according to the fundamental rules of physics. With this combination of machine learning and a physics-based plasma simulation, the team found that only a couple hundred pulses at low performance, and a small handful of pulses at high performance, were sufficient to train and validate the new model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data they used for the new study came from the TCV, the Swiss “variable configuration tokamak” operated by the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL (the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne). The TCV is a small experimental fusion experimental device that is used for research purposes, often as test bed for next-generation device solutions. Wang used the data from several hundred TCV plasma pulses that included properties of the plasma such as its temperature and energies during each pulse’s ramp-up, run, and ramp-down. He trained the new model on this data, then tested it and found it was able to accurately predict the plasma’s evolution given the initial conditions of a particular tokamak run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also developed an algorithm to translate the model’s predictions into practical “trajectories,” or plasma-managing instructions that a tokamak controller can automatically carry out to for instance adjust the magnets or temperature maintain the plasma’s stability. They implemented the algorithm on several TCV runs and found that it produced trajectories that safely ramped down a plasma pulse, in some cases faster and without disruptions compared to runs without the new method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point the plasma will always go away, but we call it a disruption when the plasma goes away at high energy. Here, we ramped the energy down to nothing,” Wang notes. “We did it a number of times. And we did things much better across the board. So,&amp;nbsp;we had statistical confidence that we made things better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported in part by Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), an MIT spinout that intends to build the world’s first compact, grid-scale fusion power plant. The company is developing a demo tokamak, SPARC, designed to produce net-energy plasma, meaning that it should generate more energy than it takes to heat up the plasma. Wang and his colleagues are working with CFS on ways that the new prediction model and tools like it can better predict plasma behavior and prevent costly disruptions to enable safe and reliable fusion power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to tackle the science questions to make fusion routinely useful,” Wang says. “What we’ve done here is the start of what is still a long journey. But I think we’ve made some nice progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional support for the research came from the framework of the EUROfusion Consortium, via the Euratom Research and Training Program and funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research, and Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

So,&amp;nbsp;we had statistical confidence that we made things better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported in part by Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), an MIT spinout that intends to build the world’s first compact, grid-scale fusion power plant. The company is developing a demo tokamak, SPARC, designed to produce net-energy plasma, meaning that it should generate more energy than it takes to heat up the plasma. Wang and his colleagues are working with CFS on ways that the new prediction model and tools like it can better predict plasma behavior and prevent costly disruptions to enable safe and reliable fusion power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to tackle the science questions to make fusion routinely useful,” Wang says. “What we’ve done here is the start of what is still a long journey. But I think we’ve made some nice progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional support for the research came from the framework of the EUROfusion Consortium, via the Euratom Research and Training Program and funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research, and Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

The desert sun is blinding as it reflects off the white salt that gathers and crunches underfoot like snow at the water’s edge. In a part of the lake too shallow for boats, bacteria have turned the water a Pepto-Bismol pink. The landscape all around is ringed with jagged red mountains and brown brush. The only obvious sign of people is the salt-encrusted hose running from the water’s edge to a makeshift encampment of shipping containers and trucks a few hundred feet away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This otherworldly scene is the test site for a company called Lilac Solutions, which is developing a technology it says will shake up the United States’ efforts to pry control over the global supply of lithium, the so-called “white gold” needed for electric vehicles and batteries, away from China. Before tearing down its demonstration facility to make way for its first commercial plant, due online next year, the company invited me to be the first journalist to tour its outpost in this remote area, a roughly two-hour drive from Salt Lake City.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The startup is in a race to commercialize a new way to extract lithium from rocks, called direct lithium extraction (DLE). This approach is designed to reduce the environmental damage caused by the two most common traditional methods of mining lithium: hard-rock mining and brining.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Australia, the world’s top producer of lithium, uses the first approach, scraping rocks laden with lithium out of the earth so they can be chemically processed into industrial-grade versions of the metal. Chile, the second-largest lithium source, uses the second: It floods areas of its sun-soaked Atacama Desert with water. This results in ponds rich in dissolved lithium, which are then allowed to dry off, leaving behind lithium salts that can be harvested and processed elsewhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

While DLE has yet to take off, its reduced need for water and land has made it a prime focus for companies and governments looking to ramp up production to meet the growing demand for lithium as electric vehicles take off and even bigger batteries are increasingly used to back up power grids. China, which processes more than two-thirds of the world’s mined lithium, is developing its own DLE to increase domestic production of the raw material. New approaches are still being researched, but nearly a dozen companies are actively looking to commercialize DLE technology now, and some industrial giants already offer basic off-the-shelf hardware.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In August, Lilac completed its most advanced test yet of its technology, which the company says doesn’t just require far less water than traditional lithium extraction—it uses a fraction of what other DLE approaches demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Lilac’s beads are manufactured at the company’s plant in Nevada.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lilac says the beads are particularly well suited to extracting lithium where concentrations are low.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That doesn’t mean they could be deployed just anywhere—there won’t be lithium extraction on the Hudson River anytime soon. But Lilac’s tech could offer significant advantages over what’s currently on the market.

In California’s Salton Sea, developers such as EnergySource Minerals are looking to build a geothermal power plant to power a DLE facility pulling lithium from the inland desert lake. And energy giants such as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum are racing to develop an area in southwestern Arkansas called the Smackover region, where researchers with the US Geological Survey have found as much as 19 million metric tons of untapped lithium in salty underground water. In between, both geographically and strategically, is Lilac: It’s looking to develop new technology like the California companies but sell its hardware to the energy giants in Arkansas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Great Salt Lake isn’t an obvious place to develop a lithium mine. The Salton Sea boasts lithium concentrations of just under 200 parts per million. Argentina, where Lilac has another test facility, has resources of above 700 parts per million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here on the Great Salt Lake? “It’s 70 parts per million,” Raef Sully, Lilac’s Australia-born chief executive, tells me. “So if you had a football stadium with 45,000 seats, this would be three people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Lilac, this is actually a feature of the location. “It’s a very, very good demonstration of the capability of our technology,” Sully says. Showing that Lilac’s hardware can extract lithium at high purity levels from a brine with low concentration, he says, proves its versatility. That wasn’t the reason Lilac selected the site, though. “Utah is a mining friendly state,” says Elizabeth Pond, the vice president of communications. And though the lake water has low concentrations of lithium, extracting the brine simply calls for running a hose into the water, whereas other locations would require digging a well at great cost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;When I accompanied Sully to the test site during my tour, our route following unpaved county roads lined with fields of wild sunflowers. The facility itself is little more than an assortment of converted shipping containers and two mobile trailers, one to serve as the main office and the other as a field laboratory to test samples. It’s off the grid, relying on diesel generators that the company says will be replaced with propane units once this location is converted to a permanent facility but could eventually be swapped for geothermal technology tapping into a hot rock resource located nearby. (Solar panels, Sully clarifies, couldn’t supply the 24-7 power supply the facility will need.) But it depends on its connection to the Great Salt Lake via that lengthy hose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="hand holding a square of wire mesh with a clump of crystals in the center" class="wp-image-1124763" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9054.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Hardened salt and impurities are encrusted on metal mesh that keeps larger materials out of Lilac’s water intake system.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ALEXANDER KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pumped uphill, the lake water passes through a series of filters to remove solids until it ends up in a vessel filled with the company’s specially designed ceramic beads, made from a patented material that attracts lithium ions from the water. Once saturated, the beads are put through an acid wash to remove the lithium. The remaining brine is then repeatedly tested and, once deemed safe to release back into the lake, pumped back down to the shore through an outgoing tube in the hose. The lithium solution, meanwhile, is stockpiled in tanks on site before shipping off to a processing plant to be turned into battery-grade lithium carbonate, which is a white powder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“As a technology provider in the long term, if we’re going to have decades of lithium demand, they want to position their technology as something that can tap a bunch of markets,” McBride says. “To have a technology that can potentially economically recover different types of resources in different types of environments is an enticing proposition.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This testing ground won’t stay this way for long. During my visit, Lilac’s crew was starting to pack up the location after completing its demonstration testing. The results the company shared exclusively with me suggest a smashing success, particularly for such low-grade brine with numerous impurities: Lilac’s equipment recovered 87% of the available lithium, on average, with a purity rate of 99.97%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to clear the area to make way for construction of Lilac’s first permanent commercial facility at the same site. To meet the stipulations of Utah state permits for the new plant, the company had to cease all operations at the demonstration project. If everything goes according to plan, Lilac’s first US facility will begin commercial production in the second half of 2027. The company has lined up about two-thirds of its funding for the project. That could make the plant the first new commercial source of lithium in the US to come online in years, and the first DLE facility ever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once it’s fully online, the project should produce 5,000 tons per year—doubling annual US production of lithium. But a full-scale plant using Lilac’s technology would produce between three and five times that amount.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are some potential snags. Utah regulators this year started cracking down on mineral companies pumping water from the Great Salt Lake, which is shrinking amid worsening droughts. (Lilac says it’s largely immune to the restrictions since it returns the water to the lake.) While the relatively low concentrations of lithium in the water make for a good test case, full-scale commercial production would likely prove far more economical in a place with more of the metal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="sunflowers growing next to a dirt road" class="wp-image-1124766" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9316.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wild sunflowers line the unpaved county roads that cut through ranching land en route to Lilac Solutions’ remote demonstration site.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ALEXANDER KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Great Salt Lake is probably the worst possible place to be doing this, because there are real challenges around pulling water from the lake,” says Ashley Zumwalt-Forbes, a mining engineer who previously served as the deputy director of battery minerals at the Department of Energy. “But if it’s just being used as a trial for the technology, that makes sense.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;What makes Lilac stand out among its peers is that it has no plans to design and manufacture its own DLE equipment and produce actual lithium. Lilac wants instead to sell its technology to others. The pilot plant is just intended to test and debut its hardware. Sully tells me it’s being built under a separate limited-liability corporation to make a potential sale easier if it’s successful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s an unusual play in the lithium industry. Once most companies see success with their technology, “they go crazy and think they can vertically integrate and at the same time be a miner and an energy producer,” Kwasi Ampofo, the head of minerals and metals at the energy consultancy BloombergNEF, tells me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Lilac is trying to be a technology vendor,” he says. “I wonder why a lot more people aren’t choosing that route.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If things work out the right way, Sully says, Lilac could become the vendor of choice to projects like the oil-backed sites in the Smackover and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We think our technology is the next generation,” he says. “And if we end up working with an Exxon or a Chevron or a Rio Tinto, we want to be the DLE technology provider in their lithium project.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;BOX ELDER COUNTY, Utah – On a bright afternoon in August, the shore on the North Arm of the Great Salt Lake looks like something out of a science fiction film set in a scorching alien world.

The results the company shared exclusively with me suggest a smashing success, particularly for such low-grade brine with numerous impurities: Lilac’s equipment recovered 87% of the available lithium, on average, with a purity rate of 99.97%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to clear the area to make way for construction of Lilac’s first permanent commercial facility at the same site. To meet the stipulations of Utah state permits for the new plant, the company had to cease all operations at the demonstration project. If everything goes according to plan, Lilac’s first US facility will begin commercial production in the second half of 2027. The company has lined up about two-thirds of its funding for the project. That could make the plant the first new commercial source of lithium in the US to come online in years, and the first DLE facility ever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once it’s fully online, the project should produce 5,000 tons per year—doubling annual US production of lithium. But a full-scale plant using Lilac’s technology would produce between three and five times that amount.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are some potential snags. Utah regulators this year started cracking down on mineral companies pumping water from the Great Salt Lake, which is shrinking amid worsening droughts. (Lilac says it’s largely immune to the restrictions since it returns the water to the lake.) While the relatively low concentrations of lithium in the water make for a good test case, full-scale commercial production would likely prove far more economical in a place with more of the metal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="sunflowers growing next to a dirt road" class="wp-image-1124766" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9316.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wild sunflowers line the unpaved county roads that cut through ranching land en route to Lilac Solutions’ remote demonstration site.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ALEXANDER KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Great Salt Lake is probably the worst possible place to be doing this, because there are real challenges around pulling water from the lake,” says Ashley Zumwalt-Forbes, a mining engineer who previously served as the deputy director of battery minerals at the Department of Energy. “But if it’s just being used as a trial for the technology, that makes sense.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;What makes Lilac stand out among its peers is that it has no plans to design and manufacture its own DLE equipment and produce actual lithium. Lilac wants instead to sell its technology to others. The pilot plant is just intended to test and debut its hardware. Sully tells me it’s being built under a separate limited-liability corporation to make a potential sale easier if it’s successful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s an unusual play in the lithium industry. Once most companies see success with their technology, “they go crazy and think they can vertically integrate and at the same time be a miner and an energy producer,” Kwasi Ampofo, the head of minerals and metals at the energy consultancy BloombergNEF, tells me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Lilac is trying to be a technology vendor,” he says. “I wonder why a lot more people aren’t choosing that route.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If things work out the right way, Sully says, Lilac could become the vendor of choice to projects like the oil-backed sites in the Smackover and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We think our technology is the next generation,” he says. “And if we end up working with an Exxon or a Chevron or a Rio Tinto, we want to be the DLE technology provider in their lithium project.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/07/1125060/this-company-is-planning-a-lithium-empire-from-the-shores-of-the-great-salt-lake/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] The three big unanswered questions about Sora (Artificial intelligence – MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/07/1124998/the-three-big-unanswered-questions-about-sora/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-171852.png?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week OpenAI released Sora, a TikTok-style app that presents an endless feed of exclusively AI-generated videos, each up to 10 seconds long. The app allows you to create a “cameo” of yourself—a hyperrealistic avatar that mimics your appearance and voice—and insert other peoples’ cameos into your own videos (depending on what permissions they set).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To some people who believed earnestly in OpenAI’s promise to build AI that benefits all of humanity, the app is a punchline. A former OpenAI researcher who left to build an AI-for-science startup referred to Sora as an “infinite AI tiktok slop machine.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That hasn’t stopped it from soaring to the top spot on Apple’s US App Store. After I downloaded the app, I quickly learned what types of videos are, at least currently, performing well: bodycam-style footage of police pulling over pets or various trademarked characters, including SpongeBob and Scooby Doo; deepfake memes of Martin Luther King Jr. talking about Xbox; and endless variations of Jesus Christ navigating our modern world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just as quickly, I had a bunch of questions about what’s coming next for Sora. Here’s what I’ve learned so far.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can it last?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is betting that a sizable number of people will want to spend time on an app in which you can suspend your concerns about whether what you’re looking at is fake and indulge in a stream of raw AI. One reviewer put it this way: “It’s comforting because you know that everything you’re scrolling through isn’t real, where other platforms you sometimes have to guess if it’s real or fake. Here, there is no guessing, it’s all AI, all the time."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This may sound like hell to some. But judging by Sora’s popularity, lots of people want it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So what’s drawing these people in? There are two explanations. One is that Sora is a flash-in-the-pan gimmick, with people lining up to gawk at what cutting-edge AI can create now (in my experience, this is interesting for about five minutes). The second, which OpenAI is betting on, is that we’re witnessing a genuine shift in what type of content can draw eyeballs, and that users will stay with Sora because it allows a level of fantastical creativity not possible in any other app.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are a few decisions down the pike that may shape how many people stick around: how OpenAI decides to implement ads, what limits it sets for copyrighted content (see below), and what algorithms it cooks up to decide who sees what.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can OpenAI afford it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is not profitable, but that’s not particularly strange given how Silicon Valley operates. What is peculiar, though, is that the company is investing in a platform for generating video, which is the most energy-intensive (and therefore expensive) form of AI we have. The energy it takes dwarfs the amount required to create images or answer text questions via ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This isn’t news to OpenAI, which has joined a half-trillion-dollar project to build data centers and new power plants. But Sora—which currently allows you to generate AI videos, for free, without limits—raises the stakes: How much will it cost the company?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is making moves toward monetizing things (you can now buy products directly through ChatGPT, for example). On October 3, its CEO, Sam Altman, wrote in a blog post that “we are going to have to somehow make money for video generation,” but he didn’t get into specifics. One can imagine personalized ads and more in-app purchases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, it’s concerning to imagine the mountain of emissions might result if Sora becomes popular. Altman has accurately described the emissions burden of one query to ChatGPT as impossibly small. What he has not quantified is what that figure is for a 10-second video generated by Sora. It’s only a matter of time until AI and climate researchers start demanding it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many lawsuits are coming?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sora is awash in copyrighted and trademarked characters. It allows you to easily deepfake deceased celebrities. Its videos use copyrighted music.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last week, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported that OpenAI has sent letters to copyright holders notifying them that they’ll have to opt out of the Sora platform if they don’t want their material included, which is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; how these things usually work. The law on how AI companies should handle copyrighted material is far from settled, and it’d be reasonable to expect lawsuits challenging this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;In last week’s blog post, Altman wrote that OpenAI is “hearing from a lot of rightsholders” who want more control over how their characters are used in Sora. He says that the company plans to give those parties more “granular control” over their characters. Still, “there may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But another issue is the ease with which you can use the cameos of real people. People can restrict who can use their cameo, but what limits will there be for what these cameos can be made to do in Sora videos?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is apparently already an issue OpenAI is being forced to respond to. The head of Sora, Bill Peebles, posted on October 5 that users can now restrict how their cameo can be used—preventing it from appearing in political videos or saying certain words, for example. How well will this work? Is it only a matter of time until someone’s cameo is used for something nefarious, explicit, illegal, or at least creepy, sparking a lawsuit alleging that OpenAI is responsible?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Overall, we haven’t seen what full-scale Sora looks like yet (OpenAI is still doling out access to the app via invite codes). When we do, I think it will serve as a grim test: Can AI create videos so fine-tuned for endless engagement that they’ll outcompete “real” videos for our attention? In the end, Sora isn’t just testing OpenAI’s technology—it’s testing us, and how much of our reality we’re willing to trade for an infinite scroll of simulation.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-171852.png?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week OpenAI released Sora, a TikTok-style app that presents an endless feed of exclusively AI-generated videos, each up to 10 seconds long.

IBM&amp;#x27;s announcements represent a three-pronged strategy to address interconnected enterprise AI challenges: modernizing legacy code, governing AI agents in production and bridging the prototype-to-production gap..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company claims 6,000 internal developers within IBM have used Project Bob, achieving an average productivity gain of 45% and a 22-43% increase in code commits .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Project Bob isn&amp;#x27;t another vibe coder, it&amp;#x27;s an enterprise modernization tool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of AI-powered coding tools in the market today, including tools like GitHub Copilot and vibe coding tools such as Replit, Cursor, Bolt and Lovable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Project Bob takes a fundamentally different approach from tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor,&amp;quot;  Bruno Aziza, IBM&amp;#x27;s Vice President of Data, AI and Analytics Strategy told VentureBeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aziza said that Project Bob is enterprise-focused and maintains full-repository context across editing sessions. It automates complex tasks like Java 8 to  more modern version of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to React, Angular or Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architecture orchestrates between Anthropic&amp;#x27;s Claude, Mistral, Meta&amp;#x27;s Llama and IBM&amp;#x27;s recently released&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/western-qwen-ibm-wows-with-granite-4-llm-launch-and-hybrid-mamba-transformer"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Granite 4 models&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;through a data-driven model selection approach. The system routes tasks to whichever LLM is best suited, balancing accuracy, latency and cost in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It understands the entire repository, development intent and security standards, enabling developers to design, debug, refactor and modernize code without breaking flow,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 6,000 early adopters within IBM, 95% used Bob for task completion rather than code generation. The tool integrates DevSecOps practices like vulnerability detection and compliance checks directly into the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bob goes beyond code assistance — it orchestrates intelligence across the entire software development lifecycle, helping teams ship secure, modern software faster,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Project Bob benefits from new Anthropic partnership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of Project Bob is a new partnership between IBM and Anthropic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two vendors announced a partnership to integrate Claude models directly into the watsonx portfolio, starting with Project Bob. The collaboration extends beyond model integration to include what IBM describes as a first-of-its-kind guide for enterprise AI agent deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Anthropic co-created &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/1443d5dd174f42e6"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Guide to Architecting Secure Enterprise AI Agents with MCP Servers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; focused on the Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC). The ADLC framework provides a structured approach to designing, deploying and managing enterprise AI systems. MCP refers to Model Context Protocol, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s widely embraced open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems and data they need to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making it easier to build enterprise-grade AI agents&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Project Bob, IBM announced that it is extending its watsonx Orchestrate technology to integrate the open source Langflow visual agent builder. Langflow is an open-source technology that is led by DataStax, which itself was acquired by IBM in May of this year. The integration of Langflow is intended to address what Aziza calls the &amp;quot;prototype to production chasm.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Today, there&amp;#x27;s no seamless path from open-source prototyping to enterprise-grade systems that are reliable, compliant and scalable,&amp;quot; Aziza said. &amp;quot;Watsonx Orchestrate transforms Langflow-like agentic composition into an enterprise-grade orchestration platform&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;by adding governance, security, scalability, compliance, and operational robustness — making it production-ready for mission-critical use.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aziza explained that the integration of Langflow with watsonx Orchestration brings critical capabilities on top of the open-source tool including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agent lifecycle framework&lt;/b&gt;: Provisioning, versioning, deployment and monitoring with multi-agent coordination and role-based access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integrated AI governance&lt;/b&gt;: Embedded watsonx.governance provides audit trails, explainability for agent decisions, bias and drift monitoring and policy enforcement. Langflow has no native governance controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enterprise infrastructure&lt;/b&gt;: SaaS or on-premises hosting with data isolation, SSO/LDAP integration and fine-grained permissions. Langflow users must manage their own infrastructure and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;No-code and pro-code options&lt;/b&gt;: Langflow is &amp;quot;low-code.&amp;quot; IBM added a visual, no-code Agent Builder and a pro-code Agent Development Kit for seamless promotion from prototype to production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pre-built domain agents&lt;/b&gt;: Catalog of HR, IT and finance agents integrated with Workday, SAP and ServiceNow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Production observability&lt;/b&gt;: Built-in dashboards, analytics and enterprise support SLAs with continuous performance monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AgentOps and Agentic Workflows: From building to governing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is also introducing two new capabilities to watsonx Orchestrate that work in tandem with the Langflow integration: Agentic Workflows for standardized agent coordination and AgentOps for production governance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic Workflows addresses what Aziza calls the &amp;quot;brittle scripts&amp;quot; problem. Today developers build agents using custom scripts that break when scaled across enterprise environments. Agentic Workflows provides standardized, reusable flows that sequence multiple agents and tools consistently. This connects directly to the Langflow integration. While Langflow provides the visual interface for building individual agents, Agentic Workflows handles the orchestration layer, coordinating multiple agents and tools into repeatable enterprise processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AgentOps then provides the governance and observability for those running workflows. The new built-in observability layer provides real-time monitoring and policy-based controls across the full agent lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governance gap becomes concrete in enterprise scenarios. Without AgentOps, an HR onboarding agent might set up benefits and payroll but teams lack visibility into whether it&amp;#x27;s applying policies correctly until problems surface. With AgentOps, every action is monitored in real time, allowing anomalies to be flagged and corrected immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for enterprises&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical debt is something that many organizations struggle with and it can represent a non-trivial barrier for organizations looking to get into agentic AI deployments.

Project Bob&amp;#x27;s value proposition is clearest for organizations with significant legacy Java codebases. The 45% productivity gains IBM measured internally suggest meaningful acceleration for Java 8 to more modern versions of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to modern architectures. However, these metrics come from IBM developers working on IBM systems. The critical unknown is whether the multi-model orchestration delivers the same results on customer codebases with different architectural patterns, technical debt profiles and team skill levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Langflow integration addresses a genuine gap for teams already using open source agent frameworks. The challenge isn&amp;#x27;t building agents with tools like LangChain, LangGraph or n8n. It&amp;#x27;s adding the governance layer, lifecycle management, enterprise security controls and observability required for production deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises looking to lead in AI adoption, IBM&amp;#x27;s announcements serve to reinforce the fact that governance infrastructure is now table stakes&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; You can build agents quickly with existing tools. Scaling them safely requires the lifecycle management, observability and policy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project Bob is now available in private tech preview with broader availability expected in the future. IBM is accepting access requests through its developer portal. Its AgentOps and agentic workflows integrations are now available in watsonx Orchestrate, while its Langflow integration is expected to be generally available at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;For many enterprises, there continue to be barriers to fully adopting and benefiting from agentic AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;IBM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;is betting the blocker isn&amp;#x27;t building AI agents but governing them in production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its TechXchange 2025 conference today, IBM unveiled a series of capabilities designed to bridge the gap: Project Bob, an AI-first IDE that orchestrates multiple LLMs to automate application modernization; AgentOps for real-time agent governance; and the first integration of open-source&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/datastax-acquires-langflow-to-accelerate-enterprise-generative-ai-app-development"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Langflow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/agents-are-key-to-enterprise-ai-success-heres-ibms-plan-on-how-to-make-it-happen"&gt; &lt;u&gt;watsonx Orchestrate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, IBM&amp;#x27;s platform for deploying and managing AI agents. IBM&amp;#x27;s announcements represent a three-pronged strategy to address interconnected enterprise AI challenges: modernizing legacy code, governing AI agents in production and bridging the prototype-to-production gap..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company claims 6,000 internal developers within IBM have used Project Bob, achieving an average productivity gain of 45% and a 22-43% increase in code commits .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Project Bob isn&amp;#x27;t another vibe coder, it&amp;#x27;s an enterprise modernization tool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of AI-powered coding tools in the market today, including tools like GitHub Copilot and vibe coding tools such as Replit, Cursor, Bolt and Lovable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Project Bob takes a fundamentally different approach from tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor,&amp;quot;  Bruno Aziza, IBM&amp;#x27;s Vice President of Data, AI and Analytics Strategy told VentureBeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aziza said that Project Bob is enterprise-focused and maintains full-repository context across editing sessions. It automates complex tasks like Java 8 to  more modern version of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to React, Angular or Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architecture orchestrates between Anthropic&amp;#x27;s Claude, Mistral, Meta&amp;#x27;s Llama and IBM&amp;#x27;s recently released&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/western-qwen-ibm-wows-with-granite-4-llm-launch-and-hybrid-mamba-transformer"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Granite 4 models&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;through a data-driven model selection approach. The system routes tasks to whichever LLM is best suited, balancing accuracy, latency and cost in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It understands the entire repository, development intent and security standards, enabling developers to design, debug, refactor and modernize code without breaking flow,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 6,000 early adopters within IBM, 95% used Bob for task completion rather than code generation. The tool integrates DevSecOps practices like vulnerability detection and compliance checks directly into the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bob goes beyond code assistance — it orchestrates intelligence across the entire software development lifecycle, helping teams ship secure, modern software faster,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Project Bob benefits from new Anthropic partnership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of Project Bob is a new partnership between IBM and Anthropic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two vendors announced a partnership to integrate Claude models directly into the watsonx portfolio, starting with Project Bob. The collaboration extends beyond model integration to include what IBM describes as a first-of-its-kind guide for enterprise AI agent deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Anthropic co-created &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/1443d5dd174f42e6"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Guide to Architecting Secure Enterprise AI Agents with MCP Servers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; focused on the Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC). The ADLC framework provides a structured approach to designing, deploying and managing enterprise AI systems. MCP refers to Model Context Protocol, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s widely embraced open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems and data they need to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making it easier to build enterprise-grade AI agents&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Project Bob, IBM announced that it is extending its watsonx Orchestrate technology to integrate the open source Langflow visual agent builder.

From curated videos on Instagram Reels to booking engines that build entire itineraries in seconds, AI is becoming a powerful force in how journeys are imagined, booked, and lived. But this shift raises an important question: is AI giving travellers more freedom, or quietly steering their choices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fahd Hamidaddin, Founding CEO of the Saudi Tourism Authority and President of the upcoming TOURISE Summit, believes AI can do both, speaking to &lt;em&gt;AI News&lt;/em&gt;. In a wide-ranging conversation, he explained how AI is transforming travel discovery, personalisation, cultural exchange, and ethics—and why the industry must set clear guardrails as technology takes on a more active role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-as-a-travel-companion"&gt;AI as a travel companion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is changing how people discover destinations. Instead of generic travel lists, platforms now serve content that feels personal. “AI has turned travel discovery into a personal canvas,” Hamidaddin said. “Platforms like Instagram Reels no longer just show ‘where to go’; they curate journeys that feel tailor-made for each traveller.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-109759" height="760" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FH_official_029f060b07.avif" width="785" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Fahd Hamidaddin, Founding CEO of the Saudi Tourism Authority and President of the upcoming TOURISE Summit&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift is not just about convenience. By highlighting lesser-known destinations, AI can spread demand and ease pressure on crowded tourist spots. It can also introduce travellers to authentic local experiences that might otherwise remain hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamidaddin sees the next phase as “agentic AI”—technology that doesn’t just make suggestions but takes action. He described a future where AI automatically rebooks flights disrupted by weather, adjusts itineraries, and reschedules reservations in real time. “That’s frictionless travel—where the logistics fade and the adventure takes centre stage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-personalisation-vs-algorithmic-influence-in-travel"&gt;AI personalisation vs. algorithmic influence in travel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-driven booking engines promise hyper-personalised recommendations, matching experiences to individual interests and budgets. This can make planning smoother and more inspiring, but it also comes with risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They do both,” Hamidaddin said when asked whether AI empowers travellers or guides them without their knowledge. “AI can empower travellers like never before—matching experiences to passions, budgets, and even moods. But unchecked, algorithms can quietly narrow horizons, nudging people toward predictable options. This risk only increases with agentic AI, which will make decisions on travellers’ behalf. That’s why transparency and accountability are non-negotiable. AI should be a compass, not a cage, and travellers must always hold the final word.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trust-and-transparency"&gt;Trust and transparency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balance between personalisation and privacy will shape the next era of travel. As AI systems collect vast amounts of personal data, travellers are more aware of how their preferences, clicks, and searches are used. Hamidaddin stressed that trust is the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The era of hyper-personalisation must be built on trust. Travellers know their data is powerful, and they’re right to ask how it’s being used,” he said. The solution, in his view, is “radical transparency: explicit consent, clear explanations, and real opt-in choices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI, which can act on a traveller’s behalf, makes this even more important. If algorithms are booking, adjusting, or cancelling plans automatically, travellers need clear ways to control and understand these actions. “True innovation doesn’t just customise the journey; it safeguards the traveller’s confidence and autonomy,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-setting-standards-through-tourise"&gt;Setting standards through TOURISE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamidaddin will lead discussions on these topics at the inaugural TOURISE Summit in Riyadh this November. He sees the summit as a chance to shape global standards for AI use in travel, not just showcase technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The TOURISE is designed to be more than an event—it’s the world’s first platform where government, business, and technology leaders unite to shape travel tech responsibly,” he said. His goals include creating a shared ethical framework for AI, encouraging partnerships to address privacy and workforce challenges, promoting sustainability, and training the global tourism workforce to thrive in an AI-driven industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TOURISE must set a new benchmark: innovation with integrity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cultural-exchange-and-economic-growth"&gt;Cultural exchange and economic growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI’s influence goes beyond logistics. It is also changing cultural exchange and economic development, particularly in Saudi Arabia. “AI is dissolving barriers—linguistic, cultural, and economic. It’s curating authentic connections that go beyond sightseeing into meaningful exchange,” Hamidaddin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained how Saudi Arabia is using AI to highlight cultural and historical treasures like AlUla and Diriyah, while supporting artisans, festivals, and small businesses. Agentic AI will help create smoother travel experiences that allow visitors to focus more on culture and less on planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t just about more visitors; it’s about inclusive growth, mutual respect, and shared prosperity,” he said. By 2030, AI is expected to contribute $135 billion to Saudi Arabia’s GDP, with tourism playing a central role. But for Hamidaddin, the real impact is measured in “bonds between people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ethical-guardrails-for-ai-in-travel"&gt;Ethical guardrails for AI in travel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI systems take on more responsibility, clear ethical standards become essential. Hamidaddin outlined several priorities: making AI usage clear to users, regularly auditing algorithms for bias, giving travellers control over their data, and designing systems that promote cultural diversity and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With agentic AI, the stakes rise: when an AI acts on a traveller’s behalf, we must ensure transparency, explainability, and accountability. Agency must never replace autonomy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-innovation-with-ethics"&gt;Innovation with ethics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate isn’t about whether to adopt AI, but how to do so responsibly. Hamidaddin argues that innovation should align with human values and environmental priorities. “It’s not about chasing every shiny new tool; it’s about aligning innovation with human values and planetary needs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes governments, businesses, communities, and travellers must collaborate to agree on shared principles. Agentic AI makes this even more urgent, as decisions may increasingly be made by machines. “Our job is to ensure technology serves people, not the other way around,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-era-for-travel"&gt;A new era for travel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamidaddin is optimistic about what lies ahead. “What excites me most is that travel is becoming transformative again,” he said. He imagines a future where language barriers disappear, itineraries adapt in real time, and every trip supports local communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Saudi Arabia, platforms like “Spirit of Saudi” are already using AI to showcase authentic experiences, from desert adventures to artisan workshops. The next step is agentic journeys, where AI travel companions handle logistics seamlessly, freeing travellers to focus on discovery and connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At TOURISE, I believe we’re not simply shaping tourism’s future—we’re igniting a new era of connection and shared prosperity across the globe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by S O C I A L .

Agentic AI will help create smoother travel experiences that allow visitors to focus more on culture and less on planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t just about more visitors; it’s about inclusive growth, mutual respect, and shared prosperity,” he said. By 2030, AI is expected to contribute $135 billion to Saudi Arabia’s GDP, with tourism playing a central role. But for Hamidaddin, the real impact is measured in “bonds between people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ethical-guardrails-for-ai-in-travel"&gt;Ethical guardrails for AI in travel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI systems take on more responsibility, clear ethical standards become essential. Hamidaddin outlined several priorities: making AI usage clear to users, regularly auditing algorithms for bias, giving travellers control over their data, and designing systems that promote cultural diversity and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With agentic AI, the stakes rise: when an AI acts on a traveller’s behalf, we must ensure transparency, explainability, and accountability. Agency must never replace autonomy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-innovation-with-ethics"&gt;Innovation with ethics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate isn’t about whether to adopt AI, but how to do so responsibly. Hamidaddin argues that innovation should align with human values and environmental priorities. “It’s not about chasing every shiny new tool; it’s about aligning innovation with human values and planetary needs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes governments, businesses, communities, and travellers must collaborate to agree on shared principles. Agentic AI makes this even more urgent, as decisions may increasingly be made by machines. “Our job is to ensure technology serves people, not the other way around,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-era-for-travel"&gt;A new era for travel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamidaddin is optimistic about what lies ahead. “What excites me most is that travel is becoming transformative again,” he said. He imagines a future where language barriers disappear, itineraries adapt in real time, and every trip supports local communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Saudi Arabia, platforms like “Spirit of Saudi” are already using AI to showcase authentic experiences, from desert adventures to artisan workshops. The next step is agentic journeys, where AI travel companions handle logistics seamlessly, freeing travellers to focus on discovery and connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At TOURISE, I believe we’re not simply shaping tourism’s future—we’re igniting a new era of connection and shared prosperity across the globe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by S O C I A L .

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The three big unanswered questions about Sora&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Last week OpenAI released Sora, a TikTok-style app that presents an endless feed of exclusively AI-generated videos, each up to 10 seconds long. The app allows you to create a “cameo” of yourself—a hyperrealistic avatar that mimics your appearance and voice—and insert other peoples’ cameos into your own videos (depending on what permissions they set).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the days since, it soared to the top spot on Apple’s US App Store.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armstrong, who previously advised Musk during the Twitter deal, will oversee the finances of both xAI and X, which were merged in April, the report said. The former banker has been working with xAI for several weeks and was only recently appointed as CFO, the FT added.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI has been without a CFO since its previous finance head, Mike Liberatore, left the company in July, and Armstrong’s appointment follows a slate of high-profile executive departures at both xAI and X. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI’s general counsel, Robert Keele, left the company in August after a little more than a year on the job. Raghu Rao, a senior lawyer, also departed around the same time, and Igor Babuschkin, one of xAI’s co-founders, in August said he was leaving the company to launch his own VC firm dedicated to AI safety research. Linda Yaccarino, former CEO of X, also resigned in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armstrong will take over from X’s current CFO, Mahmoud Reza Banki, who is leaving the company, the FT reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2207699717.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, now has a new chief financial officer: Former Morgan Stanley banker Anthony Armstrong, the Financial Times reported, citing anonymous sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armstrong, who previously advised Musk during the Twitter deal, will oversee the finances of both xAI and X, which were merged in April, the report said. The former banker has been working with xAI for several weeks and was only recently appointed as CFO, the FT added.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI has been without a CFO since its previous finance head, Mike Liberatore, left the company in July, and Armstrong’s appointment follows a slate of high-profile executive departures at both xAI and X. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI’s general counsel, Robert Keele, left the company in August after a little more than a year on the job. Raghu Rao, a senior lawyer, also departed around the same time, and Igor Babuschkin, one of xAI’s co-founders, in August said he was leaving the company to launch his own VC firm dedicated to AI safety research. Linda Yaccarino, former CEO of X, also resigned in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armstrong will take over from X’s current CFO, Mahmoud Reza Banki, who is leaving the company, the FT reported.&lt;/p&gt;
