You can read more from the series here&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In mid-October, a mysterious object cracked the windshield of a packed Boeing 737 cruising at 36,000 feet above Utah, forcing the pilots into an emergency landing. The internet was suddenly buzzing with the prospect that the plane had been hit by a piece of space debris. We still don’t know exactly what hit the plane—likely a remnant of a weather balloon—but it turns out the speculation online wasn’t that far-fetched.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s because while the risk of flights being hit by space junk is still small, it is, in fact, growing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;About three pieces of old space equipment—used rockets and defunct satellites—fall into Earth’s atmosphere every day, according to estimates by the European Space Agency. By the mid-2030s, there may be dozens. The increase is linked to the growth in the number of satellites in orbit. Currently, around 12,900 active satellites circle the planet. In a decade, there may be 100,000 of them, according to analyst estimates.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To minimize the risk of orbital collisions, operators guide old satellites to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. But the physics of that reentry process are not well understood, and we don’t know how much material burns up and how much reaches the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The number of such landfall events is increasing,” says Richard Ocaya, a professor of physics at the University of Free State in South Africa and a coauthor of a recent paper on space debris risk. “We expect it may be increasing exponentially in the next few years.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So far, space debris hasn’t injured anybody—in the air or on the ground. But multiple close calls have been reported in recent years. In March last year, an 0.7-kilogram chunk of metal pierced the roof of a house in Florida. The object was later confirmed to be a remnant of a battery pallet tossed out from the International Space Station. When the strike occurred, the homeowner’s 19-year-old son was resting in a next-door room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And in February this year, a 1.5-meter-long fragment of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket crashed down near a warehouse outside Poland’s fifth-largest city, Poznan. Another piece was found in a nearby forest. A month later, a 2.5-kilogram piece of a Starlink satellite dropped on a farm in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Other incidents have been reported in Australia and Africa. And many more may be going completely unnoticed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you were to find a bunch of burnt electronics in a forest somewhere, your first thought is not that it came from a spaceship,” says James Beck, the director of the UK-based space engineering research firm Belstead Research. He warns that we don’t fully understand the risk of space debris strikes and that it might be much higher than satellite operators want us to believe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, SpaceX, the owner of the currently largest mega-constellation, Starlink, claims that its satellites are “designed for demise” and completely burn up when they spiral from orbit and fall through the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Beck, who has performed multiple wind tunnel tests using satellite mock-ups to mimic atmospheric forces, says the results of such experiments raise doubts. Some satellite components are made of durable materials such as titanium and special alloy composites that don’t melt even at the extremely high temperatures that arise during a hypersonic atmospheric descent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We have done some work for some small-satellite manufacturers and basically, their major problem is that the tanks get down,” Beck says. “For larger satellites, around 800 kilos, we would expect maybe two or three objects to land.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to quantify how much of a danger space debris poses. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that “the rapid growth in satellite deployments presents a novel challenge” for aviation safety, one that “cannot be quantified with the same precision as more established hazards.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the Federal Aviation Administration has calculated some preliminary numbers on the risk to flights: In a 2023 analysis, the agency estimated that by 2035, the risk that one plane per year will experience a disastrous space debris strike will be around 7 in 10,000. Such a collision would either destroy the aircraft immediately or lead to a rapid loss of air pressure, threatening the lives of all on board.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The casualty risk to humans on the ground will be much higher. Aaron Boley, an associate professor in astronomy and a space debris researcher at the University of British Columbia, Canada, says that if megaconstellation satellites “don’t demise entirely,” the risk of a single human death or injury caused by a space debris strike on the ground could reach around 10% per year by 2035. That would mean a better than even chance that someone on Earth would be hit by space junk about every decade. In its report, the FAA put the chances even higher with similar assumptions, estimating that “one person on the planet would be expected to be injured or killed every two years.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts are starting to think about how they might incorporate space debris into their air safety processes. The German space situational awareness company Okapi Orbits, for example, in cooperation with the German Aerospace Center and the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol), is exploring ways to adapt air traffic control systems so that pilots and air traffic controllers can receive timely and accurate alerts about space debris threats.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But predicting the path of space debris is challenging too. In recent years, advances in AI have helped improve predictions of space objects’ trajectories in the vacuum of space, potentially reducing the risk of orbital collisions. But so far, these algorithms can’t properly account for the effects of the gradually thickening atmosphere that space junk encounters during reentry. Radar and telescope observations can help, but the exact location of the impact becomes clear with only very short notice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Even with high-fidelity models, there’s so many variables at play that having a very accurate reentry location is difficult,” says Njord Eggen, a data analyst at Okapi Orbits. Space debris goes around the planet every hour and a half when in low Earth orbit, he notes, “so even if you have uncertainties on the order of 10 minutes, that’s going to have drastic consequences when it comes to the location where it could impact.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For aviation companies, the problem is not just a potential strike, as catastrophic as that would be. To avoid accidents, authorities are likely to temporarily close the airspace in at-risk regions, which creates delays and costs money. Boley and his colleagues published a paper earlier this year estimating that busy aerospace regions such as northern Europe or the northeastern United States already have about a 26% yearly chance of experiencing at least one disruption due to the reentry of a major space debris item. By the time all planned constellations are fully deployed, aerospace closures due to space debris hazards may become nearly as common as those due to bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because current reentry predictions are unreliable, many of these closures may end up being unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, when a 21-metric-ton Chinese Long March mega-rocket was falling to Earth in 2022, predictions suggested its debris could scatter across Spain and parts of France. In the end, the rocket crashed into the Pacific Ocean. But the 30-minute closure of south European airspace delayed and diverted hundreds of flights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, international regulators are urging satellite operators and launch providers to deorbit large satellites and rocket bodies in a controlled way, when possible, by carefully guiding them into remote parts of the ocean using residual fuel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The European Space Agency estimates that only about half the rocket bodies reentering the atmosphere do so in a controlled way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, around 2,300 old and no-longer-controllable rocket bodies still linger in orbit, slowly spiraling toward Earth with no mechanisms for operators to safely guide them into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s enough material up there that even if we change our practices, we will still have all those rocket bodies eventually reenter,” Boley says. “Although the probability of space debris hitting an aircraft is small, the probability that the debris will spread and fall over busy airspace is not small. That’s actually quite likely.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/plane-debris.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next.

That’s actually quite likely.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/17/1127980/what-is-the-chance-your-plane-will-be-hit-by-space-debris/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Sakana AI raises $135M Series B at a $2.65B valuation to continue building AI models for Japan (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/sakana-ai-raises-135m-series-b-at-a-2-65b-valuation-to-continue-building-ai-models-for-japan/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sakana-AI-.png?w=808" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As U.S. giants like Google, OpenAI and Anthropic race to develop the large language models that underpin their AI products, startups such as Sakana AI, Mistral AI, DeepSeek and AI21 Labs are carving out their own niche with specialized models designed for specific regions, industries, or unique features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In pursuit of that goal, Tokyo-based Sakana AI has closed a ¥20 billion (approximately $135 million) Series B funding round, which values the company at $2.65 billion post-money, up from a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion, CEO David Ha told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2023 by former Google researchers Llion Jones, Ren Ito and Ha, Sakana AI makes affordable generative AI models that work well with small datasets and are optimized for the Japanese language and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Series B round drew a mix of new and returning investors, combining Japan’s financial heavyweights like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) with global venture players such as Khosla Ventures, Macquarie Capital, NEA, Lux Capital and In-Q-Tel (IQT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We plan to deploy the new capital for not only R&amp;amp;D, including [AI] model development, but also to expand our workforce for engineering, sales, and distribution teams in Japan,” Ha said. This year, Sakana has expanded its presence in Japan, teaming up with leading local enterprises, including Daiwa and MUFG, and developing AI solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ha, who previously led research at Stability AI and worked at Google and Goldman Sachs, also said Sakana plans to expand its enterprise business beyond finance into the industrial, manufacturing, and government sectors in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Looking ahead, the company is eyeing the defense, intelligence and manufacturing sectors. The two-year-old startup also said it will be “actively pursuing strategic investment, partnerships and M&amp;amp;A for long-term global growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This funding round comes roughly a year after the company’s Series A round, in which it raised about ¥30 billion ($214 million) at a $1.5 billion valuation.

Seoul is also accelerating investment in advanced weapons systems and expanding its defense ties, particularly with Europe. With the new EU-South Korea Security and Defence Partnership in 2024 and growing exports of vehicles and artillery, the country has become the second-largest arms supplier to European NATO members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yet despite that enormous industrial footprint, remarkably few startups have emerged to match or challenge the incumbents. The country’s defense-tech startup scene is still nascent, exposing a wide gap between Korea’s manufacturing strength and its early-stage innovation.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bone AI, a new startup based in Seoul and Palo Alto, California, launched earlier this year with an ambitious plan to build a fully unified AI platform that ties together software, hardware, and manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company develops next-generation autonomous air (UAVs), ground (UGVs), and marine (USVs) vehicles for defense and government clients, focusing largely on B2G contracts. While it ultimately aims to operate all three types of systems, Bone is starting with its defense-focused aerial drones, which are designed to streamline missions such as logistics support, wildfire detection, and anti-drone defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company, founded by DK Lee (who also co-founded MarqVision), has raised a $12 seed round led by Third Prime with participation from Kolon Group, a South Korean strategic investor that has expertise in developing advanced materials and manufacturing. Kolon is an ideal strategic partner for Bone, which operates across AI, robotics, and next-generation manufacturing, Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup is already generating revenue, landing a seven-figure B2G contract and pulling in $3 million in its first year of operation, Lee noted. In addition, Bone has been selected as a winner in a South Korean government-backed end-to-end logistics program that will deploy UAVs and UGVs powered by its autonomy stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When asked how a company less than a year old is already securing contracts and generating revenue, Lee told TechCrunch that Bone acquired a South Korean drone company called D-Makers, and its intellectual property&amp;nbsp;(IP), just six months after launch. Originally focused on AI models for robotics, Bone is now integrating its existing AI division with the newly acquired company, and more acquisitions are on the horizon, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lee personally committed more than 10% of the round, approximately $1.5 million, he told TechCrunch. “That was important to me because I wanted to show both investors and my team that I’m fully invested, financially and emotionally, in this mission,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bone is Lee’s second venture. His experience co-founding MarqVision gave him firsthand insight into building and scaling AI products worldwide, but it also convinced him that the next frontier of AI isn’t just digital; it’s physical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“After leaving MarqVision, I basically started from zero — going to robotics conferences like IEEE ICRA, cold-emailing the engineers behind Google RT-1/RT-2, and even walking up to Jim Keller, CEO of Tenstorrent, at a cafe just to introduce myself and grab a coffee later,” Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bone AI shouldn’t be pigeonholed as just a defense tech company, the founder continued. With broader ambitions, Lee frames it as a “physical AI” firm, bringing together advanced AI simulation, autonomy algorithms, embedded engineering, hardware design, and large-scale manufacturing under one roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While preparing his second company, Lee observed that AI and hardware were advancing in silos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“No one was building the connective tissue, the industrial backbone that allows intelligent machines to exist at scale. Even Nvidia, the most valuable AI company today, relies on a vast ecosystem of fabrication and manufacturing partners across Asia and Europe,” he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lee points to South Korea’s track record of building global hardware manufacturing powerhouses like Hyundai, Samsung, and LG. “This is why we should see more drone and small-robotics companies emerging here, and why Korea is fully capable of supporting them,” the CEO said. “Our mission at Bone is to build the supply chain for physical AI within South Korea, and then expand that capability to the U.S., Europe, and other allied countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anduril has become a household name in the U.S., boasting a valuation north of $30 billion, while in Europe, Helsing last raised funding at around $13 billion. Even in smaller markets like Israel, companies such as Kela Technologies have achieved similar recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Asia has yet to see the same level of adoption, Michael Kim, general partner at Third Prime, told TechCrunch. “As economies around the world focus on reindustrialization, not just the U.S., Bone sits at the intersection of sovereign AI, multipolarity, and reindustrialization,” he said, highlighting both the company’s mission and the problem it aims to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;South Korea has high-quality, cost-competitive hardware manufacturing across multiple sectors such as heavy industry, shipbuilding, cars, and semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Many niche hardware players exist but haven’t received Bay Area VC funding; Bone has a strong ‘buy versus build strategy’ to acquire and integrate these assets, accelerating product maturity and commercial traction,” Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DK_InLex-5.png?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;South Korea’s major defense giants have amassed roughly $69 billion in order backlogs as of late 2024, according to media reports.

The revised app replaces the older Tongyi version and became available on both major app stores on Friday, last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its app-store descriptions, Alibaba calls Qwen the “most powerful official AI assistant for its models” and the main way for users to try its newest Qwen model. The company also plans to add agent-style features that can help shoppers on platforms such as Taobao, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba has spent the past two years trying to expand the use of its Qwen models during the global rush toward AI tools. Along with newer Chinese players like DeepSeek and Moonshot AI, Alibaba has become one of the country’s bigger AI developers. It has also supported an open-source approach by making its models available for others to use and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba has been trying to turn these models into steady revenue, and the push appears to be paying off. In the June quarter, sales from its AI products grew at triple-digit rates for the eighth quarter in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Alibaba cut the cost of using Qwen3-Max, its largest model, by almost half, according to the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;. The trillion-parameter system launched in September with some of the highest prices on Alibaba Cloud. The company has now reduced its lowest API rates from US$0.861 to US$0.459 per million input tokens and from US$3.441 to US$1.836 per million output tokens. Users who run batch tasks during off-peak hours get another 50 per cent discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model recently placed first in a cryptocurrency investment contest that compared top models from both the US and China. Its price drop comes amid sharper competition in China’s model market. Several start-ups — including Moonshot AI, Zhipu AI, and MiniMax — have released new systems in recent months and have promoted their performance and low costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has already seen several rounds of price cuts across the AI sector. There have been earlier battles between major model developers, followed by new competition in areas such as coding tools. This week, Volcano Engine, the cloud unit of ByteDance, introduced a new coding agent for 9.90 yuan (US$1.30) for the first month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies have also tried new ways to attract customers. Last week on Tuesday, Moonshot AI — which Alibaba backs — rolled out an offer that lets new users try its Kimi K2 Thinking model for as little as 0.99 yuan. People were encouraged to negotiate their own discount with the Kimi chatbot, which led some users to share “prompt injection” tips online, including messages that tricked the system into thinking they worked for Moonshot. Within hours, the company said the chatbot had started “hallucinating,” and engineers were called to fix the issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s fast progress in AI has also been noticed in the United States. “Silicon Valley doesn’t want to admit it, but the symptoms are obvious: we’re witnessing a full-blown Qwen panic,” marketing specialist Tulsi Soni wrote on social media on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Alibaba had to defend itself against claims reported by the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;. The report said a White House memo alleged Alibaba had provided China’s People’s Liberation Army with certain technical support, including access to some customer data such as IP addresses, Wi-Fi details, payment information, and AI services. The memo also claimed that Alibaba staff had passed along information about “zero-day” security flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FT said it could not confirm the memo on its own but said the claims pointed to rising concern in Washington about the risks tied to Chinese cloud and AI providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba rejected the allegations, saying they were “completely false” and questioning the motives behind the leak. A spokesperson described the report as a “malicious PR operation” meant to weaken a recent trade deal between the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the US criticised the FT’s reporting as well, calling the accusations “groundless” and a distortion of facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by zhang hui)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Alibaba’s new Qwen model to supercharge AI transcription tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110571" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-5.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The revised app replaces the older Tongyi version and became available on both major app stores on Friday, last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its app-store descriptions, Alibaba calls Qwen the “most powerful official AI assistant for its models” and the main way for users to try its newest Qwen model. The company also plans to add agent-style features that can help shoppers on platforms such as Taobao, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba has spent the past two years trying to expand the use of its Qwen models during the global rush toward AI tools. Along with newer Chinese players like DeepSeek and Moonshot AI, Alibaba has become one of the country’s bigger AI developers. It has also supported an open-source approach by making its models available for others to use and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba has been trying to turn these models into steady revenue, and the push appears to be paying off. In the June quarter, sales from its AI products grew at triple-digit rates for the eighth quarter in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Alibaba cut the cost of using Qwen3-Max, its largest model, by almost half, according to the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;. The trillion-parameter system launched in September with some of the highest prices on Alibaba Cloud. The company has now reduced its lowest API rates from US$0.861 to US$0.459 per million input tokens and from US$3.441 to US$1.836 per million output tokens. Users who run batch tasks during off-peak hours get another 50 per cent discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model recently placed first in a cryptocurrency investment contest that compared top models from both the US and China. Its price drop comes amid sharper competition in China’s model market. Several start-ups — including Moonshot AI, Zhipu AI, and MiniMax — have released new systems in recent months and have promoted their performance and low costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has already seen several rounds of price cuts across the AI sector. There have been earlier battles between major model developers, followed by new competition in areas such as coding tools. This week, Volcano Engine, the cloud unit of ByteDance, introduced a new coding agent for 9.90 yuan (US$1.30) for the first month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies have also tried new ways to attract customers. Last week on Tuesday, Moonshot AI — which Alibaba backs — rolled out an offer that lets new users try its Kimi K2 Thinking model for as little as 0.99 yuan. People were encouraged to negotiate their own discount with the Kimi chatbot, which led some users to share “prompt injection” tips online, including messages that tricked the system into thinking they worked for Moonshot. Within hours, the company said the chatbot had started “hallucinating,” and engineers were called to fix the issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s fast progress in AI has also been noticed in the United States. “Silicon Valley doesn’t want to admit it, but the symptoms are obvious: we’re witnessing a full-blown Qwen panic,” marketing specialist Tulsi Soni wrote on social media on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Alibaba had to defend itself against claims reported by the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;. The report said a White House memo alleged Alibaba had provided China’s People’s Liberation Army with certain technical support, including access to some customer data such as IP addresses, Wi-Fi details, payment information, and AI services. The memo also claimed that Alibaba staff had passed along information about “zero-day” security flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FT said it could not confirm the memo on its own but said the claims pointed to rising concern in Washington about the risks tied to Chinese cloud and AI providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba rejected the allegations, saying they were “completely false” and questioning the motives behind the leak.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was created by third-time founder Andrew Berman (previous companies: baby-monitor maker Nanit and an AI video conferencing tool, Vowel, that sold to Zapier in 2024).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the four months since Runlayer launched its product in stealth, it has signed dozens of customers, including eight unicorns or public companies like Gusto, dbt Labs, Instacart, and Opendoor, it says.&amp;nbsp;It also nabbed David Soria Parra, the lead creator of MCP, as an angel and advisor, Berman tells TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;(Parra did not respond to our request for comment.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Parra’s team at Anthropic launched the protocol in November 2024 as an open source project. MCP has since become the de facto standard for allowing AI agents to connect with the data and systems they need to work independently. It allows agents to access data, move it, alter it, and execute business processes without human oversight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The protocol is now supported by every major model maker including OpenAI, Microsoft, AWS, and Google, as well as thousands of tech and enterprise companies; just to name a few: Atlassian, Asana, Stripe, Block, and others ranging from banks to consumer goods manufacturers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Everyone talks about AI,” Berman, Runlayer’s CEO, told TechCrunch, “but AI is really only as useful as the tools and the resources it has access to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The problem is, the MCP protocol itself doesn’t include much security out of the box, so many MCP implementations have already been found to be vulnerable in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The poster children are probably GitHub and Asana. In May, researchers at Invariant Labs discovered a prompt injection vulnerability in MCP servers that allowed them to grab data from private GitHub repositories (ones that shouldn’t have been accessible to the public).&amp;nbsp;Asana discovered and fixed a vulnerability in its MCP server in June that could have exposed customer data. There have since been many more types of attacks found to work on common MCP server setups.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As you might expect, such security issues have given rise to numerous MCP security products, including products from big-name companies like Cloudflare, Docker, and Wiz — as well as a host of startups tackling more specific products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The most common type of MCP security product these days is a gateway, essentially a security layer for identifying the agents and controlling their access to apps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Runlayer plans to stand out in this crowded market by being an all-in-one security tool that combines a gateway with features like threat detection that analyzes every MCP request; observability that watched all agentic activity across all MCP servers that IT has permitted; enterprise development where IT can build custom AI automations for enterprise users; and detailed permissions that work with existing identity providers like Okta and Entra.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other competitors, such as open source Obot, Runlayer business users are presented with an Okta-like catalog of the pre-vetted MCP servers that their IT will allow agents to access.&amp;nbsp;Runlayer matches the agents’ app permissions to the human users’ permissions. For instance, some people might have read-only access to financial systems, some write access (the ability to change the data). Others have no access at all.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Berman believes Runlayer stands out from the crowd, not just with the breadth of the product, but because of the team’s experience. He founded the startup because, after selling Vowel to Zapier, he became the director of Zapier’s AI, and built one of the first MCP servers, working closely at the time with OpenAI and Anthropic, he said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What are the problems that we saw with the protocol? One, it was the security risk because it was adopted so quickly,” he said. There were “blind spots” in areas like observability and audits, that make it risky for enterprises to roll out to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So in August, “we left our jobs. We signed up David Soria Parra, the creator of the spec, and in four months, we’ve signed up eight unicorns,” he said of himself and his co-founders from Zapier Tal Peretz and Vitor Balocco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other advisors and investors in the company, Berman says, include head of security at Cursor Travis McPeak, and founder of Neon Nikita Shamgunov.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Runlayer-Team.jpg?resize=1200,686" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Monday, a new Model Context Protocol security startup called Runlayer launched out of stealth with $11 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures’ Keith Rabois and Felicis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was created by third-time founder Andrew Berman (previous companies: baby-monitor maker Nanit and an AI video conferencing tool, Vowel, that sold to Zapier in 2024).&lt;/p&gt;

While he was working on making the best chips he could, the more important bottleneck was in software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You can make the best hardware on earth, but if it’s hard for developers to use, they’re just not going to use it,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, he’s started a company that focuses entirely on that problem. On Monday, Luminal announced $5.3 million in seed funding, in a round led by Felicis Ventures with angel investment from Paul Graham, Guillermo Rauch, and Ben Porterfield.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fioti’s co-founders, Jake Stevens and Matthew Gunton, come from Apple and Amazon, respectively, and the company was part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2025 batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Luminal’s core business is simple: The company sells compute, just like neo-cloud companies like CoreWeave or Lambda Labs. But where those companies focus on GPUs, Luminal has focused on optimization techniques that let the company squeeze more compute out of the infrastructure it has. In particular, the company focuses on optimizing the compiler that sits between written code and the GPU hardware — the same developer systems that caused Fioti so many headaches in his previous job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the moment, the industry’s leading compiler is Nvidia’s CUDA system — an underrated element in the company’s runaway success. But many elements of CUDA are open source, and Luminal is betting that, with many in the industry still scrambling for GPUs, there will be a lot of value to be gained in building out the rest of the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s part of a growing cohort of inference-optimization startups, which have grown more valuable as companies look for faster and cheaper ways to run their models. Inference providers like BaseTen and Together AI have long specialized in optimization, and smaller companies like Tensormesh and Clarifai are now popping up to focus on more specific technical tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Luminal and other members of the cohort will face stiff competition from optimization teams at major labs, which have the benefit of optimizing for a single family of models. Working for clients, Luminal has to adapt to whatever model comes their way. But even with the risk of being out-gunned by the hyperscalers, Fioti says the market is growing fast enough that he’s not worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It is always going to be possible to spend six months hand tuning a model architecture on a given hardware, and you’re probably going to beat any sorts of, any sort of compiler performance,” Fioti says. “But our big bet is that anything short of that, the all-purpose use case is still very economically valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Studio-Session-71723.jpeg?resize=800,1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Three years ago, Luminal co-founder Joe Fioti was working on chip design at Intel when he came to a realization.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bezos will share the position with Vik Bajaj, who previously led and co-founded Google’s life sciences division. Bajaj also co-founded Verily, a biotech startup owned by Alphabet, and is the co-founder of Foresite Labs, an AI-focused affiliate of investment firm Foresite Capital, though the report notes he recently left the firm to start Prometheus, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bezos would be returning to operations for the first time since he stepped away from Amazon in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to the NYT, the startup is going to build AI products for engineering and manufacturing in various fields like computers, aerospace, and automobiles. Project Prometheus is focused on “AI for the physical economy,” per its LinkedIn page, and the report noted that its work will resemble that of Periodic Labs, which is building technology to speed up scientific research by simulating the physical world to train AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

That means the large language models underpinning AI products today need even more data centers to be trained and for inferencing, and therefore, they need more power. Against that backdrop, energy efficiency has suddenly become a critical priority for semiconductor manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PowerLattice, a startup founded by veteran electrical engineers from Qualcomm, NUVIA, and Intel in 2023, claims to have developed a groundbreaking approach that reduces the power needs of computer chips by more than 50%. On Monday, the startup emerged from stealth with a $25 million Series A funding round led by Playground Global and Celesta Capital, bringing its total funding to $31 million.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is the hard stuff: How do you get power into the device? There are very few teams and people that can do it,” said Pat Gelsinger, general partner at Playground Global. “We have assembled what I’d argue is the dream team of power delivery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As the former CEO of Intel, Gelsinger carries significant authority in the semiconductor world, which makes his participation a powerful stamp of approval for PowerLattice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, when the startup’s CEO Dr. Peng Zou and its founding team pitched their idea at Playground’s offices in March, they were so star-struck by Gelsinger’s fame that they asked him for a selfie, Gelsinger told TechCrunch. The admiration proved mutual, as Gelsinger came away genuinely impressed with PowerLattice’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup’s tech sounds simple in concept: a tiny power delivery chiplet that’s designed to bring power closer to the processor, significantly minimizing energy loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Two years in, PowerLattice has already achieved its first key milestone: Its first batch of chiplets is being produced by TSMC, in partnership with an unnamed manufacturer that is testing the startup’s functionality, Gelsinger said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond its initial customer, the startup plans to make its product available for testing by other customers in the first half of 2026. The trials should prove instructive, given that PowerLattice’s potential customer set includes major chip manufacturers Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, as well as specialized AI chip developers, such as Cerberus, Grok, and Playground-backed startups d-Matrix and NextSilicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although every chip company has internal teams working on improving energy efficiency, Gelsinger hopes that PowerLattice’s innovative approach will pique their interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“They may say, ‘I’m going to take some volume to this approach, some volume to my more traditional approach’,” he said. “But we think our ability to capture meaningful share will quickly emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PowerLattice is not the only startup attempting to help chip manufacturers address the energy problem. The company would compete most closely with Empower Semiconductor, a startup that raised a $140 million Series D, led by Fidelity Management &amp;amp; Research Company, in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Gelsinger is certain that PowerLattice’s 50% energy efficiency gain is an “extraordinary” result, and he expects the company to soon raise a much larger funding round to fund production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The idea is bold, the benefits are large, and I expect others will be saying, ‘That’s a great idea. Let me try as well,’” Gelsinger said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Chiplet-on-finger-for-scale.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;If you pay attention to what the biggest tech companies are saying about AI demand, you’ll notice a common thread: they’re running short of compute capacity.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, when the startup’s CEO Dr. Peng Zou and its founding team pitched their idea at Playground’s offices in March, they were so star-struck by Gelsinger’s fame that they asked him for a selfie, Gelsinger told TechCrunch. The admiration proved mutual, as Gelsinger came away genuinely impressed with PowerLattice’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup’s tech sounds simple in concept: a tiny power delivery chiplet that’s designed to bring power closer to the processor, significantly minimizing energy loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Two years in, PowerLattice has already achieved its first key milestone: Its first batch of chiplets is being produced by TSMC, in partnership with an unnamed manufacturer that is testing the startup’s functionality, Gelsinger said.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond its initial customer, the startup plans to make its product available for testing by other customers in the first half of 2026. The trials should prove instructive, given that PowerLattice’s potential customer set includes major chip manufacturers Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, as well as specialized AI chip developers, such as Cerberus, Grok, and Playground-backed startups d-Matrix and NextSilicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although every chip company has internal teams working on improving energy efficiency, Gelsinger hopes that PowerLattice’s innovative approach will pique their interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“They may say, ‘I’m going to take some volume to this approach, some volume to my more traditional approach’,” he said. “But we think our ability to capture meaningful share will quickly emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PowerLattice is not the only startup attempting to help chip manufacturers address the energy problem. The company would compete most closely with Empower Semiconductor, a startup that raised a $140 million Series D, led by Fidelity Management &amp;amp; Research Company, in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Gelsinger is certain that PowerLattice’s 50% energy efficiency gain is an “extraordinary” result, and he expects the company to soon raise a much larger funding round to fund production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The idea is bold, the benefits are large, and I expect others will be saying, ‘That’s a great idea. Let me try as well,’” Gelsinger said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/powerlattice-attracts-investment-from-ex-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-for-its-power-saving-chiplet/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:08:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Quantitative finance experts believe graduates ill-equipped for AI future (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/quantitative-finance-experts-believe-graduates-ill-equipped-for-ai-future/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;New insight from the CQF Institute, a worldwide network for quantitative finance professionals (quants), reveals that fewer than one in ten specialists believe new graduates possess the AI and machine learning skills necessary to succeed in the industry.

I’ve seen too many internal security audits flag third-party AI services as exposure points. Granting third-party AI agents access to proprietary bidstream data introduces unnecessary exposure that many organisations are no longer willing to accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why many teams shift to embedded AI agents: local models that operate entirely in your environment. No data leaves your perimeter. No blind spots in the audit trail. You retain full control over how models behave – and more importantly, what they see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-risks-associated-with-external-ai-use"&gt;Risks associated with external AI use&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time performance or user-level data leaves your infrastructure for inference, you introduce risk. Not theoretical – operational. In recent security audits, we’ve seen cases where external AI vendors log request-level signals under the pretext of optimisation. That includes proprietary bid strategies, contextual targeting signals, and in some cases, metadata with identifiable traces. The isn’t just a privacy concern – it’s a loss of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public bid requests are one thing. However, any performance data, tuning variables, and internal outcomes you share is proprietary data. Sharing it with third-party models, especially those hosted in extra-EEA cloud environments, creates gaps in both visibility and compliance. Under regulations like GDPR and CPRA/CCPA, even “pseudonymous” data can trigger legal exposure if transferred improperly or used beyond its declared purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a model hosted on an external endpoint receives a call to assess a bid opportunity. Alongside the call, payloads may include price floors, win/loss outcomes, or tuning variables. The values, often embedded in headers or JSON payloads, may be logged for debugging or model improvement and retained beyond a single session, depending on vendor policy. Black-box AI models compound the issue. When vendors don’t disclose inference logic or model behaviour, you’re left without the ability to audit, debug, or even explain how decisions are made. That’s a liability – both technically and legally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-local-ai-a-strategic-shift-for-programmatic-control"&gt;Local AI: A strategic shift for programmatic control&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift toward local AI is not merely a defensive move to address privacy regulations – it is an opportunity to redesign how data workflows and decisioning logic are controlled in programmatic platforms. Embedded inference keeps both input and output logic fully controlled – something centralised AI models take away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-control-over-data"&gt;Control over data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owning the stack means having full control over the data workflow – from deciding which bidstream fields are exposed to models, to setting TTL for training datasets, and defining retention or deletion rules. The enables teams to run AI models without external constraints and experiment with advanced setups tailored to specific business needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a DSP can restrict sensitive geolocation data while still using generalized insights for campaign optimisation. Selective control is harder to guarantee once data leaves the platform’s boundary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-auditable-model-behaviour"&gt;Auditable model behaviour&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;External AI models often offer limited visibility into how bidding decisions are made. Using a local model allows organisations to audit their behaviour, test its accuracy against their own KPIs, and fine-tune its parameters to meet specific yield, pacing, or performance targets. The level of auditability strengthens trust in the supply chain. Publishers can verify and demonstrate that inventory enrichment follows consistent, verifiable standards. The gives buyers higher confidence in inventory quality, reduces spend on invalid traffic, and minimises fraud exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alignment with data privacy requirements&lt;br /&gt;Local inference keeps all data in your infrastructure, under your governance. That control is essential for complying with any local laws and privacy requirements in regions. Signals like IP addresses or device IDs can be processed on-site, without ever leaving your environment – reducing exposure while preserving signal quality &lt;strong&gt;with appropriate legal basis and safeguards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-applications-of-local-ai-in-programmatic"&gt;Practical applications of local AI in programmatic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to protecting bidstream data, local AI improves decisioning efficiency and quality in the programmatic chain without increasing data exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bidstream enrichment&lt;br /&gt;Local AI can classify page or app taxonomy, analyse referrer signals, and enrich bid requests with contextual metadata in real time. For example, models can calculate visit frequency or recency scores and pass them as additional request parameters for DSP optimisation. The accelerates decision latency and improves contextual accuracy – without exposing raw user data to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pricing-optimisation"&gt;Pricing optimisation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since ad tech is dynamic, pricing models must continuously adapt to short-term shifts in demand and supply. Rule-based approaches often react more slowly to changes compared to ML-driven repricing models. Local AI can detect emerging traffic patterns and adjust the bid floor or dynamic price recommendations accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fraud-detection"&gt;Fraud detection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local AI detects anomalies pre-auction – like randomized IP pools, suspicious user agent patterns, or sudden deviations in win rate – and flags them for mitigation. For example, it can flag mismatches between request volume and impression rate, or abrupt win-rate drops inconsistent with supply or demand shifts.The does not replace dedicated fraud scanners, but augments them with local anomaly detection and monitoring, without requiring external data sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The are just a few of the most visible applications – local AI also enables tasks like signals deduplication, ID bridging, frequency modeling, inventory quality scoring, and supply path analysis, all benefiting from secure, real-time execution at the edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-control-and-performance-with-local-ai"&gt;Balancing control and performance with local AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running AI models in your own infrastructure ensures privacy and governance without sacrificing optimisation potential. local AI moves decision-making closer to the data layer, making it auditable, region-compliant, and fully under platform control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitive advantage isn’t about the fastest models, but about models that balance speed with data stewardship and transparency.

Granting third-party AI agents access to proprietary bidstream data introduces unnecessary exposure that many organisations are no longer willing to accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why many teams shift to embedded AI agents: local models that operate entirely in your environment. No data leaves your perimeter. No blind spots in the audit trail. You retain full control over how models behave – and more importantly, what they see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-risks-associated-with-external-ai-use"&gt;Risks associated with external AI use&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time performance or user-level data leaves your infrastructure for inference, you introduce risk. Not theoretical – operational. In recent security audits, we’ve seen cases where external AI vendors log request-level signals under the pretext of optimisation. That includes proprietary bid strategies, contextual targeting signals, and in some cases, metadata with identifiable traces. The isn’t just a privacy concern – it’s a loss of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public bid requests are one thing. However, any performance data, tuning variables, and internal outcomes you share is proprietary data. Sharing it with third-party models, especially those hosted in extra-EEA cloud environments, creates gaps in both visibility and compliance. Under regulations like GDPR and CPRA/CCPA, even “pseudonymous” data can trigger legal exposure if transferred improperly or used beyond its declared purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a model hosted on an external endpoint receives a call to assess a bid opportunity. Alongside the call, payloads may include price floors, win/loss outcomes, or tuning variables. The values, often embedded in headers or JSON payloads, may be logged for debugging or model improvement and retained beyond a single session, depending on vendor policy. Black-box AI models compound the issue. When vendors don’t disclose inference logic or model behaviour, you’re left without the ability to audit, debug, or even explain how decisions are made. That’s a liability – both technically and legally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-local-ai-a-strategic-shift-for-programmatic-control"&gt;Local AI: A strategic shift for programmatic control&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift toward local AI is not merely a defensive move to address privacy regulations – it is an opportunity to redesign how data workflows and decisioning logic are controlled in programmatic platforms. Embedded inference keeps both input and output logic fully controlled – something centralised AI models take away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-control-over-data"&gt;Control over data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owning the stack means having full control over the data workflow – from deciding which bidstream fields are exposed to models, to setting TTL for training datasets, and defining retention or deletion rules. The enables teams to run AI models without external constraints and experiment with advanced setups tailored to specific business needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a DSP can restrict sensitive geolocation data while still using generalized insights for campaign optimisation. Selective control is harder to guarantee once data leaves the platform’s boundary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-auditable-model-behaviour"&gt;Auditable model behaviour&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;External AI models often offer limited visibility into how bidding decisions are made. Using a local model allows organisations to audit their behaviour, test its accuracy against their own KPIs, and fine-tune its parameters to meet specific yield, pacing, or performance targets. The level of auditability strengthens trust in the supply chain. Publishers can verify and demonstrate that inventory enrichment follows consistent, verifiable standards. The gives buyers higher confidence in inventory quality, reduces spend on invalid traffic, and minimises fraud exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alignment with data privacy requirements&lt;br /&gt;Local inference keeps all data in your infrastructure, under your governance. That control is essential for complying with any local laws and privacy requirements in regions. Signals like IP addresses or device IDs can be processed on-site, without ever leaving your environment – reducing exposure while preserving signal quality &lt;strong&gt;with appropriate legal basis and safeguards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-applications-of-local-ai-in-programmatic"&gt;Practical applications of local AI in programmatic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to protecting bidstream data, local AI improves decisioning efficiency and quality in the programmatic chain without increasing data exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bidstream enrichment&lt;br /&gt;Local AI can classify page or app taxonomy, analyse referrer signals, and enrich bid requests with contextual metadata in real time. For example, models can calculate visit frequency or recency scores and pass them as additional request parameters for DSP optimisation. The accelerates decision latency and improves contextual accuracy – without exposing raw user data to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pricing-optimisation"&gt;Pricing optimisation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since ad tech is dynamic, pricing models must continuously adapt to short-term shifts in demand and supply. Rule-based approaches often react more slowly to changes compared to ML-driven repricing models. Local AI can detect emerging traffic patterns and adjust the bid floor or dynamic price recommendations accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fraud-detection"&gt;Fraud detection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local AI detects anomalies pre-auction – like randomized IP pools, suspicious user agent patterns, or sudden deviations in win rate – and flags them for mitigation. For example, it can flag mismatches between request volume and impression rate, or abrupt win-rate drops inconsistent with supply or demand shifts.The does not replace dedicated fraud scanners, but augments them with local anomaly detection and monitoring, without requiring external data sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The are just a few of the most visible applications – local AI also enables tasks like signals deduplication, ID bridging, frequency modeling, inventory quality scoring, and supply path analysis, all benefiting from secure, real-time execution at the edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-control-and-performance-with-local-ai"&gt;Balancing control and performance with local AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running AI models in your own infrastructure ensures privacy and governance without sacrificing optimisation potential. local AI moves decision-making closer to the data layer, making it auditable, region-compliant, and fully under platform control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitive advantage isn’t about the fastest models, but about models that balance speed with data stewardship and transparency.

Every Monday, writers from both publications debate one aspect of the generative AI revolution reshaping global power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this conversation, Helen Warrell, &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; investigations reporter and former defense and security editor, and James O’Donnell, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s senior AI reporter, consider the ethical quandaries and financial incentives around AI’s use by the military.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127512" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MITTR_FT_small.png?w=1135" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helen Warrell, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; investigations reporter&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is July 2027, and China is on the brink of invading Taiwan. Autonomous drones with AI targeting capabilities are primed to overpower the island’s air defenses as a series of crippling AI-generated cyberattacks cut off energy supplies and key communications. In the meantime, a vast disinformation campaign enacted by an AI-powered pro-Chinese meme farm spreads across global social media, deadening the outcry at Beijing’s act of aggression.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Scenarios such as this have brought dystopian horror to the debate about the use of AI in warfare. Military commanders hope for a digitally enhanced force that is faster and more accurate than human-directed combat. But there are fears that as AI assumes an increasingly central role, these same commanders will lose control of a conflict that escalates too quickly and lacks ethical or legal oversight. Henry Kissinger, the former US secretary of state, spent his final years warning about the coming catastrophe of AI-driven warfare.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Grasping and mitigating these risks is the military priority—some would say the “Oppenheimer moment”—of our age. One emerging consensus in the West is that decisions around the deployment of nuclear weapons should not be outsourced to AI. UN secretary-general António Guterres has gone further, calling for an outright ban on fully autonomous lethal weapons systems. It is essential that regulation keep pace with evolving technology. But in the sci-fi-fueled excitement, it is easy to lose track of what is actually possible. As researchers at Harvard’s Belfer Center point out, AI optimists often underestimate the challenges of fielding fully autonomous weapon systems. It is entirely possible that the capabilities of AI in combat are being overhyped.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Anthony King, Director of the Strategy and Security Institute at the University of Exeter and a key proponent of this argument, suggests that rather than replacing humans, AI will be used to improve military insight. Even if the character of war is changing and remote technology is refining weapon systems, he insists, “the complete automation of war itself is simply an illusion.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of the three current military use cases of AI, none involves full autonomy. It is being developed for planning and logistics, cyber warfare (in sabotage, espionage, hacking, and information operations; and—most controversially—for weapons targeting, an application already in use on the battlefields of Ukraine and Gaza. Kyiv’s troops use AI software to direct drones able to evade Russian jammers as they close in on sensitive sites. The Israel Defense Forces have developed an AI-assisted decision support system known as Lavender, which has helped identify around 37,000 potential human targets within Gaza.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Helen Warrell and James O'Donnell" class="wp-image-1126829" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FT_TR_Newsletter-Episode-03.jpg?w=2731" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;FT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | ADOBE STOCK&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is clearly a danger that the Lavender database replicates the biases of the data it is trained on. But military personnel carry biases too. One Israeli intelligence officer who used Lavender claimed to have more faith in the fairness of a “statistical mechanism” than that of a grieving soldier.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tech optimists designing AI weapons even deny that specific new controls are needed to control their capabilities. Keith Dear, a former UK military officer who now runs the strategic forecasting company Cassi AI, says existing laws are more than sufficient: “You make sure there’s nothing in the training data that might cause the system to go rogue … when you are confident you deploy it—and you, the human commander, are responsible for anything they might do that goes wrong.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an intriguing thought that some of the fear and shock about use of AI in war may come from those who are unfamiliar with brutal but realistic military norms. What do you think, James? Is some opposition to AI in warfare less about the use of autonomous systems and really an argument against war itself?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James O’Donnell replies: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hi Helen,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve noticed is that there’s been a drastic shift in attitudes of AI companies regarding military applications of their products. In the beginning of 2024, OpenAI unambiguously forbade the use of its tools for warfare, but by the end of the year, it had signed an agreement with Anduril to help it take down drones on the battlefield.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;This step—not a fully autonomous weapon, to be sure, but very much a battlefield application of AI—marked a drastic change in how much tech companies could publicly link themselves with defense.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What happened along the way? For one thing, it’s the hype. We’re told AI will not just bring superintelligence and scientific discovery but also make warfare sharper, more accurate and calculated, less prone to human fallibility. I spoke with US Marines, for example, who tested a type of AI while patrolling the South Pacific that was advertised to analyze foreign intelligence faster than a human could.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secondly, money talks. OpenAI and others need to start recouping some of the unimaginable amounts of cash they’re spending on training and running these models. And few have deeper pockets than the Pentagon. And Europe’s defense heads seem keen to splash the cash too. Meanwhile, the amount of venture capital funding for defense tech this year has already doubled the total for all of 2024, as VCs hope to cash in on militaries’ newfound willingness to buy from startups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I do think the opposition to AI warfare falls into a few camps, one of which simply rejects the idea that more precise targeting (if it’s &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;more precise at all) will mean fewer casualties rather than just more war. Consider the first era of drone warfare in Afghanistan. As drone strikes became cheaper to implement, can we really say it reduced carnage? Instead, did it merely enable more destruction per dollar?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the second camp of criticism (and now I’m finally getting to your question) comes from people who are well versed in the realities of war but have very specific complaints about the technology’s fundamental limitations. Missy Cummings, for example, is a former fighter pilot for the US Navy who is now a professor of engineering and computer science at George Mason University. She has been outspoken in her belief that large language models, specifically, are prone to make huge mistakes in military settings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The typical response to this complaint is that AI’s outputs are human-checked. But if an AI model relies on thousands of inputs for its conclusion, can that conclusion really be checked by one person?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tech companies are making extraordinarily big promises about what AI can do in these high-stakes applications, all while pressure to implement them is sky high. For me, this means it’s time for more skepticism, not less.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helen responds:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Hi James,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We should definitely continue to question the safety of AI warfare systems and the oversight to which they’re subjected—and hold political leaders to account in this area. I am suggesting that we also apply some skepticism to what you rightly describe as the “extraordinarily big promises” made by some companies about what AI might be able to achieve on the battlefield.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There will be both opportunities and hazards in what the military is being offered by a relatively nascent (though booming) defense tech scene. The danger is that in the speed and secrecy of an arms race in AI weapons, these emerging capabilities may not receive the scrutiny and debate they desperately need.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further reading:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome back to &lt;em&gt;The State of AI&lt;/em&gt;, a new collaboration between the Financial Times and MIT Technology Review.

Consider the first era of drone warfare in Afghanistan. As drone strikes became cheaper to implement, can we really say it reduced carnage? Instead, did it merely enable more destruction per dollar?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the second camp of criticism (and now I’m finally getting to your question) comes from people who are well versed in the realities of war but have very specific complaints about the technology’s fundamental limitations. Missy Cummings, for example, is a former fighter pilot for the US Navy who is now a professor of engineering and computer science at George Mason University. She has been outspoken in her belief that large language models, specifically, are prone to make huge mistakes in military settings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The typical response to this complaint is that AI’s outputs are human-checked. But if an AI model relies on thousands of inputs for its conclusion, can that conclusion really be checked by one person?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tech companies are making extraordinarily big promises about what AI can do in these high-stakes applications, all while pressure to implement them is sky high. For me, this means it’s time for more skepticism, not less.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helen responds:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Hi James,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We should definitely continue to question the safety of AI warfare systems and the oversight to which they’re subjected—and hold political leaders to account in this area. I am suggesting that we also apply some skepticism to what you rightly describe as the “extraordinarily big promises” made by some companies about what AI might be able to achieve on the battlefield.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There will be both opportunities and hazards in what the military is being offered by a relatively nascent (though booming) defense tech scene. The danger is that in the speed and secrecy of an arms race in AI weapons, these emerging capabilities may not receive the scrutiny and debate they desperately need.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further reading:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/17/1127514/the-state-of-ai-the-new-rules-of-war/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Oracle hit hard in Wall Street’s tech sell-off over its huge AI bet (AI – Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/11/oracle-hit-hard-in-wall-streets-tech-sell-off-over-its-huge-ai-bet/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Oracle has been hit harder than Big Tech rivals in the recent sell-off of tech stocks and bonds, as its vast borrowing to fund a pivot to artificial intelligence unnerved Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US software group founded by Larry Ellison has made a dramatic entrance to the AI race, committing to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in the next few years on chips and data centers—largely as part of deals to supply computing capacity to OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed and scale of its moves have unsettled some investors at a time when markets are keenly focused on the spending of so-called hyperscalers—big tech companies building vast data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle shares are down 25 percent in the past month, nearly twice the fall of the next worst-performing hyperscaler, Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slide has reversed more than $250 billion of gains in its market value when the Texas-based group disclosed its deals with OpenAI in September. A Financial Times index tracking the price of Oracle’s debt has fallen about 6 percent since mid-September, significantly worse than any of its major peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle has prompted particular concern because the group shifted from business software to cloud computing later than its rivals. Its strategy has become more focused on an all-out bet on AI, pinned largely to the success of OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a completely different business model to what investors prize in cloud services,” said Alex Haissl at Rothschild &amp;amp; Co Redburn. “The deals look fantastic when you look at the revenue figures, but they are very capital-intensive so create very little value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are concerned about lofty valuations and huge capital expenditure by a few large tech groups that could backfire if a handful of lossmaking AI start-ups such as OpenAI and Anthropic fail to deliver on their promises for the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle shares fell 4.2 percent on Thursday as the NASDAQ tumbled 2.3 percent—the latest in a series of sell-offs led by tech stocks. The stock recovered some of those losses on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2127786 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="fullwidth full" height="2153" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/oracle-ft-chart1.png" width="1455" /&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2127785 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="fullwidth full" height="2153" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/oracle-ft-chart-2.png" width="1455" /&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle has said its deals with OpenAI would generate $300 billion of revenue between 2027 and 2032.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its executives say the rewards will justify the risks due to intense and accelerating AI demand, which far exceeds existing supplies of computing power. Its shares are still up 30 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle’s infrastructure business is forecast to increase revenues by more than 10 times by 2029, according to estimates compiled by S&amp;amp;P Visible Alpha. And the bulk of Wall Street analysts are bullish on its stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Oracle has been aggressive in tapping debt markets to rapidly build its capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group has about $96 billion of long-term debt, up from $75 billion a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. Morgan Stanley forecasts this will soar to about $290 billion by 2028. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September and is in talks to raise $38 billion in debt financing through a number of US banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellison “is now way off the reservation in terms of how he’s spending,” said a short seller who has long tracked Oracle’s stock but does not have an active bet against it. “The market is clearly saying it is no longer interested in companies burning endless cash on AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays analysts this week downgraded their rating of Oracle’s debt from market neutral to underweight, warning that its large expenses on AI infrastructure had outpaced its free cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit rating agency Moody’s has also flagged up significant risks due to Oracle relying on a small number of AI companies. S&amp;amp;P Global warned that a third of Oracle’s revenues will be tied to a single customer by 2028, referring to its reliance on OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“That is a huge liability and credit risk for Oracle. Your main customer, biggest customer by far, is a venture capital-funded start-up,” said Andrew Chang, a director at S&amp;amp;P Global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI faces questions about how it plans to meet its commitments to spend $1.4 trillion on AI infrastructure over the next eight years. It has struck deals with several Big Tech groups, including Oracle’s rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2127784 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="fullwidth full" height="1050" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hyperscalers-ft-chart.png" width="1450" /&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the five hyperscalers—which include Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta—Oracle is the only one with negative free cash flow. Its debt-to-equity ratio has surged to 500 percent, far higher than Amazon’s 50 percent and Microsoft’s 30 percent, according to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all five companies have seen their cash-to-assets ratios decline significantly in recent years amid a boom in spending, Oracle’s is by far the lowest, JPMorgan found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analysts noted a “tension between [Oracle’s] aggressive AI build-out ambitions and the limits of its investment-grade balance sheet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts have also noted that Oracle’s data center leases are for much longer than its contracts to sell capacity to OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle has signed at least five long-term lease agreements for US data centers that will ultimately be used by OpenAI, resulting in $100 billion of off-balance-sheet lease commitments. The sites are at varying levels of construction, with some not expected to break ground until next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safra Catz, Oracle’s sole chief executive from 2019 until she stepped down in September, resisted expanding its cloud business because of the vast expenses required. She was replaced by co-CEOs Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as part of the pivot by Oracle to a new era focused on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catz, who is now executive vice-chair of Oracle’s board, has exercised stock options and sold $2.5 billion of its shares this year, according to US regulatory filings. She had announced plans to exercise her stock options at the end of 2024.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle shares fell 4.2 percent on Thursday as the NASDAQ tumbled 2.3 percent—the latest in a series of sell-offs led by tech stocks. The stock recovered some of those losses on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2127786 align-fullwidth"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2127785 align-fullwidth"&gt;

                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="fullwidth full" height="2153" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/oracle-ft-chart-2.png" width="1455" /&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle has said its deals with OpenAI would generate $300 billion of revenue between 2027 and 2032.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its executives say the rewards will justify the risks due to intense and accelerating AI demand, which far exceeds existing supplies of computing power. Its shares are still up 30 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle’s infrastructure business is forecast to increase revenues by more than 10 times by 2029, according to estimates compiled by S&amp;amp;P Visible Alpha. And the bulk of Wall Street analysts are bullish on its stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Oracle has been aggressive in tapping debt markets to rapidly build its capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group has about $96 billion of long-term debt, up from $75 billion a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. Morgan Stanley forecasts this will soar to about $290 billion by 2028. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September and is in talks to raise $38 billion in debt financing through a number of US banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellison “is now way off the reservation in terms of how he’s spending,” said a short seller who has long tracked Oracle’s stock but does not have an active bet against it. “The market is clearly saying it is no longer interested in companies burning endless cash on AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays analysts this week downgraded their rating of Oracle’s debt from market neutral to underweight, warning that its large expenses on AI infrastructure had outpaced its free cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit rating agency Moody’s has also flagged up significant risks due to Oracle relying on a small number of AI companies. S&amp;amp;P Global warned that a third of Oracle’s revenues will be tied to a single customer by 2028, referring to its reliance on OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“That is a huge liability and credit risk for Oracle. Your main customer, biggest customer by far, is a venture capital-funded start-up,” said Andrew Chang, a director at S&amp;amp;P Global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI faces questions about how it plans to meet its commitments to spend $1.4 trillion on AI infrastructure over the next eight years. It has struck deals with several Big Tech groups, including Oracle’s rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2127784 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="fullwidth full" height="1050" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hyperscalers-ft-chart.png" width="1450" /&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the five hyperscalers—which include Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta—Oracle is the only one with negative free cash flow. Its debt-to-equity ratio has surged to 500 percent, far higher than Amazon’s 50 percent and Microsoft’s 30 percent, according to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all five companies have seen their cash-to-assets ratios decline significantly in recent years amid a boom in spending, Oracle’s is by far the lowest, JPMorgan found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analysts noted a “tension between [Oracle’s] aggressive AI build-out ambitions and the limits of its investment-grade balance sheet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts have also noted that Oracle’s data center leases are for much longer than its contracts to sell capacity to OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle has signed at least five long-term lease agreements for US data centers that will ultimately be used by OpenAI, resulting in $100 billion of off-balance-sheet lease commitments. The sites are at varying levels of construction, with some not expected to break ground until next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safra Catz, Oracle’s sole chief executive from 2019 until she stepped down in September, resisted expanding its cloud business because of the vast expenses required. She was replaced by co-CEOs Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as part of the pivot by Oracle to a new era focused on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catz, who is now executive vice-chair of Oracle’s board, has exercised stock options and sold $2.5 billion of its shares this year, according to US regulatory filings. She had announced plans to exercise her stock options at the end of 2024.&lt;br /&gt;

The tech giant is expanding availability for its AI-powered “Flight Deals” tool, adding the ability for users to organize travel plans with its “Canvas” tool in AI Mode, and launching agentic booking capabilities to more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google first launched Flight Deals back in August in the U.S., Canada, and India. Now, the company is expanding the AI-powered search tool within Google Flights globally to help people quickly find affordable destinations.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To get started, users need to describe where, when, and how they want to travel. Flight Deals will then use AI to display the best bargains available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Flight Deals is now rolling out to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, including the U.K., France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, and Korea. The tool is also getting support for more than 60 languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3068346" height="378" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-10.00.32-AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for the new AI Mode features, Google says users can now use the built-in Canvas tool to create travel plans. Canvas, which first launched as a way to build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel, can now help users plan their upcoming trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users need to tell AI mode what type of trip they’re looking for and then select the “Create with Canvas” option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Right away, you’ll get a plan in the Canvas side panel that brings together real-time Search data for flights and hotels, details from Google Maps like photos and reviews and relevant information from sites across the web,” Google explained in a blog post. “You’ll find suggestions that fit your criteria, like hotel comparisons based on pricing and amenities or ideas for restaurants and activities optimized by travel time from where you’re staying.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can then ask follow-up questions and get help with tradeoffs, like choosing a hotel that’s closer to a brunch place you want to try but a bit further from the hiking trails you want to explore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3068347" height="381" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-10.01.35-AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Travel planning with Canvas is available on desktop in the U.S. for users who are opted into the AI Mode experiment in Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, Google announced that it’s bringing AI Mode’s agentic capabilities to more people. Earlier this year, Google announced that users who were opted into Labs could now get help with booking restaurant reservations, event tickets, and beauty and wellness appointments in AI Mode. Now, the company is making this capability available to all U.S. users. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can request dinner reservations based on multiple preferences, such as party size, date, time, location, and preferred cuisine. AI Mode will then search across different reservation platforms to find real-time availability for restaurants that match the inquiry. It then surfaces a curated list of options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the future, Google says it will make it possible to finish booking flights and hotels directly in AI Mode. Users will be able to describe what they’re looking for and then compare different flights or hotels and browse information like schedules, prices, room photos, amenities, and reviews. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google is rolling out new AI-powered features to book and plan travel in Search, the company announced on Monday.
