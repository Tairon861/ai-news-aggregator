He’ll stick around through spring as an adviser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;His replacement is Amar Subramanya, a highly regarded Microsoft executive who spent 16 years at Google, most recently leading engineering for the Gemini Assistant. It’s a savvy hire, given that Subramanya knows the competition intimately.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move is being characterized as a shake-up. It was seemingly inevitable in retrospect. Apple Intelligence, the company’s answer to the ChatGPT moment, has been stumbling since its October 2024 launch. Reviews have ranged from “underwhelming” to outright alarmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Its first months were some of the roughest. A notification summary feature meant to condense multiple alerts into digestible snippets generated a series of embarrassing, untrue headlines in late 2024 and early 2025. Among other missteps, the BBC complained twice after Apple Intelligence falsely reported that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself (he hadn’t) and that a darts player, Luke Littler, won a championship before the final even began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then there was Siri’s promised overhaul, which became a black eye for Apple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Bloomberg investigation published in May revealed the depths of Apple’s AI struggles. For instance, when Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, tested the new Siri on his own phone just weeks before its planned launch in April, he was dismayed to find that many of the features the company had been touting didn’t work. The launch was delayed indefinitely, triggering class-action lawsuits from iPhone 16 buyers who’d been promised an AI-powered assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By that point, Giannandrea had already been sidelined, according to Bloomberg. The news organization reported that Tim Cook had stripped Siri from Giannandrea’s oversight entirely back in March, handing it to Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. Apple removed its secretive robotics division from Giannandrea’s control, too.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bloomberg’s investigation painted a picture of organizational dysfunction, with weak communication between AI and marketing teams, budget misalignments, and a leadership crisis severe enough that some employees had taken to mockingly calling Giannandrea’s group “AI/MLess.” The report also documented an exodus of AI researchers to competitors, including OpenAI, Google, and Meta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple is reportedly now leaning on Google’s Gemini to power the next version of Siri, an astonishing and, presumably, humbling twist considering the intense rivalry between the two companies that dates back more than 15 years, across mobile operating systems, app stores, browsers, maps, cloud services, smart home devices, and now AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Giannandrea came to Apple from Google, where he ran Machine Intelligence and Search. At Apple, he oversaw the AI strategy, machine learning infrastructure, and Siri development.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now Subramanya inherits those responsibilities, reporting to Federighi with a clear mandate to help Apple catch up in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s an interesting moment for the company. While competitors have been pouring billions of dollars into massive AI data centers, Apple has focused on processing AI tasks directly on users’ devices using its custom Apple Silicon chips, a privacy-first approach that avoids collecting user data. (When more complex requests require cloud processing, Apple routes them through Private Cloud Compute, servers that promise to process data temporarily and delete it immediately.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whether that philosophy pays off or whether it has permanently left Apple behind is an outstanding question. Apple’s approach comes with clear trade-offs. Among them, on-device models are smaller and less capable than the massive models running in competitors’ data centers, and Apple’s reluctance to collect user data has left its researchers training models on licensed and synthetic data rather than the giant troves of real-world information that fuel its rivals’ systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tcdisrupt_sf17_johngiannadrea-3043.jpg?resize=1200,869" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;In a carefully worded announcement on Monday, Apple said John Giannandrea, who has been the company’s AI chief since 2018, is “stepping down” to, well, not work at Apple anymore.

While OpenAI fielded its own open source, general purpose LLM this summer as well — &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-returns-to-open-source-roots-with-new-models-gpt-oss-120b-and-gpt-oss-20b"&gt;gpt-oss-20B and 120B&lt;/a&gt; — the uptake has been &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mdsjn2/unbelievable_china_dominates_top_10_opensource/"&gt;slowed by so many equally or better performing alternatives. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, one small U.S. company is pushing back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://x.com/arcee_ai/status/1995600354374025395"&gt;Arcee AI announced&lt;/a&gt; the release of Trinity Mini and Trinity Nano Preview, the first two models in its new “Trinity” family—an open-weight MoE model suite fully trained in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can try the former directly for themselves in a chatbot format on Acree&amp;#x27;s new website, &lt;a href="https://chat.arcee.ai/"&gt;chat.arcee.ai&lt;/a&gt;, and developers can download the code for both models on &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/arcee-ai/trinity"&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/a&gt; and run it themselves, as well as modify them&lt;!-- --&gt;/fine-tune&lt;!-- --&gt; to their liking — all for free under an enterprise-friendly Apache 2.0 license.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While small compared to the largest frontier models, these releases represent a rare attempt by a U.S. startup to build end-to-end open-weight models at scale—trained from scratch, on American infrastructure, using a U.S.-curated dataset pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m experiencing a combination of extreme pride in my team and crippling exhaustion, so I&amp;#x27;m struggling to put into words just how excited I am to have these models out,&amp;quot; wrote Arcee Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Lucas Atkins in &lt;a href="https://x.com/latkins/status/1995592666164363335?s=20"&gt;a post on the social network X (formerly Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;Especially Mini.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third model, Trinity Large, is already in training: a 420B parameter model with 13B active parameters per token, scheduled to launch in January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to add something that has been missing in that picture,” Atkins wrote in the &lt;a href="https://www.arcee.ai/blog/the-trinity-manifesto"&gt;Trinity launch manifesto&lt;/a&gt; published on Arcee&amp;#x27;s website. “A serious open weight model family trained end to end in America… that businesses and developers can actually own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Small Models to Scaled Ambition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trinity project marks a turning point for Arcee AI, which until now has been known for its compact, enterprise-focused models. The company has raised $29.5 million in funding to date, including a &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/small-language-models-rising-as-arcee-ai-lands-24m-series-a"&gt;$24 million Series A&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 led by Emergence Capital, and its previous releases include &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/arcee-opens-up-new-enterprise-focused-customizable-ai-model-afm-4-5b-trained-on-clean-rigorously-filtered-data"&gt;AFM-4.5B&lt;/a&gt;, a compact instruct-tuned model released in mid-2025, and &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/arcee-ai-unveils-supernova-a-customizable-instruction-adherent-model-for-enterprises"&gt;SuperNova&lt;/a&gt;, an earlier 70B-parameter instruction-following model designed for in-VPC enterprise deployment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were aimed at solving regulatory and cost issues plaguing proprietary LLM adoption in the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Trinity, Arcee is aiming higher: not just instruction tuning or post-training, but full-stack pretraining of open-weight foundation models—built for long-context reasoning, synthetic data adaptation, and future integration with live retraining systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally conceived as a stepping stone to Trinity Large, both Mini and Nano emerged from early experimentation with sparse modeling and quickly became production targets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Technical Highlights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinity Mini is a 26B parameter model with 3B active per token, designed for high-throughput reasoning, function calling, and tool use. Trinity Nano Preview is a 6B parameter model with roughly 800M active non-embedding parameters—a more experimental, chat-focused model with a stronger personality, but lower reasoning robustness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both models use Arcee’s new Attention-First Mixture-of-Experts (AFMoE) architecture, a custom MoE design blending global sparsity, local/global attention, and gated attention techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by recent advances from DeepSeek and Qwen, AFMoE departs from traditional MoE by tightly integrating sparse expert routing with an enhanced attention stack — including grouped-query attention, gated attention, and a local/global pattern that improves long-context reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of a typical MoE model like a call center with 128 specialized agents (called “experts”) — but only a few are consulted for each call, depending on the question. This saves time and energy, since not every expert needs to weigh in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes AFMoE different is how it decides which agents to call and how it blends their answers. Most MoE models use a standard approach that picks experts based on a simple ranking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFMoE, by contrast, uses a smoother method (called sigmoid routing) that’s more like adjusting a volume dial than flipping a switch — letting the model blend multiple perspectives more gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “attention-first” part means the model focuses heavily on how it pays attention to different parts of the conversation. Imagine reading a novel and remembering some parts more clearly than others based on importance, recency, or emotional impact — that’s attention. AFMoE improves this by combining local attention (focusing on what was just said) with global attention (remembering key points from earlier), using a rhythm that keeps things balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, AFMoE introduces something called gated attention, which acts like a volume control on each attention output — helping the model emphasize or dampen different pieces of information as needed, like adjusting how much you care about each voice in a group discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is designed to make the model more stable during training and more efficient at scale — so it can understand longer conversations, reason more clearly, and run faster without needing massive computing resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many existing MoE implementations, AFMoE emphasizes stability at depth and training efficiency, using techniques like sigmoid-based routing without auxiliary loss, and depth-scaled normalization to support scaling without divergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Model Capabilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinity Mini adopts an MoE architecture with 128 experts, 8 active per token, and 1 always-on shared expert. Context windows reach up to 131,072 tokens, depending on provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmarks show Trinity Mini performing competitively with larger models across reasoning tasks, including outperforming gpt-oss on the SimpleQA benchmark (tests factual recall and whether the model admits uncertainty), MMLU (Zero shot, measuring broad academic knowledge and reasoning across many subjects without examples), and BFCL V3 (evaluates multi-step function calling and real-world tool use):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MMLU (zero-shot):&lt;/b&gt; 84.95&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Math-500:&lt;/b&gt; 92.10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GPQA-Diamond:&lt;/b&gt; 58.55&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BFCL V3:&lt;/b&gt; 59.67&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latency and throughput numbers across providers like Together and Clarifai show 200+ tokens per second throughput with sub-three-second E2E latency—making Trinity Mini viable for interactive applications and agent pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinity Nano, while smaller and not as stable on edge cases, demonstrates sparse MoE architecture viability at under 1B active parameters per token. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Access, Pricing, and Ecosystem Integration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Trinity models are released under the permissive, enterprise-friendly, &lt;b&gt;Apache 2.0 license&lt;/b&gt;, allowing unrestricted commercial and research use. Trinity Mini is available via:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/arcee-ai"&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://openrouter.ai/arcee-ai/trinity-mini"&gt;OpenRouter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chat.arcee.ai/"&gt;chat.arcee.ai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;API pricing for Trinity Mini via &lt;a href="https://openrouter.ai/arcee-ai/trinity-mini"&gt;OpenRouter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$0.045 per million input tokens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$0.15 per million output tokens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A free tier is available for a limited time on OpenRouter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model is already integrated into apps including Benchable.ai, Open WebUI, and SillyTavern. It&amp;#x27;s supported in Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, LM Studio, and llama.cpp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data Without Compromise: DatologyAI’s Role&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to Arcee’s approach is control over training data—a sharp contrast to many open models trained on web-scraped or legally ambiguous datasets. That’s where &lt;a href="https://www.datologyai.com/"&gt;DatologyAI&lt;/a&gt;, a data curation startup co-founded by former Meta and DeepMind researcher Ari Morcos, plays a critical role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DatologyAI’s platform automates data filtering, deduplication, and quality enhancement across modalities, ensuring Arcee’s training corpus avoids the pitfalls of noisy, biased, or copyright-risk content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Trinity, DatologyAI helped construct a 10 trillion token curriculum organized into three phases: 7T general data, 1.8T high-quality text, and 1.2T STEM-heavy material, including math and code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the same partnership that powered Arcee’s AFM-4.5B—but scaled significantly in both size and complexity. According to Arcee, it was Datology’s filtering and data-ranking tools that allowed Trinity to scale cleanly while improving performance on tasks like mathematics, QA, and agent tool use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datology’s contribution also extends into synthetic data generation. For Trinity Large, the company has produced over 10 trillion synthetic tokens—paired with 10T curated web tokens—to form a 20T-token training corpus for the full-scale model now in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building the Infrastructure to Compete: Prime Intellect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arcee’s ability to execute full-scale training in the U.S. is also thanks to its infrastructure partner, &lt;a href="https://www.primeintellect.ai/"&gt;Prime Intellect&lt;/a&gt;. The startup, founded in early 2024, began with a mission to democratize access to AI compute by building a decentralized GPU marketplace and training stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Prime Intellect made headlines with its distributed training of INTELLECT-1—a 10B parameter model trained across contributors in five countries—its more recent work, including the 106B INTELLECT-3, acknowledges the tradeoffs of scale: distributed training works, but for 100B+ models, centralized infrastructure is still more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Trinity Mini and Nano, Prime Intellect supplied the orchestration stack, modified TorchTitan runtime, and physical compute environment: 512 H200 GPUs in a custom bf16 pipeline, running high-efficiency HSDP parallelism. It is also hosting the 2048 B300 GPU cluster used to train Trinity Large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaboration shows the difference between branding and execution. While Prime Intellect’s long-term goal remains decentralized compute, its short-term value for Arcee lies in efficient, transparent training infrastructure—infrastructure that remains under U.S. jurisdiction, with known provenance and security controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Strategic Bet on Model Sovereignty&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arcee&amp;#x27;s push into full pretraining reflects a broader thesis: that the future of enterprise AI will depend on owning the training loop—not just fine-tuning. As systems evolve to adapt from live usage and interact with tools autonomously, compliance and control over training objectives will matter as much as performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As applications get more ambitious, the boundary between ‘model’ and ‘product’ keeps moving,” Atkins noted in Arcee&amp;#x27;s Trinity manifesto. “To build that kind of software you need to control the weights and the training pipeline, not only the instruction layer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This framing sets Trinity apart from other open-weight efforts. Rather than patching someone else’s base model, Arcee has built its own—from data to deployment, infrastructure to optimizer—alongside partners who share that vision of openness and sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking Ahead: Trinity Large&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training is currently underway for Trinity Large, Arcee’s 420B parameter MoE model, using the same afmoe architecture scaled to a larger expert set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dataset includes 20T tokens, split evenly between synthetic data from DatologyAI and curated wb data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model is expected to launch next month in January 2026, with a full technical report to follow shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, it would make Trinity Large one of the only fully open-weight, U.S.-trained frontier-scale models—positioning Arcee as a serious player in the open ecosystem at a time when most American LLM efforts are either closed or based on non-U.S. foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A recommitment to U.S. open source&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a landscape where the most ambitious open-weight models are increasingly shaped by Chinese research labs, Arcee’s Trinity launch signals a rare shift in direction: an attempt to reclaim ground for transparent, U.S.-controlled model development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backed by specialized partners in data and infrastructure, and built from scratch for long-term adaptability, Trinity is a bold statement about the future of U.S. AI development, showing that small, lesser-known companies can still push the boundaries and innovate in an open fashion even as the industry is increasingly productized and commodtized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What remains to be seen is whether Trinity Large can match the capabilities of its better-funded peers. But with Mini and Nano already in use, and a strong architectural foundation in place, Arcee may already be proving its central thesis: that model sovereignty, not just model size, will define the next era of AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;For much of 2025, the frontier of open-weight language models has been defined not in Silicon Valley or New York City, but in Beijing and Hangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese research labs including Alibaba&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/its-qwens-summer-new-open-source-qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507-tops-openai-gemini-reasoning-models-on-key-benchmarks"&gt;Qwen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/deepseek-just-dropped-two-insanely-powerful-ai-models-that-rival-gpt-5-and"&gt;DeepSeek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/moonshots-kimi-k2-thinking-emerges-as-leading-open-source-ai-outperforming"&gt;Moonshot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/baidus-new-ernie-4-5-model-is-open-for-enterprise-use-with-apache-2-0"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt; have rapidly set the pace in developing large-scale, open Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models — often with permissive licenses and leading benchmark performance. While OpenAI fielded its own open source, general purpose LLM this summer as well — &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-returns-to-open-source-roots-with-new-models-gpt-oss-120b-and-gpt-oss-20b"&gt;gpt-oss-20B and 120B&lt;/a&gt; — the uptake has been &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mdsjn2/unbelievable_china_dominates_top_10_opensource/"&gt;slowed by so many equally or better performing alternatives. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, one small U.S. company is pushing back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://x.com/arcee_ai/status/1995600354374025395"&gt;Arcee AI announced&lt;/a&gt; the release of Trinity Mini and Trinity Nano Preview, the first two models in its new “Trinity” family—an open-weight MoE model suite fully trained in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can try the former directly for themselves in a chatbot format on Acree&amp;#x27;s new website, &lt;a href="https://chat.arcee.ai/"&gt;chat.arcee.ai&lt;/a&gt;, and developers can download the code for both models on &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/arcee-ai/trinity"&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/a&gt; and run it themselves, as well as modify them&lt;!-- --&gt;/fine-tune&lt;!-- --&gt; to their liking — all for free under an enterprise-friendly Apache 2.0 license.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While small compared to the largest frontier models, these releases represent a rare attempt by a U.S. startup to build end-to-end open-weight models at scale—trained from scratch, on American infrastructure, using a U.S.-curated dataset pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m experiencing a combination of extreme pride in my team and crippling exhaustion, so I&amp;#x27;m struggling to put into words just how excited I am to have these models out,&amp;quot; wrote Arcee Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Lucas Atkins in &lt;a href="https://x.com/latkins/status/1995592666164363335?s=20"&gt;a post on the social network X (formerly Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;Especially Mini.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third model, Trinity Large, is already in training: a 420B parameter model with 13B active parameters per token, scheduled to launch in January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to add something that has been missing in that picture,” Atkins wrote in the &lt;a href="https://www.arcee.ai/blog/the-trinity-manifesto"&gt;Trinity launch manifesto&lt;/a&gt; published on Arcee&amp;#x27;s website. “A serious open weight model family trained end to end in America… that businesses and developers can actually own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Small Models to Scaled Ambition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trinity project marks a turning point for Arcee AI, which until now has been known for its compact, enterprise-focused models. The company has raised $29.5 million in funding to date, including a &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/small-language-models-rising-as-arcee-ai-lands-24m-series-a"&gt;$24 million Series A&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 led by Emergence Capital, and its previous releases include &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/arcee-opens-up-new-enterprise-focused-customizable-ai-model-afm-4-5b-trained-on-clean-rigorously-filtered-data"&gt;AFM-4.5B&lt;/a&gt;, a compact instruct-tuned model released in mid-2025, and &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/arcee-ai-unveils-supernova-a-customizable-instruction-adherent-model-for-enterprises"&gt;SuperNova&lt;/a&gt;, an earlier 70B-parameter instruction-following model designed for in-VPC enterprise deployment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were aimed at solving regulatory and cost issues plaguing proprietary LLM adoption in the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Trinity, Arcee is aiming higher: not just instruction tuning or post-training, but full-stack pretraining of open-weight foundation models—built for long-context reasoning, synthetic data adaptation, and future integration with live retraining systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally conceived as a stepping stone to Trinity Large, both Mini and Nano emerged from early experimentation with sparse modeling and quickly became production targets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Technical Highlights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinity Mini is a 26B parameter model with 3B active per token, designed for high-throughput reasoning, function calling, and tool use. Trinity Nano Preview is a 6B parameter model with roughly 800M active non-embedding parameters—a more experimental, chat-focused model with a stronger personality, but lower reasoning robustness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both models use Arcee’s new Attention-First Mixture-of-Experts (AFMoE) architecture, a custom MoE design blending global sparsity, local/global attention, and gated attention techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by recent advances from DeepSeek and Qwen, AFMoE departs from traditional MoE by tightly integrating sparse expert routing with an enhanced attention stack — including grouped-query attention, gated attention, and a local/global pattern that improves long-context reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of a typical MoE model like a call center with 128 specialized agents (called “experts”) — but only a few are consulted for each call, depending on the question. This saves time and energy, since not every expert needs to weigh in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes AFMoE different is how it decides which agents to call and how it blends their answers. Most MoE models use a standard approach that picks experts based on a simple ranking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFMoE, by contrast, uses a smoother method (called sigmoid routing) that’s more like adjusting a volume dial than flipping a switch — letting the model blend multiple perspectives more gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “attention-first” part means the model focuses heavily on how it pays attention to different parts of the conversation. Imagine reading a novel and remembering some parts more clearly than others based on importance, recency, or emotional impact — that’s attention. AFMoE improves this by combining local attention (focusing on what was just said) with global attention (remembering key points from earlier), using a rhythm that keeps things balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, AFMoE introduces something called gated attention, which acts like a volume control on each attention output — helping the model emphasize or dampen different pieces of information as needed, like adjusting how much you care about each voice in a group discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is designed to make the model more stable during training and more efficient at scale — so it can understand longer conversations, reason more clearly, and run faster without needing massive computing resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many existing MoE implementations, AFMoE emphasizes stability at depth and training efficiency, using techniques like sigmoid-based routing without auxiliary loss, and depth-scaled normalization to support scaling without divergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Model Capabilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinity Mini adopts an MoE architecture with 128 experts, 8 active per token, and 1 always-on shared expert. Context windows reach up to 131,072 tokens, depending on provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmarks show Trinity Mini performing competitively with larger models across reasoning tasks, including outperforming gpt-oss on the SimpleQA benchmark (tests factual recall and whether the model admits uncertainty), MMLU (Zero shot, measuring broad academic knowledge and reasoning across many subjects without examples), and BFCL V3 (evaluates multi-step function calling and real-world tool use):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MMLU (zero-shot):&lt;/b&gt; 84.95&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Math-500:&lt;/b&gt; 92.10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GPQA-Diamond:&lt;/b&gt; 58.55&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BFCL V3:&lt;/b&gt; 59.67&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latency and throughput numbers across providers like Together and Clarifai show 200+ tokens per second throughput with sub-three-second E2E latency—making Trinity Mini viable for interactive applications and agent pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinity Nano, while smaller and not as stable on edge cases, demonstrates sparse MoE architecture viability at under 1B active parameters per token. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Access, Pricing, and Ecosystem Integration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Trinity models are released under the permissive, enterprise-friendly, &lt;b&gt;Apache 2.0 license&lt;/b&gt;, allowing unrestricted commercial and research use. Trinity Mini is available via:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/arcee-ai"&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://openrouter.ai/arcee-ai/trinity-mini"&gt;OpenRouter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chat.arcee.ai/"&gt;chat.arcee.ai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;API pricing for Trinity Mini via &lt;a href="https://openrouter.ai/arcee-ai/trinity-mini"&gt;OpenRouter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$0.045 per million input tokens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$0.15 per million output tokens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A free tier is available for a limited time on OpenRouter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model is already integrated into apps including Benchable.ai, Open WebUI, and SillyTavern. It&amp;#x27;s supported in Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, LM Studio, and llama.cpp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data Without Compromise: DatologyAI’s Role&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to Arcee’s approach is control over training data—a sharp contrast to many open models trained on web-scraped or legally ambiguous datasets. That’s where &lt;a href="https://www.datologyai.com/"&gt;DatologyAI&lt;/a&gt;, a data curation startup co-founded by former Meta and DeepMind researcher Ari Morcos, plays a critical role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DatologyAI’s platform automates data filtering, deduplication, and quality enhancement across modalities, ensuring Arcee’s training corpus avoids the pitfalls of noisy, biased, or copyright-risk content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Trinity, DatologyAI helped construct a 10 trillion token curriculum organized into three phases: 7T general data, 1.8T high-quality text, and 1.2T STEM-heavy material, including math and code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the same partnership that powered Arcee’s AFM-4.5B—but scaled significantly in both size and complexity. According to Arcee, it was Datology’s filtering and data-ranking tools that allowed Trinity to scale cleanly while improving performance on tasks like mathematics, QA, and agent tool use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datology’s contribution also extends into synthetic data generation. For Trinity Large, the company has produced over 10 trillion synthetic tokens—paired with 10T curated web tokens—to form a 20T-token training corpus for the full-scale model now in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building the Infrastructure to Compete: Prime Intellect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arcee’s ability to execute full-scale training in the U.S. is also thanks to its infrastructure partner, &lt;a href="https://www.primeintellect.ai/"&gt;Prime Intellect&lt;/a&gt;. The startup, founded in early 2024, began with a mission to democratize access to AI compute by building a decentralized GPU marketplace and training stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Prime Intellect made headlines with its distributed training of INTELLECT-1—a 10B parameter model trained across contributors in five countries—its more recent work, including the 106B INTELLECT-3, acknowledges the tradeoffs of scale: distributed training works, but for 100B+ models, centralized infrastructure is still more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Trinity Mini and Nano, Prime Intellect supplied the orchestration stack, modified TorchTitan runtime, and physical compute environment: 512 H200 GPUs in a custom bf16 pipeline, running high-efficiency HSDP parallelism. It is also hosting the 2048 B300 GPU cluster used to train Trinity Large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaboration shows the difference between branding and execution. While Prime Intellect’s long-term goal remains decentralized compute, its short-term value for Arcee lies in efficient, transparent training infrastructure—infrastructure that remains under U.S. jurisdiction, with known provenance and security controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Strategic Bet on Model Sovereignty&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arcee&amp;#x27;s push into full pretraining reflects a broader thesis: that the future of enterprise AI will depend on owning the training loop—not just fine-tuning.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the Commerce Department will provide the funding to xLight in exchange for an equity stake that will likely make the government the startup’s largest shareholder. The deal uses funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act and represents the first Chips Act award in President Trump’s second term, though it remains preliminary and subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Previous government equity investments under the Trump administration include publicly traded companies Intel, MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals. Two rare earths startups also secured funding in exchange for equity from the Commerce Department last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can imagine how this is all going over in Silicon Valley, where the libertarian ethos runs deep. At TechCrunch’s signature Disrupt event back in October, Sequoia Capital’s Roelof Botha jokingly offered what might be the understatement of the year when asked about the trend: “[Some] of the most dangerous words in the world are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other VCs have similarly expressed concerns, if quietly, about what it means when their portfolio companies are suddenly competing against startups backed by the U.S. Treasury, or even when they find themselves sitting across the table from government representatives at board meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The four-year-old, Palo Alto, California, company at the center of this particular experiment is trying to do something genuinely audacious in semiconductor manufacturing. XLight wants to build particle accelerator-powered lasers — machines the size of a football field, mind you — that would create more powerful and precise light sources for making chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If it works, it could challenge the near-total dominance of ASML, the Dutch giant that has been publicly traded since 1995 and currently enjoys an absolute monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography machines. (Its shares have surged 48.6% this year.)&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The CEO of xLight is Nicholas Kelez, a quantum computing and government labs veteran who presumably knows his way around a particle accelerator. Helping this venture as executive chairman is Pat Gelsinger, the former Intel CEO who was shown the door late last year after his ambitious manufacturing revival plans failed to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I wasn’t done yet,” Gelsinger — who is also a general partner at Playground Global, which led the startup’s $40 million funding round this summer — told the Journal, adding that the effort is “deeply personal” to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indeed, xLight doesn’t just want to compete with ASML but to go much further. While ASML’s machines work at wavelengths around 13.5 nanometers, xLight is targeting 2 nanometers. Gelsinger claims the technology could boost wafer processing efficiency by 30% to 40% while using far less energy.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As it happens, both Kelez and Gelsinger will be holding forth at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event on Wednesday night in Palo Alto, where the government’s backing will no doubt come up. (You can still nab a seat here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, for his part, insists this is all in service of national security and technological leadership, saying the partnership could “fundamentally rewrite the limits of chipmaking.” Critics will continue to question whether taxpayer-funded equity stakes represent visionary industrial policy or state capitalism with a patriotic sheen, though even skeptics acknowledge the geopolitical reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At least Botha, who described himself at Disrupt as a “sort of libertarian, free market thinker by nature,” conceded that industrial policy has its place when national interests demand it. “The only reason the U.S. is resorting to this is because we have other nation states with whom we compete who are using industrial policy to further their industries that are strategic and maybe adverse to the U.S. in long-term interests.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-09-at-12.38.58-PM.png?resize=1200,731" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The Trump administration has agreed to inject up to $150 million into xLight, a semiconductor startup developing advanced chip-making technology, marking the third time the U.S. government has taken an equity position in a private startup and further expanding a controversial strategy that has put Washington on the cap tables of American companies.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The CEO of xLight is Nicholas Kelez, a quantum computing and government labs veteran who presumably knows his way around a particle accelerator. Helping this venture as executive chairman is Pat Gelsinger, the former Intel CEO who was shown the door late last year after his ambitious manufacturing revival plans failed to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I wasn’t done yet,” Gelsinger — who is also a general partner at Playground Global, which led the startup’s $40 million funding round this summer — told the Journal, adding that the effort is “deeply personal” to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indeed, xLight doesn’t just want to compete with ASML but to go much further. While ASML’s machines work at wavelengths around 13.5 nanometers, xLight is targeting 2 nanometers. Gelsinger claims the technology could boost wafer processing efficiency by 30% to 40% while using far less energy.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As it happens, both Kelez and Gelsinger will be holding forth at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event on Wednesday night in Palo Alto, where the government’s backing will no doubt come up. (You can still nab a seat here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, for his part, insists this is all in service of national security and technological leadership, saying the partnership could “fundamentally rewrite the limits of chipmaking.” Critics will continue to question whether taxpayer-funded equity stakes represent visionary industrial policy or state capitalism with a patriotic sheen, though even skeptics acknowledge the geopolitical reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At least Botha, who described himself at Disrupt as a “sort of libertarian, free market thinker by nature,” conceded that industrial policy has its place when national interests demand it. “The only reason the U.S. is resorting to this is because we have other nation states with whom we compete who are using industrial policy to further their industries that are strategic and maybe adverse to the U.S. in long-term interests.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/what-does-it-mean-when-uncle-sam-is-one-of-your-biggest-shareholders-chip-startup-xlight-is-about-to-find-out/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 04:03:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] How OpenAI and Thrive are testing a new enterprise AI model (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/how-openai-and-thrive-are-testing-a-new-enterprise-ai-model/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Thrive Holdings’ push to modernise accounting and IT services is entering a new stage, as OpenAI prepares to take an ownership stake in the company and place its own specialists inside Thrive’s businesses. In doing so, OpenAI is testing an AI-driven model that pairs capital, sector expertise, and embedded technical teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrive started its holding company earlier this year to buy and manage firms in day-to-day service industries. Its aim has been to rebuild these companies with more efficient processes, new data practices, and practical uses of AI. OpenAI’s deeper involvement now turns that idea into a real-time experiment in how traditional providers can update their work without relying only on off-the-shelf tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A test case for bringing AI into core operational work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most enterprise discussions about AI tend to revolve around pilots and proof-of-concepts, Thrive is taking a different approach: buying companies outright and redesigning how they run. Its two current businesses – Crete Professionals Alliance (accounting) and Shield Technology Partners (IT services) – employ more than 1,000 people. Thrive has committed $500 million to Crete and, together with ZBS Partners, more than $100 million to Shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For companies watching from the outside, the appeal is clear. These industries carry heavy workloads, manual tasks, and tight margins. They also handle sensitive data and operate under strict deadlines. Any AI system introduced into that environment needs domain context, training, and adjustments that fit local processes – not generic automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crete has already begun using AI to cut down routine tasks like data entry and early-stage tax workflows. Shield is on track to complete 10 acquisitions by the end of the year, giving Thrive a base of IT operations which it intends to redesign with new tools and methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What OpenAI gains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is under pressure to find real, enterprise-scale use cases for its models. Investors value the company at roughly $500 billion, and its long-term commitments include about $1.4 trillion in infrastructure spending through 2033. To justify those figures, it is betting that businesses will spend heavily on tools that help them work faster and handle complex tasks at volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By taking a stake in Thrive Holdings, OpenAI gains something it cannot produce on its own: access to companies where it can experience models in day-to-day working, and training specialists on real operations. The more Thrive’s companies grow, the more OpenAI’s stake may expand, according to a person familiar with the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Kushner, founder of both Thrive Capital and Thrive Holdings, said, “We are excited to extend our partnership with OpenAI to embed their frontier models, products, and services into sectors we believe have tremendous potential to benefit from technological innovation and adoption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership also gives OpenAI a path to collect value from the engineering support it provides. Its team will develop custom models for Thrive’s companies and embed researchers and engineers on site, according to partner Anuj Mehndiratta, who oversees product and technology strategy at Thrive Holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What enterprises can learn from this approach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many companies, the hardest part of using AI is not the model but the redesign of existing work. Thrive’s strategy reflects a shift toward deeper integration, where AI teams sit inside the business units they support rather than acting as external advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model lets companies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build tools shaped around real workflows, not abstract use cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Train models on controlled, high-quality data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce the gap between engineering teams and front-line employees&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test changes faster, with direct feedback from staff&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also surfaces the real cost of AI adoption. Custom work requires engineering time, domain knowledge, and long-term alignment between owners and model developers. Thrive’s partnership with OpenAI formalises that alignment in a way that may become more common as enterprises look for results rather than demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s COO, said, “The partnership with Thrive Holdings is about demonstrating what’s possible when frontier AI research and deployment are rapidly deployed in entire organisations to revolutionise how businesses work and engage with customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The wider competitive landscape&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal lands at a time when AI companies are trying to anchor themselves inside major enterprise accounts. Anthropic is reaching more businesses through Microsoft partnerships, and. Google is drawing interest with its latest model and has seen its market value rise as companies explore new AI options. OpenAI, meanwhile, has taken stakes in partners like AMD and CoreWeave to support its long-term infrastructure needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI also expanded its reach on Monday this week, announcing a separate agreement with Accenture. Its ChatGPT Enterprise product will be rolled out to “tens of thousands” of Accenture employees, giving OpenAI another route into large-scale corporate use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A possible blueprint&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Thrive’s companies show meaningful improvement in how they operate, the model could influence how other enterprises think about AI transformation. Rather than layering tools on top of old processes, some may move toward deeper restructuring, guided by technical teams that understand both the model and the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Thrive Holdings serves as a live case study of what that approach looks like when applied to industries that rarely make tech headlines but form the backbone of day-to-day business operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: AI business reality – what enterprise leaders need to know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111016" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The DeepSeek V3.2 AI model matches OpenAI’s GPT-5 in reasoning benchmarks despite using ‘fewer total training FLOPs’ – a breakthrough that could reshape how the industry thinks about building advanced artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, the release demonstrates that frontier AI capabilities need not require frontier-scale computing budgets. The open-source availability of DeepSeek V3.2 lets organisations evaluate advanced reasoning and agentic capabilities while maintaining control over deployment architecture – a practical consideration as cost-efficiency becomes increasingly central to AI adoption strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hangzhou-based laboratory released two versions on Monday: the base DeepSeek V3.2 and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, with the latter achieving gold-medal performance on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad and International Olympiad in Informatics – benchmarks previously reached only by unreleased internal models from leading US AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accomplishment is particularly significant given DeepSeek’s limited access to advanced semiconductor chips due to export restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resource efficiency as a competitive advantage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s achievement contradicts the prevailing industry assumption that frontier AI performance requires greatly scaling computational resources. The company attributes this efficiency to architectural innovations, particularly DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), which substantially reduces computational complexity while preserving model performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The base DeepSeek V3.2 AI model achieved 93.1% accuracy on AIME 2025 mathematics problems and a Codeforces rating of 2386, placing it alongside GPT-5 in reasoning benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Speciale variant was even more successful, scoring 96.0% on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) 2025, 99.2% on the Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament (HMMT) February 2025, and achieving gold-medal performance on both the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad and International Olympiad in Informatics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are particularly significant given DeepSeek’s limited access to the raft of tariffs and export restrictions affecting China. The technical report reveals that the company allocated a post-training computational budget exceeding 10% of pre-training costs – a substantial investment that enabled advanced abilities through reinforcement learning optimisation rather than brute-force scaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Technical innovation driving efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DSA mechanism represents a departure from traditional attention architectures. Instead of processing all tokens with equal computational intensity, DSA employs a “lightning indexer” and a fine-grained token selection mechanism that identifies and processes only the most relevant information for each query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach reduces core attention complexity from O(L²) to O(Lk), where k represents the number of selected tokens – a fraction of the total sequence length L. During continued pre-training from the DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus checkpoint, the company trained DSA in 943.7 billion tokens using 480 sequences of 128K tokens per training step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architecture also introduces context management tailored for tool-calling scenarios. Unlike previous reasoning models that discarded thinking content after each user message, the DeepSeek V3.2 AI model retains reasoning traces when only tool-related messages are appended, improving token efficiency in multi-turn agent workflows by eliminating redundant re-reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enterprise applications and practical performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For organisations evaluating AI implementation, DeepSeek’s approach offers concrete advantages beyond benchmark scores. On Terminal Bench 2.0, which evaluates coding workflow capabilities, DeepSeek V3.2 achieved 46.4% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model scored 73.1% on SWE-Verified, a software engineering problem-solving benchmark, and 70.2% on SWE Multilingual, demonstrating practical utility in development environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In agentic tasks requiring autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning, the model showed significant improvements over previous open-source systems. The company developed a large-scale agentic task synthesis pipeline that generated over 1,800 distinct environments and 85,000 complex prompts, enabling the model to generalise reasoning strategies to unfamiliar tool-use scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek has open-sourced the base V3.2 model on Hugging Face, letting enterprises implement and customise it without vendor dependencies. The Speciale variant remains accessible only through API due to higher token use requirements – a trade-off between maximum performance and deployment efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industry implications and acknowledgement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release has generated substantial discussion in the AI research community. Susan Zhang, principal research engineer at Google DeepMind, praised DeepSeek’s detailed technical documentation, specifically highlighting the company’s work stabilising models post-training and enhancing agentic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing ahead of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems has amplified attention. Florian Brand, an expert on China’s open-source AI ecosystem attending NeurIPS in San Diego, noted the immediate reaction: “All the group chats today were full after DeepSeek’s announcement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledged limitations and development path&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s technical report addresses current gaps compared to frontier models. Token efficiency remains challenging – the DeepSeek V3.2 AI model typically requires longer generation trajectories to match the output quality of systems like Gemini 3 Pro. The company also acknowledges that the breadth of world knowledge lags behind leading proprietary models due to lower total training compute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future development priorities include scaling pre-training computational resources to expand world knowledge, optimising reasoning chain efficiency to improve token use, and refining the foundation architecture for complex problem-solving tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: AI business reality – what enterprise leaders need to know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111016" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gradium has developed audio language AI models designed to deliver voice at scale with ultra-low latency — essentially, AI voices that respond almost instantly. It was founded just a few months ago,&amp;nbsp;in September, 2025, by Kyutai founding member Neil Zeghidour, who cut his teeth working with voice models as a researcher at Google DeepMind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup’s goal, it says, is to make voice models speedier and more accurate for developers. And, as a European startup, it launched with multilingual support out of the gate: English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese, with additional languages coming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, Gradium is entering a race with plenty of competition. For starters, the frontier LLM companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta Llma, and Mistral all have voice, speech recognition, and multimodal models. Then there are well-funded startups like ElevenLabs, and hundreds of voice/speech models on Hugging Face. Right now, there’s no shortage of options for a developer needing AI voice capabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, the need for what Gradium hopes to offer — ultra-realistic voice expression and accuracy — will only grow over time, as AI moves from typed chats to AI agents and expands into use cases from entertainment to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/speech-recognition.png?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Gradium, a startup spun out of French AI lab Kyutai (backed by French telecom billionaire Xavier Niel), launched out of stealth on Tuesday with a $70 million seed round from a who’s who of investors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Researchers from MIT, Northeastern University, and Meta recently released a paper suggesting that large language models (LLMs) similar to those that power ChatGPT may sometimes prioritize sentence structure over meaning when answering questions. The findings reveal a weakness in how these models process instructions that may shed light on why some prompt injection or jailbreaking approaches work, though the researchers caution their analysis of some production models remains speculative since training data details of prominent commercial AI models are not publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Chantal Shaib and Vinith M. Suriyakumar, tested this by asking models questions with preserved grammatical patterns but nonsensical words. For example, when prompted with “Quickly sit Paris clouded?” (mimicking the structure of “Where is Paris located?”), models still answered “France.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests models absorb both meaning and syntactic patterns, but can overrely on structural shortcuts when they strongly correlate with specific domains in training data, which sometimes allows patterns to override semantic understanding in edge cases. The team plans to present these findings at NeurIPS later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a refresher, syntax describes sentence structure—how words are arranged grammatically and what parts of speech they use. Semantics describes the actual meaning those words convey, which can vary even when the grammatical structure stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semantics depends heavily on context, and navigating context is what makes LLMs work. The process of turning an input, your prompt, into an output, an LLM answer, involves a complex chain of pattern matching against encoded training data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate when and how this pattern-matching can go wrong, the researchers designed a controlled experiment. They created a synthetic dataset by designing prompts in which each subject area had a unique grammatical template based on part-of-speech patterns. For instance, geography questions followed one structural pattern while questions about creative works followed another. They then trained Allen AI’s Olmo models on this data and tested whether the models could distinguish between syntax and semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a “spurious correlation” where models in these edge cases treated syntax as a proxy for the domain. When patterns and semantics conflict, the research suggests, the AI’s memorization of specific grammatical “shapes” can override semantic parsing, leading to incorrect responses based on structural cues rather than actual meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In layperson terms, the research shows that AI language models can become overly fixated on the style of a question rather than its actual meaning. Imagine if someone learned that questions starting with “Where is…” are always about geography, so when you ask “Where is the best pizza in Chicago?”, they respond with “Illinois” instead of recommending restaurants based on some other criteria. They’re responding to the grammatical pattern (“Where is…”) rather than understanding you’re asking about food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates two risks: models giving wrong answers in unfamiliar contexts (a form of confabulation), and bad actors exploiting these patterns to bypass safety conditioning by wrapping harmful requests in “safe” grammatical styles. It’s a form of domain switching that can reframe an input, linking it into a different context to get a different result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the paper does not specifically investigate whether this reliance on syntax-domain correlations contributes to confabulations, though the authors suggest this as an area for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When patterns and meaning conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure the extent of this pattern-matching rigidity, the team subjected the models to a series of linguistic stress tests, revealing that syntax often dominates semantic understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team’s experiments showed that OLMo models maintained high accuracy when presented with synonym substitutions or even antonyms within their training domain. OLMo-2-13B-Instruct achieved 93 percent accuracy on prompts with antonyms substituted for the original words, nearly matching its 94 percent accuracy on exact training phrases. But when the same grammatical template was applied to a different subject area, accuracy dropped by 37 to 54 percentage points across model sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested five types of prompt modifications: exact phrases from training, synonyms, antonyms, paraphrases that changed sentence structure, and “disfluent” (syntactically correct nonsense) versions with random words inserted. Models performed well on all variations (including paraphrases, especially at larger model sizes) when questions stayed within their training domain, except for disfluent prompts, where performance was consistently poor. Cross-domain performance collapsed in most cases, while disfluent prompts remained low in accuracy regardless of domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify these patterns occur in production models, the team developed a benchmarking method using the FlanV2 instruction-tuning dataset. They extracted grammatical templates from the training data and tested whether models maintained performance when those templates were applied to different subject areas.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests on OLMo-2-7B, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o-mini revealed similar drops in cross-domain performance. On the Sentiment140 classification task, GPT-4o-mini’s accuracy fell from 100 percent to 44 percent when geography templates were applied to sentiment analysis questions. GPT-4o dropped from 69 percent to 36 percent. The researchers found comparable patterns in other datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also documented a security vulnerability stemming from this behavior, which you might call a form of syntax hacking. By prepending prompts with grammatical patterns from benign training domains, they bypassed safety filters in OLMo-2-7B-Instruct. When they added a chain-of-thought template to 1,000 harmful requests from the WildJailbreak dataset, refusal rates dropped from 40 percent to 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers provided examples where this technique generated detailed instructions for illegal activities. One jailbroken prompt produced a multi-step guide for organ smuggling. Another described methods for drug trafficking between Colombia and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Limitations and uncertainties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings come with several caveats. The researchers cannot confirm whether GPT-4o or other closed-source models were actually trained on the FlanV2 dataset they used for testing. Without access to training data, the cross-domain performance drops in these models might have alternative explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmarking method also faces a potential circularity issue. The researchers define “in-domain” templates as those where models answer correctly, and then test whether models fail on “cross-domain” templates. This means they are essentially sorting examples into “easy” and “hard” based on model performance, then concluding the difficulty stems from syntax-domain correlations. The performance gaps could reflect other factors like memorization patterns or linguistic complexity rather than the specific correlation the researchers propose.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study focused on OLMo models ranging from 1 billion to 13 billion parameters. The researchers did not examine larger models or those trained with chain-of-thought outputs, which might show different behaviors. Their synthetic experiments intentionally created strong template-domain associations to study the phenomenon in isolation, but real-world training data likely contains more complex patterns in which multiple subject areas share grammatical structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the study seems to put more pieces in place that continue to point toward AI language models as pattern-matching machines that can be thrown off by errant context. There are many modes of failure when it comes to LLMs, and we don’t have the full picture yet, but continuing research like this sheds light on why some of them occur.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Researchers from MIT, Northeastern University, and Meta recently released a paper suggesting that large language models (LLMs) similar to those that power ChatGPT may sometimes prioritize sentence structure over meaning when answering questions. The findings reveal a weakness in how these models process instructions that may shed light on why some prompt injection or jailbreaking approaches work, though the researchers caution their analysis of some production models remains speculative since training data details of prominent commercial AI models are not publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Chantal Shaib and Vinith M. Suriyakumar, tested this by asking models questions with preserved grammatical patterns but nonsensical words. For example, when prompted with “Quickly sit Paris clouded?” (mimicking the structure of “Where is Paris located?”), models still answered “France.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests models absorb both meaning and syntactic patterns, but can overrely on structural shortcuts when they strongly correlate with specific domains in training data, which sometimes allows patterns to override semantic understanding in edge cases. The team plans to present these findings at NeurIPS later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a refresher, syntax describes sentence structure—how words are arranged grammatically and what parts of speech they use. Semantics describes the actual meaning those words convey, which can vary even when the grammatical structure stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semantics depends heavily on context, and navigating context is what makes LLMs work. The process of turning an input, your prompt, into an output, an LLM answer, involves a complex chain of pattern matching against encoded training data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate when and how this pattern-matching can go wrong, the researchers designed a controlled experiment. They created a synthetic dataset by designing prompts in which each subject area had a unique grammatical template based on part-of-speech patterns. For instance, geography questions followed one structural pattern while questions about creative works followed another. They then trained Allen AI’s Olmo models on this data and tested whether the models could distinguish between syntax and semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a “spurious correlation” where models in these edge cases treated syntax as a proxy for the domain. When patterns and semantics conflict, the research suggests, the AI’s memorization of specific grammatical “shapes” can override semantic parsing, leading to incorrect responses based on structural cues rather than actual meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In layperson terms, the research shows that AI language models can become overly fixated on the style of a question rather than its actual meaning. Imagine if someone learned that questions starting with “Where is…” are always about geography, so when you ask “Where is the best pizza in Chicago?”, they respond with “Illinois” instead of recommending restaurants based on some other criteria. They’re responding to the grammatical pattern (“Where is…”) rather than understanding you’re asking about food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates two risks: models giving wrong answers in unfamiliar contexts (a form of confabulation), and bad actors exploiting these patterns to bypass safety conditioning by wrapping harmful requests in “safe” grammatical styles. It’s a form of domain switching that can reframe an input, linking it into a different context to get a different result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the paper does not specifically investigate whether this reliance on syntax-domain correlations contributes to confabulations, though the authors suggest this as an area for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When patterns and meaning conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure the extent of this pattern-matching rigidity, the team subjected the models to a series of linguistic stress tests, revealing that syntax often dominates semantic understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team’s experiments showed that OLMo models maintained high accuracy when presented with synonym substitutions or even antonyms within their training domain. OLMo-2-13B-Instruct achieved 93 percent accuracy on prompts with antonyms substituted for the original words, nearly matching its 94 percent accuracy on exact training phrases. But when the same grammatical template was applied to a different subject area, accuracy dropped by 37 to 54 percentage points across model sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested five types of prompt modifications: exact phrases from training, synonyms, antonyms, paraphrases that changed sentence structure, and “disfluent” (syntactically correct nonsense) versions with random words inserted. Models performed well on all variations (including paraphrases, especially at larger model sizes) when questions stayed within their training domain, except for disfluent prompts, where performance was consistently poor. Cross-domain performance collapsed in most cases, while disfluent prompts remained low in accuracy regardless of domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify these patterns occur in production models, the team developed a benchmarking method using the FlanV2 instruction-tuning dataset. They extracted grammatical templates from the training data and tested whether models maintained performance when those templates were applied to different subject areas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests on OLMo-2-7B, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o-mini revealed similar drops in cross-domain performance. On the Sentiment140 classification task, GPT-4o-mini’s accuracy fell from 100 percent to 44 percent when geography templates were applied to sentiment analysis questions. GPT-4o dropped from 69 percent to 36 percent. The researchers found comparable patterns in other datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also documented a security vulnerability stemming from this behavior, which you might call a form of syntax hacking. By prepending prompts with grammatical patterns from benign training domains, they bypassed safety filters in OLMo-2-7B-Instruct. When they added a chain-of-thought template to 1,000 harmful requests from the WildJailbreak dataset, refusal rates dropped from 40 percent to 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers provided examples where this technique generated detailed instructions for illegal activities. One jailbroken prompt produced a multi-step guide for organ smuggling. Another described methods for drug trafficking between Colombia and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Limitations and uncertainties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings come with several caveats. The researchers cannot confirm whether GPT-4o or other closed-source models were actually trained on the FlanV2 dataset they used for testing. Without access to training data, the cross-domain performance drops in these models might have alternative explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmarking method also faces a potential circularity issue. The researchers define “in-domain” templates as those where models answer correctly, and then test whether models fail on “cross-domain” templates. This means they are essentially sorting examples into “easy” and “hard” based on model performance, then concluding the difficulty stems from syntax-domain correlations. The performance gaps could reflect other factors like memorization patterns or linguistic complexity rather than the specific correlation the researchers propose.&lt;/p&gt;
