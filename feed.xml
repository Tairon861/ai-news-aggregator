On Thursday she rejected their dismissal requests and set the case for a jury trial in late April, meaning they’ll officially duke it out in an Oakland courtroom, with Microsoft also dragged into the legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The backstory reads like a tech soap opera. Musk and Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI with others in 2015 as a nonprofit with lofty charitable goals. But those fuzzy feelings didn’t last — Musk left and in 2023 started his own AI company, xAI, and now claims his former partners betrayed their mission by taking billions from Microsoft and restructuring as a for-profit.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The relationships have seemingly curdled across the board. OpenAI and Microsoft remain business partners but increasingly compete head-to-head in AI. Meanwhile, Musk and Altman have gone from collaborators to arch enemies, with OpenAI dismissing Musk’s lawsuit as “baseless” and “harassment” and an attempt to slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The judge found enough evidence to let a jury decide whether OpenAI broke its nonprofit commitments. A jury will also now decide whether Microsoft knowingly helped OpenAI break its promises, though the judge dismissed Musk’s claim that Microsoft unjustly enriched itself at his expense.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1126475976.jpg?resize=1200,1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI and Microsoft tried to dodge a courtroom showdown with Elon Musk, but a federal judge wasn’t having it, as reported earlier by Bloomberg.

The move underscores how India is becoming a key battleground for AI companies looking to expand beyond the U.S. for major growth markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ghose brings deep big-tech operating experience to the role. She spent 24 years at Microsoft before stepping down in December 2025. Her appointment gives Anthropic a seasoned executive with local enterprise and government relationships as it gears up to establish an on-the-ground presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing AI markets.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has become one of Anthropic’s most strategically important markets, with the country already ranking as the second-largest user base for Claude and usage heavily skewing toward technical and work-related tasks, including software development. Arch-rival OpenAI is also sharpening its focus on the market with plans to open an office in New Delhi — a sign India is fast becoming one of the most contested arenas in the global race to commercialize generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While India offers enormous scale — with more than a billion internet subscribers and over 700 million smartphone users — converting that reach into meaningful revenue has proven difficult, pushing AI companies to experiment with aggressive pricing and promotions. OpenAI last year introduced ChatGPT Go, its under-$5 plan aimed at attracting Indian users, and later made it available free for a year in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similar dynamics are playing out for Anthropic: its Claude app recorded a 48% increase from the previous year in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs, while consumer spending surged 572% to $195,000 for the month, per Appfigures — still modest compared with the U.S., where September spending hit $2.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic has been stepping up its engagement in India at the highest levels. Chief executive Dario Amodei visited in October and met corporate executives and lawmakers, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to discuss the company’s expansion plans and growing adoption of its tools. Anthropic had also explored a potential partnership with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries to broaden access to Claude, as TechCrunch reported previously. Reliance, however, ultimately struck a deal with Google to offer its Gemini AI Pro plan free to Jio subscribers. That move came as rival Bharti Airtel partnered with Perplexity to bundle access to its premium subscription, underscoring how India’s telecom giants have become critical distribution gatekeepers in the race to scale consumer AI services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a LinkedIn post announcing the move, Ghose said she would focus on working with Indian enterprises, developers and startups adopting Claude for “mission-critical” use cases, pointing to growing demand for what she described as “high-trust, enterprise-grade AI.” She added that AI tailored to local languages could be a “force multiplier” across sectors including education and healthcare — signaling Anthropic’s intent to deepen adoption beyond early tech users into larger institutions and the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The push by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Perplexity comes as India’s homegrown GenAI ecosystem remains relatively early-stage. While the country has a deep pool of software talent and a fast-growing base of AI users, it has produced few startups building large foundation models, with investors instead largely backing application-layer companies rather than committing the scale of capital typically required to train frontier systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The appointment also comes ahead of India’s AI Impact Summit 2026 in February, where the Indian government is expected to bring together AI startups, global CEOs, and industry experts to discuss the next phase of AI deployment in the country. The summit is part of New Delhi’s broader effort to signal support for domestic AI development and position India as a serious player in the global AI landscape, as competition intensifies across major markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic is also building out its India team, with job listings for roles including startup and enterprise account executives as well as a partner sales manager, signaling a push to deepen its go-to-market efforts and tap Indian businesses and startups as customers as it expands its presence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Anthropic, the hire adds senior local leadership as it looks to turn India’s surging usage into a durable business, navigating a market where distribution partnerships, pricing pressure, and enterprise adoption will shape which AI players emerge as long-term winners.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/anthropic-image-jagmeet-singh-techcrunch.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Anthropic has appointed Irina Ghose, a former Microsoft India managing director, to lead its India business as the U.S. AI startup prepares to open an office in Bengaluru.

As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A base-edited baby!&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took&amp;nbsp;his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;KJ’s&amp;nbsp;story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics,&amp;nbsp;a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have&amp;nbsp;described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Gene resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the&amp;nbsp;woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called&amp;nbsp;“woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves&amp;nbsp;is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about&amp;nbsp;the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in&amp;nbsp;attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Embryo scoring&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is&amp;nbsp;controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that&amp;nbsp;doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing,&amp;nbsp;you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to&amp;nbsp;have their “best baby.” Read more&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in&amp;nbsp;attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Embryo scoring&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is&amp;nbsp;controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that&amp;nbsp;doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing,&amp;nbsp;you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to&amp;nbsp;have their “best baby.” Read more&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

According to Plumery, the product is intended to reduce reliance on bespoke integrations and to promote an event-driven, API-first architecture that can scale as institutions grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge it seeks to address is recognised in the sector. Banks have invested heavily in AI experimentation over the past decade, but many deployments remain limited. Research by McKinsey suggests that while generative AI could materially improve productivity and customer experience in financial services, most banks struggle to translate pilots into production because of fragmented data estates and incumbent operating models. The consultancy argues that enterprise-level AI adoption requires shared infrastructure and governance, and reusable data products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comments accompanying the product launch, Plumery’s founder and chief executive, Ben Goldin, said financial institutions are clear about what they expect from AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They want real production use cases that improve customer experience and operations, but they will not compromise on governance, security or control,” he said. “The event-driven data mesh architecture transforms how banking data is produced, shared, and consumed, not adding another AI layer on top of fragmented systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fragmented data remains a barrier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data fragmentation remains one of the obstacles to operational AI in banking. Many institutions rely on legacy core systems that sit in newer digital channels, creating silos in products and customer journeys. Each AI initiative requires fresh integration work, security reviews, and governance approvals, thus increasing costs and slowing delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Academic and industry research supports this diagnosis. Studies on explainable AI in financial services note that fragmented pipelines make it harder to trace decisions and increase regulatory risk, particularly in areas like credit scoring and anti-money-laundering. Regulators have made clear that banks must be able to explain and audit AI-driven outcomes, regardless of where the models are developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plumery says its AI Fabric addresses such issues by presenting domain-oriented banking data as governed streams that can be reused in multiple use cases. The company argues that separating systems of record from systems of engagement and intelligence allows banks to innovate more safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Evidence of AI already in production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, AI is already embedded in many parts of the financial sector. Case studies compiled by industry analysts show widespread use of machine learning and natural language processing in customer service, risk management, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citibank, for example, has deployed AI-powered chatbots to handle routine customer enquiries, reducing pressure on call centres and improving response times. Other large banks use predictive analytics to monitor loan portfolios and anticipate defaults. Santander has publicly described its use of machine learning models to assess credit risk and strengthen portfolio management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fraud detection is another mature area. Banks rely increasingly on AI systems to analyse transaction patterns, flagging anomalous behaviour more effectively than rule-based systems. Research from technology consultancies notes that such models depend on high-quality data flows, and that integration complexity remains a limiting factor for smaller institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More advanced applications are emerging at the margins. Academic research into large language models suggests that, under strict governance, conversational AI could support certain transactional and advisory functions in retail banking. However, these implementations remain experimental and are closely scrutinised due to their regulatory implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Platform providers and ecosystem approaches&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plumery operates in a competitive market of digital banking platforms that position themselves as orchestration layers rather than replacements for core systems. The company has entered partnerships designed to fit into broader fintech ecosystems. Its integration with Ozone API, an open banking infrastructure provider, was presented as a way for banks to deliver standards-compliant services more quickly, without custom development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its approach reflects a wider industry trend towards composable architectures. Vendors like Backbase and others promote API-centric platforms that allow banks to plug in AI, analytics, and third-party services to the existing core. Analysts agree generally that such architectures are better suited to incremental innovation than large-scale system replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Readiness remains uneven&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that readiness in the sector is uneven. A report by Boston Consulting Group found that fewer than a quarter of banks believe they are prepared for large-scale AI adoption. The gap, it argued, lies in governance, data foundations, and operating discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators have responded by offering controlled environments for experimentation. In the UK, regulatory sandbox initiatives allow banks to test new technologies, including AI. These programmes are intended to support innovation and reinforce accountability and risk management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For vendors like Plumery, the opportunity lies in providing infrastructure that aligns technological ambition and regulatory reality. AI Fabric enters a market where demand for operational AI is apparent, but where success depends on proving that new tools can be safe and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Plumery’s approach becomes a adopted standard remains uncertain. As banks move from experimentation to production, the focus is moving towards the architectures that support AI. In that context, platforms that can demonstrate technical flexibility and governance adherence are more likely to play an important role in the digital banking’s next phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Colorful Shale Strata of the Morrison Formation at the Edge of the San Rafael Swell” by Jesse Varner is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
